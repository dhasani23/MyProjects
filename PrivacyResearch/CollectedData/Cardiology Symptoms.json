    "content": "I am a 37yr old woman who has been dealing with SVT since I was 21, I was told I had something called Winkibauch syndrome (Sorry for the miss-spelling) only to find out this past year that I do NOT have that I have SVT which when told about the symptoms sounded more like what I was going through. I was even told I had asthma, and was using an inhaler, which seemed to make things worse. I had an EP study which I was told would fix the problem, but when they went in there to do it they couldn't find the area to ablate! Now after a battery of stress tests, pills and halter monitors, and listening to doctors and nurses say \"well there it is, I can see it right there\" while looking at my EKG's I am going in for another EP study, I don't want to sound negative, but if for some reason they can not find the area to ablate what can I look forward to? a lifetime of pill taking?  more EP studies? Needless to say I am very frustrated, I led a fairly active lifestyle but now I can't even walk to get my mail without having to stop to catch my breath (the box is only two house down from me) and gaining more and more weight, I just would like to know there is some kind of happy ending in all this, Thank you for listening to me whine (lol)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ltarrats,  Wenckebach is a condition where the heart drops a beat every so often.  SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) is a condition where the heart begins to race rapidly (often at rates of over 200).  AVNRT (AV nodal reentrant tachycardia) is a form of SVT.  Generally, what occurs in these conditions is that there is an extra pathway that allows the electrical signal to travel backwards back up to the top of the AV node (a place that coordinates contraction of the lower chambers of the heart).  Usually the electricity can only travel downward preventing any problems.  When this pathway is present it can allow the electricity to travel backward and cause the node to refire when it shouldn't.  This sets up a circular cycle that rapidly accelerates the heart rate.    EP studies attempt to find this extra pathway and ablate it to stop the cycle.  The tricky part is finding it.  Remember that an ECG (or EKG, same thing) looks from the outside and gives a \"big picture\" view.  When the cardiologist does the catheterization they are using small wires and looking for a very precise area.  This can be much more tricky to find.  Occasionally, it can take more than one cath procedure to find and ablate the right spot.    If it can't be found there are other ways to treat it, varying depending on how often you have the symptoms.  Keep following up with your cardiologist.  Perhaps this next cath will be the one that finds your accessory tract and gets it taken care of.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "[color=blue]I'm a 47 year old female in good health.  In the last year or so, I have noticed that about two or three times a month, I get a fluttering sensation in my chest, this is immediately followed by what I would describe as a 'catch' in my breath, and then a need to cough to 'set things right again\".  Afterward, I will often feel a slight headache or mild pressure in my head.  This can occur when i am very warm or when I lay down, but sometimes when I am sitting also, but not necessary any or all of these need be present.   Other than the slight aching in my head and an ever so slight tired feeling for a while, I am fine, and the episode will pass.  I exercise 3 x a week and am not overweight, BP is fine.  Family history of high BP, controlled by medications, but I have never had it.  These episodes, because they involve my chest and head, do concern me.  I mentioned it to OB/GYN last year, but she didn't seem concerned and didn't pursue it.  What do you think?  Thanks for your time.[/color]\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Cindy - What you describe is a classic picture of a very common, very normal (yet often also very aggravating) phenomenon known as premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) or premature atrial contractions (PACs). These occur in almost everyone from time to time, but some of us feel every one while others are totally unaware they are happening. What takes place is this: a tiny area in the upper or lower chambers of the heart becomes momentarily irritable and triggers a heartbeat in advance of the next regular one. The heart, wanting to keep everything in order, pauses for a split second in order for the next regular (sinus) beat to occur. The early beat usually causes the flutter sensation and a sort of \"void\" sensation that some describe as taking ones breath away for a second. This usually is because the premature beat has occurred when the pulmonary valve of the heart is closed, which makes the early beat more noticeable and provokes the feeling of a need to cough. It is all very simple, and takes place in less than a second, but depending on what part of the heart's cycle it occurs in, it can seem like a rather dramatic and weird sensation. The mild pressure in the head you describe is also commonly described in association with this, but is really not significant - and neither are the premature beats.   You mention this happens \"about two or three times a month.\" It may surprise you to know that many people have hundreds of these per day, often not even noticing them. When they are as infrequent as yours are they do tend to be more noticeable and tend to feel more dramatic. However, they are almost never important, especially when they occur so infrequently.   PVCs and PACs occur most often at rest, but can also happen during activity. They happen often just as one is getting ready to go to sleep, and many people complain they notice them if they lay on their left side at bedtime. Caffeine use can make them more frequent, but as infrequent as yours are I don't think I'd bother to try eliminating caffeine (unless you are really taking in huge amounts of it).   The aching in your head and the slight tired feeling are probably jtotally unrelated to these palpitations you've mentioned, and may be viral in origin, or emotional, or maybe just an occasional headache and fatigue. Hard to say, but again, not significant, at least in the context presented here.   You sound like a very healthy young woman noticing a very normal and common but sometimes anxiety producing thing that you may feel free to ignore to as great an extent as possible.   Good luck to you and please do keep in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Quite often, and especially in the ER setting where anxious patients show up with this complaint, the doctor's explanation that' \"it's nothing\" is simply inadequate, yet there is little time for the actual doctor to sit down and explain the mechanism of the sensation and why it's \"nothing.\" Once the patient has become chronically anxious he will likely feel more of the palpitations for two reasons: 1) because he is now attuned to them and they are difficult to miss or ignore, and 2) because the anxiety caused by the sensations, initially, if sustained, will just cause the release of more adrenaline, which is one of the prime aggravators of this almost always benign problem. It is, in fact, not a problem in any absolute sense, which is why doctors tend to brush it off, not realizing the patient, feeling brushed off, develops doubts about the completeness of the exam and often will begin to believe something has been overlooked.   I'd suggest perhaps you direct your father to a recent blog post here on the site (under \"Blogs\") titles \"Benign Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Anxious Patient.\" Hopefully this more lengthy explanation, aimed at both professionals and patients, might help your father understand the gap between what most doctors feel is adequate reassurance and what is really needed to help get the patient to accept that the problem is rather like a fit of sneezing, nothing more.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you both.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I have recently had a couple of attacks of severe chest pain on the left side just above the breast, which also radiates to the left shoulder and a little through to the back. The pain feels like a heavy weight. I also felt very dizzy, nauseous, and became extremely sweaty. I ended up going to the Emergency department and they ran an ECG. They said it was pretty close to normal, however I had some flattening on the T waves, whatever that means. No further tests were done at that time. I have also experienced a rather strange feeling, where not only do I become aware of my heart beating, but it seems beat very quickly for a few seconds, then flutter irregularly and then it feels like it stops beating (for only a microsecond I suspect). Almost every day I feel my heart beat at some point and it seems to 'skip a beat', but once again this fluttery feeling is quite different, and makes me feel very strange and unwell. It doesn't seem to be realated to eating or exercise that I can see. I'm worried further testing would be difficult because this occurs rarely and it would be hard for them to monitor my heart at that exact moment. Do you believe this is an issue, or just normal? Are there certain heart issues that arent detected by an ECG? Thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It is possible that you have palpitations of an as yet undetermined nature. Normally one is unaware of the respiratory or the cardiac activity.When one starts 'feeling' the heart beats,palpitation is said to exist. This could mean one of two things. - that a person may have started to concentrate on the normal heart beats, or - that an abnormality of cardiac activity(rhythm or rate) draws one's attention to it.  There are many causes of palpitations.Broadly, they may be - cardiac or - non-cardiac causes.  Some of the non-cardiac causes include, - hypoxia, - anemia, - hyperthyroid states, - excessive intake of nicotine, alcohol or caffine, - drugs such as amphetamins,and - psychiatric illnesses such as panic attacks or anxiety.   Palpitations may be accompanied by other symptoms such as breathlessness, chest pain/discomfort or even syncopal attacks.  In symptomatic individuals, especially when the palpitations are episodic and infrequent, a continuous 24 hours Holter monitoring is indicated.If organic causes are excluded, then functional causes need to be considered.  Good luck!\n\n",

I've gone for a coronary angiography in 2001 and 2005. the one in 2001 was fairly normal but the one in 2005 showed fixed stenosis of the LAD. i m currently on nitrates, aspirin and CCB's and have suffered from 2 non-ST elevation MI's 2 and 3 years ago respectively. i m still suffering from squeezing chest pains in the early mornings, almost daily especially if i have had a long day. Recently, i m also having chest discomfort when i over exert myself, when i m having an asthma attack or when i have a heavy meal.it feels like a ton of weight on my chest that gets relieved with rest. i think i m no longer responding to the nitrates.my EF is 50-55%. my physician has suggested for another angiogram prefably one with ergonovine and a possible stenting if necessary. my question is, is there another drug to replace the nitrate? is there structural damage to the heart due to the spasms?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, manic63,  You have a complex condition, but you describe all the appropriate measures being taken.  The angiogram with ergonovine really is the next step to be taken, to identify any fixed stenotic lesions or to determine if revascularization is indicated.  Your ejection fraction is within acceptable limits, all things considered.  Calcium-channel blockers my also be effective, if the nitrates are no longer achieving the desired control.  If there are fixed stenoses identified, beta-blockers may have a role in management of your symptoms.  That would best be determined by your cardiologist, of course.  Have you maintained a diary of your anginal episodes?  If not, please consider doing so, noting when they occur, the duration, and what you were doing when they occurred.  This can help your physician track any diagnostic patterns, contributing factors, and any acceleration of your condition.  Always take it with you when you see your physicians.  Memory can fallible, and a record of your symptoms is pretty clear.   The anginal spasms probably do not cause any structural damage; rather, they may contribute to myocardial infarction, as you have already experienced, and the MI can result in at least temporary structural damage.  However, often the residual scar tissue is stronger than the previously weakened heart muscle.  I hope this is helpful to you, and I wish you the most positive results of your upcoming tests.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 20 year old active female. When I was about 15 I began to get these short stabbing pains that seemed to be coming from my heart. It tend to happen about twice a day lasting for a few short seconds to a minute at times. Sometimes the pain would be minor, at other times it was very incapacitating to the point where I would grab the area and fall to my knees.   Sometimes I go long periods of time where I wont feel this pain for weeks on end but it always has come back for the last five years at some point.   The pain is only in the left side of my chest. It doesn't spread anywhere else. I am not even sure if it is even my heart or perhaps something else.  I have had a Stress Test and an Echocardiogram but both came up negative for anything out of the ordinary.   What makes this so hard on me is that no one can seem to tell me what's wrong and my stress goes up because of it.  I should also state that I am in the military and have been for the last 3 years so I am quite fit. I don't believe it is the stress from my job that is causing this because I felt them long before I joined. Is there a chacne stress could be causing it to keep happening though? I don't have any known heart disease in my family. My older sister did have a serious heart condition when she was young and now has an artificial valve.   Now comes the brutally honest truth. I seem to recall this pain occuring shortly after a very stupid decision in my early teen years to smoke marajuana which I later found out had traces of windex in it. At the time of that stupid choice I felt an excrutiating chest pain that caused the world to spin and me to blackout. I felt as if I was having a heart attack at 15 though I am sure that wasn't it. I haven't touched a single illegal substance since then but the pain still comes around. Could this at all be related to my chest pain? I should also note that my older sister (the same one with the heart condition) made the same stupid choice when she was in her mid teens and had the exact same thing happen to her. Please let me know what you think. I can't describe what I have gone through to try and get this figured out. Thanks so much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sparky1897,  What you are describing sounds very much like a syndrome called Precordial Catch Syndrome.  It is currently not well understood what causes this syndrome.  It is characterized by sharp, stabbing type pain in the chest often described as if something is caught.  The pain is intense until it finally \"gives\" and goes away.  Often, the pain episodes can be intense enough to cause a person to hold their breath briefly in pain.  This syndrome is probably a form of pleurisy, which is an inflammation of the lining of the lungs.  It can be set off initially by viral infections, trauma, or possibly even irritation from an inhaled irritant such as the laced marijuana (though this is certainly not a definite cause).  It can sometimes be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen.  If this is what is going on, it is not dangerous just annoying painful.  I would suggest you see a doctor at some point to have a full evaluation and make sure that nothing more concerning is going on.  Just as a side note, this does not sound like heart related pain.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  over the last few days, i've noticed a strange, dull ache in the area of my left wrist and forearm.  i'm not quite sure if there is a numbness or tingling, but there is a dull achy feeling that seems to come and go in waves.  i'm having some difficulty further describing this ache since it is vague.  i seem to have no chest discomfort or pain, but i am worried if this could be a cardiac problem.  i'm in my early twenties and have no other health problems.  i am slightly overweight according to my BMI; i do not perform daily exercise, but i watch my diet; and i do have a hectic daily routine.  can you please let me know what this could be, if it's heart related, and if i should be worried?  thanks so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello sj,  The publicized cardiac symptom of pain radiating down the left arm generally involves the entire arm and the pain is generally constant.  Having the pain localized in the lower arm and happening in waves would not immediately suggest cardiac involvement.  Of course, there are atypical events, so checking with one's doctor is always best.  A hectic daily routine may be a contributor, particularly if repeated use of the left hand is required, such as with carpal tunnel syndrome or other neurological effect.  If there is swelling, periods of ice applications may be indicated.  If the problem persists, please see your doctor for evaluation.  I hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, nomadfamily,  The symptoms you describe are not usually associated with a cardiac event.  If a person has had a long history of cardiac disease, the entire circulatory system can be affected, with pains in the extremities, but this doesn't appear to be the case with your wife.  Your name, nomadfamily, suggests you may not have a regular family physician.  However, your wife should see a doctor for a complete physical examination.  Her symptoms could be related to a circulatory disorder, such as a deep vein varicosity.  Is the temperature of her leg increased or decreased compared to her other leg?  Has she had pregnancies?  Does she have a regular exercise program, such a daily walks?  Is her lifestyle sedentary or active?  How much overweight is she?  All of these factors must be taken into consideration, and would be evaluated in a complete physical examination, as suggested.  Early intervention is the best key to successful treatment, so I urge her to see a doctor at the earliest opportunity.  I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck to you both.\n\n",

    "title": "Low Pulse Pressure - Very worried!",
    "content": "I'm a 28 year old female with prior history of benign heart arrythmias. Normal cardiac stress test 2 years ago, normal echo 1 year ago, and normal ECG 1 month ago. I have had intermittent episodes of high blood pressure associated with stress which last only minutes at a time. I am on no medication.   I was recently ill with some sort of stomach thing that caused me to vomit about 10 times in 12 hours and have a few bouts of diarrhea. I became pretty dehydrated but recovered in a few days. I'm listing this because it's when I first noticed this problem although I don't know if it is related or not.   I've been having a low pulse pressure for 2 and a half weeks now. It occurs when standing and after exercising. The most troublesome reading I've gotten was probably 98/83 and there have been variants such as today when it was 108/90. I've also seen 96/76. When I rest, my pulse pressure returns to normal with a blood pressure reading in the range of 105/65. My heart rate is also elevated with activity and standing though this is not terribly uncommon for me. It's been about 110-135 during these periods of low pulse pressure though I've seen it be 85 during a low PP as well.   My doctor is out of town this week and the nurse didn't seem to know what to say. She is having me come in to see the Nurse Practitioner on Friday but I don't feel very comfortable that I am not seeing a doctor for what I perceive as a possibly life threatening problem.   I read online that causes are heart failure, aorta problems, the list goes on but none are good and are all life threatening conditions.   So I guess my question is - is there ever an instance where this doesn't mean something really amaizingly horrible? Could it be a normal finding or caused by  something far less scary than heart failure?  And is it safe to wait until Friday and then see Nurse Pracitioner or should I got to the hospital so I can see a doctor right away?    I am really really really scared right now, please respond soon.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Low Pulse Pressure - Very worried!",
    "content": "Hi tiffairy -  Well, hopefully by now you  have your answer, but in case you don't, and for the benefit of others who may read this thread, the short answer is that this doesn't mean something really amazingly horrible. In fact, your blood pressure readings are all well within the range of normal. The fact that your pressure drops on standing is not at all unusual, and may be due to an benign phenomenon known as orthostatic hypotension (but very, very mild) or could be just because you don't wait a full minute after standing (as per medical protocol) to take your standing pressure. Your heart requires a minute at least to adjust to the change in posture. Still, the pressures you report here are perfectly fine. They would have to be a lot lower to even cause a second look.   Also, upon standing, one's heart rate will usually pick up anywhere from 5 to 20 beats per minute, especially during the first minute after standing. While the textbook norm for blood pressure and rate one minute after standing is an increase of 10 points in systolic pressure and about 10 beats per minute, this varies from person to person. We're not all exactly alike in this respect. There is a range of normal, as with most vital signs.   You strike me as possibly an anxious person, and it probably would be a good idea (if possible) for you to pay less and less attention to what your heart (and body in general) is doing, unless you are first experiencing disturbing symptoms.  Then they should be evaluated by a medical provider; you definitely aren't doing yourself any favors by trying to check your own hemodynamic status unless you have special medical training.   Hopefully by now you've been to the nurse practitioner and have been reassured about your pressure and pulse variations. Hopefully this will help you or someone like you who may read this. Good luck to you.\n\n",

She is talking about low PULSE PRESSURE.  There is a difference.  A HUGE difference.    Also, it's not really a good idea to tell someone to quit being stressed and to quit focusing on their body!  That's not your job!  You have not seen that person personally and shouldn't be saying such things!  The reality is that low PULSE pressure (which she CLEARLY DOES have) IS something that can be of concern.  It might not be, but it CAN be!  Amy\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Amy!  Thank you for your input. However, I am a little disappointed at the way you chose to express your concern and opinion. John, like everyone else here is a volunteer that tries his best to answer questions to the best of his knowledge for free. His work here is appreciated by everyone.   You have made an interesting comment which is why I am responding back. The definition of pulse pressure is directly related to blood pressure. The pulse pressure is defined as the systolic minus the diastolic pressure. One definition of the normal range for pulse pressure is between 25-50% of systolic blood pressure. Widened (elevated) pulse pressure is much more important with blood pressure readings taken from the general population (screening). These can indicate stiffening of the major arteries or conditions with increased cardiac output / hyperdynamic circulation.   In contrast, a low pulse pressure (definitions in the literature vary from 40 to 45mmHg) is only relevant in the setting of acute decompensated heart failure and possibly also in congestive heart failure. But, let me stress: in these two settings the low pulse pressure is important not from a diagnostic point of view but only from a prognostic angle. We NEVER diagnose these conditions by using low pulse pressure. This is because low pulse pressure is neither specific nor sensitive as a diagnostic test for these conditions. However, the finding of low pulse pressure in a patient with acute decompensated heart failure is related to the patient's expected survival as suggested by some studies.  There are three issues with the post that I am sure John was completely aware of when assessing his response to this question.   First, the notorious inaccuracy of home blood pressure readings. In order to assume that a patient has any blood pressure disorder this should be done by trained personnel using a professional blood pressure reading device.  Second, the lack of consistency in the readings is extremely important. When we say low pulse pressure has a prognostic significance in patients with heart failure we mean a CONSISTENTLY low pulse pressure.   Third, for the sake of the argument, were we to assume the patient has a clinically significant and consistent low pulse pressure and that this COULD be somehow related to something as serious as heart failure then other symptoms would predominate. The patient must have a significantly low blood pressure and a very rapid heart rate. In addition to other failure symptoms such as shortness of breath, etc.   Let me take this opportunity to insist that no one here offers any medical advice. We hope to educate and inform our visitors by answering their questions. They are always referred back to their physician / provider who is the only person that can give advice.  I hope my answer has helped explain what this post was about. Please let us know if you have any more concerns.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I am a healthy, 19 year old girl, with a healthy body, low blood pressure, average cholesterol, and am 5'3\" and weigh 135 pounds.  I have always participated in sports.  About 3 weeks ago, I was sitting on my bed one night, browsing the internet.  All of the sudden I felt tenseness and unease in my sternum.  I assumed maybe it was acid reflux, having never had experienced acid reflux or heard burn before, from a nice turkey dinner I had two hours before.   The tightness in my sternum increased so much that I wandered down to my parents bathroom where the ant-acid is, took two tablets, and went back up stairs to go to sleep.  At that point I laid down to go to sleep, and the pressure in my sternum was becoming to much, I kept wiggling around thinking another position would ease the pressure. That's when my heart started beating out of control, going from one second calm, to the next beating rapidly, and so violently I could feel it completely when I placed my hand over my chest.  Never, after all my years of soccer, cheerleading, and tennis, have I had my heart beat that HARD.  That is when my breathing became restrained, the tips of my left fingers and toes started tingling, and I felt on the verge of passing out.  I was too nervous to walk down the flight of stairs, for fear of fainting, and honestly, I'm not sure if I would have been able to move from my sitting on my bed position with my hand over my heard if I wanted to, because at this point my heart sharply hurt.  I used my phone to call my parents, and they came rushing up stairs.  I was afraid I was having some freak heart attack, and I could barely speak I was so out of breath, and so my parents called the police.  While we were waiting for the police, my mom made me take some deep breaths, which hurt incredibly bad, and then cough a few times.  At that point, my heart started to slow down, become less violent, and my breathing started to return to normal.  And then my heart skipped a beat and it started racing again. At that point my parents had me chew some aspirin.  By the time the police arrived, my heart had calmed down again, so they took me to the hospital.  In the hospital, they monitored my heart, discovering that my electrolytes were slightly low, and after having my blood drawn, and waiting for the results, it turned out my potassium was very low.  But other than that, my blood came back well, and after xraying my heart, they said it looked fine as well.  But they did not give me a Echocardiography which my family practitioner was upset about the next day when she found out they didn't give me one. They sent me off with the the advice of eating things with more potassium and drinking electrolyte enhance water. My heart was tired for a couple days at that point, feeling slightly tense like a muscle that I had exercised too hard.  A week later, I have been following their advice perfectly.  A banana every day for breakfast, a couple bottles of smart water, everything was going fine.  Then I was sitting in me be again, when all the sudden my heart started racing, and my breathing became labored.  I coughed a few times, took an aspirin, and my heart returned to normal.    A few days later I had another bad episode, while I was out walking with my friends.  My heart clenched up then started beating rapidly, and then my breathing became more labored that it did the first time, although my heart was less severe this time.  I took some aspirin right away, and coughed a few times, but it took a while for my breathing to return to normal, and my heart to calm down.    Is anyone able to make sense of this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello fpuub,  You have certainly had some frightening experiences with your symptoms!  You noted that your doctor was concerned that there had not been an echocardiogram - did she order one?  Have you had a cardiac workup to rule out any functional problems?  If not, discuss it with your doctor so that it can be arranged.  Another factor is that replacing extremely low potassium through potassium-rich foods and drinks can be too slow to address an acute problem.  Low potassium could certainly contribute to the symptoms that you describe.  There's a possibility of associated panic episodes in response to the symptoms, although that would not be my first guess.   The important thing is to identify what is causing your symptoms, and that can only be done through complete evaluation.  Please talk with your doctor again, with that in mind.  I also recommend that you start and maintain a record of your symptoms, noting the date, time, symptoms and their duration, and what you were doing at the time the symptoms occurred.  That will help your doctor determine if there is a particular pattern, which can be helpful in arriving at an accurate diagnosis.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- Owing to your relatively bad family history where heart disease is concerned, even though you likely do have an anxiety problem that may be causing the chest pains (the more random the pains the less likely they are heart related) you probably still should have an echocardiogram simply to determine if you may also have mitral valve prolapse (MVP) syndrome in association with the anxiety you suffer. While MVP is almost always benign and is very common, the syndrome which accompanies it can cause a whole galaxy of symptoms, some cardiac and some more unrelated in nature, as well as a great propensity for anxiety/panic disorder  Buspar is a very mild anti-anxiety drug that as a rule is only effective in mild cases of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Xanax is not an appropriate therapeutic medication for anxiety/panic, but is essentially a \"rescue\" drug to be taken at the first sign of panic onset. It isn't nearly as effective as a preventive drug. There are other far more effective (long term) medications, most of them of the SSRI family of antidepressants (as ironic as this may seem). I would discuss this with a psychiatrist or psychopharmacologist instead of a regular GP, as the former have much more insight into the workings of the brain/body connection.   The echocardiogram can rule MVP in or out, and this would be useful in terms of guiding medical treatment, since many MVPers benefit from use of a beta blocker drug rather than psychotropics, although the Xanax could be kept on perhaps in its intended role as a rescue drug to abort incipient panic attacks. These along with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), a self-limited interactive form of psychotherapy, is probably the best route to getting out from uder this cycle of symptoms, anxiety, panic and so forth.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

My Dad also has diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol. These symptoms just started about a week and a half ago if that. At first it was not happening every day but now it is and like I said I feel like it's in my left lung or left ribcage. And at night it's the worst especially when Im on my left side. It's almost like when Im laying there, it's  \"pressure\" on the left side of my chest and it makes breathing  harder. Please will someone help me, I am a little concerned. I have no health insurance so I can't go to a doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "For almost a month now I have had this sharp chest pain on my left side under my breast.  When it first started 2 months ago it came after I had shortness of breath, sweating, feeling of vomit, dizziness, near fainting, racing heart. I went to the ER they did and EKG it came back normal and then sent me home. Went to a walk in clinic two days later for the same thing they ran a blood test all came back normal.  Now ever since this happened  I have had this pain  on my left side under my breast that started out dull but has now gotten really sharp and always there . It  get worse when I twist left or right, taking a deep breath and when moving to a different position, stretching and lying on my left side  is painful too.  The pain goes from the center of my chest down under neath the left breast.  Sometimes if almost feels as if something is moving almost like a contraction .There will be this intense squeeze and release which when that happens it stops me in my tracks because it is extremely painful.    I am 27 years old mother of four children. I have family history of breast cancer which I just had a mammogram in December and that came back normal. My father was 56 when he died of a heart attach and my brother was 19 when he died from his heart stopping after a severe seizure.   I tried to make a appointment with my family doctor that I have now since I just got health insurance but he is on vacation and won't be back for 2 weeks in the mean time I am pain.   I have taken almost every over the counter medication to see if anything would relieve this pain and nothing has worked so I have no idea what these could be.  I hope some one has an answer to what this could be. I am about ready to just go to the local ER again.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Left chest pain under breast",
    "content": "Hi there -  What you're describing is almost certainly not heart-related. The reason I say that is that cardiac pain can't be duplicated by movement (such as twisting of the torso) or breathing in. Most often this is caused, instead, by either an inflammation of the cartilage between the ribs (costochondritis), but sometimes is also caused by chest wall irritation, inflammation of the pleura (the lining between the lungs and the chest wall), or of the chest wall muscles themselves. Since you also describe a sensation of a painful contraction, which would suggest possible muscle spasm. Otherwise it is most likely constochondritis. In any of these cases the treatment is the same, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such  as ibuprofin or naproxyn (Advil or Aleve over the counter). Since those haven't worked for you, you may require some prescription  version or another prescription medication that does the same thing, only more powerful. It doesn't sound remotely like a heart-related problem.   You might ask why after onset of the first episode you had nausea, dizziness, rapid heartbeat,  etc. While  this could have been  a coincidence,  the more likely explanation would be an anxiety response to the chest pain you were feeling, especially since you have a family history of premature heart disease (your father). Most often people suffering from symptoms related to anxiety are the last to know that's what it is. It's not so much due to denial (although they will usually deny anxiety at the time -- because they are unaware that's what's going on), as that it comes up via a subconscious fear or concern.   While I am pretty well convinced you're not experiencing any heart problem right now (based on the symptoms as described), since you do have a family history of early heart disease you should be followed at least annually with an EKG  and blood lipid checks. This is only prudent in anyone with this  sort of family history, and especially for women,  who often present with vague and  atypical symptoms when and if they do develop problems. That being said, your  current symptoms really don't even fit the atypical patterns often seen in women  with heart disease.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here as needed. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "To jaysingsurri -  You say your pain is only relieved by sitting straight up in bed at night. While the sort of pain that mary81 has described is unlikely to be cardiac-related, there is an indirect possible relation to certain types of postional pain. Are you able to aggravate your pain by twisting of your torso or other movement? If so, then we'll wait to hear what mary81 has to say. However, if your pain occurs primarily when you lie down and goes away when you sit up, it could be due to inflammation of the pericardial sac around the heart, which usually also does respond to medications like naproxyn, but if there is significant fluid buildup along with the irritation, then the usual pain meds sometimes arean't as effective. So what I am asking is can your pain be aggravated by the same sort of motions as mary81 describes? If not, and if your pain only occurs when you lie on your back in bed, you probably should have pericarditis rule out. While it is not a heart pain per se, it doesn involve the protective sac around the heart and, if fluid buildup occurs, can affect the functioning of the heart. Just curious about this. Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm hoping someone can help me out here.  My symptoms are very similar as stated in the first post.  I'm 37 y/o female, 5 ft 6 in., 120 lbs and fairly healthy other than migraines.  I'm currently on amitryptylene for migraine prevention (10 mg/day).  Since about the 2nd last week of November 2008, I've been experiencing chest pains.  At first it started in the middle of my chest.  Whenever I bent down to pick something up or lay down (as I was getting into bed), I would experience a tightening in my chest.  About a week after I started noticing this pain, I started getting pain under my left breast.  I called a medical health line and they suggested I go to the ER.  At the ER, I had an ECG and an x-ray done.  Both came back clear and I was discharged with \"A-typical\" chest pains.  The pain never went away.  I saw my family doctor just before Christmas.  She had me do another ECG and some blood work.  The ECG came back clear but the blood work showed I had low platelets and was anemic.  Other than that, all other levels were good.  My doctor walked me to a chiropractor who then proceed to crack my back.  He suggested that my chest pain was caused by weak pec muscles and a blockage in my back.  He said the back cracking should help and if not, I should return for more alignments.  I have not returned to the chiropractor.  I am now approaching 3 months of chest pain and it's only getting worse.  Another trip to the ER and another ECG showed that all was clear.  Blood work was done and a special cardiac blood test was run.  My protein levels came back OK.  I have an appointment to meet with a cardiologist but that's not for another couple of weeks.  In the meantime, my chest pain is becoming worse.  I'm getting sharp pains around my whole heart (not just the bottom) which is now finding it's way to my back as well.  I have large palpitations while I'm sleeping.  So strong in fact that it's awaken me from sleep.  I just don't know what to do anymore.  My doctor says it's stress but I really can't think of anything stressing me out other than not figuring out what's happening.  My mid/upper chest pain is still there.  Again, aggravated when I bend down or reach over for something, i.e. to turn off alarm clock.  I have been avoiding sleeping on my left side.  Any suggestions?  Could this be some type of a chest infection if not a cardiac issue?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Left chest pain under breast",
    "content": "For looking4:  The fact that your chest pain is aggravated by certain positional changes would normally almost rule out cardiac involvement from the start; the fact that resting EKG and other tests have also agreed with that conclusion would seem to confirm this. Also, pain continuous over a period of months would usually not suggest cardiovascular disease, and that probably is not the cause. However, this could still be heart-related in a different way. The postural factor strongly suggests something inflammatory and the most likely thing, given the ways this can be aggravated, argue for costochondritis, but there is also a remote possibility this could be caused by pericarditis instead, and this should be ruled out. While I feel certain you've had at least one chest x-ray during this prolonged episode, and probably have had your heart listened to numerous times (all of which should have revealed pericarditis) it still should be definitively ruled out by an MD. The cardiologist will no doubt take care of that loose end right up front. If that's the problem it's usually fairly easily treated or managed.  If it's not that and there's nothing else that shows up on chest x-ray, the problem certainly would seem to be orthopedic/inflammatory in nature. I'm wondering, however, if it might not be somehow related to your taking amitriptyline, which can cause any number of cardiac symptoms -- and may well at least be the reason for the perceived increase and forcefulness of palpitations (this symptom, in itself, is generally inconsequential, but can at least serve as a clue to what may be going on). It can also cause other cardiac problems. Amitryptiline can also cause muscle stiffness, which may, in your case, have invaded the chest wall muscles.   I am also curious as to why the ER staff discharged you with \"atypical chest pain\" when that term only applies to suspicious or confirmed heart issues causing the pain. If heart-related problems are ruled out as the cause, or if the pain would seem to be unrelated to a heart issue, then they are no longer atypical, but just plain pain of unknown cause. There is a huge difference, which leaves me thinking there may have been some uncertainty as to whether or not this could be heart-related. Again, it really doesn't sound like it.   While there is a remote chance this could be true atypical presentation of some heart-related problem (the most likely of the unlikely would be pericarditis), it is more likely orthopedic/inflammatory in nature; whether or not it's being caused by the amitryptiline is open to debate and the only way to know for sure would be to stop that drug and switch to something else less noxious to try and prevent migraine (such as a beta blocking drug, which would also have some cardiac benefits, even if not needed).   I hope the cardiologist will be thorough in order to put your mind more at ease about this, and at the same time help narrow down the possible causes.   One other potential cause of this (and should your cardiac consult come up clean, as I expect it will), would be thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), which would require either a neurologist or orthopedist (or both) to rule in or out. This can cause diffuse chest pain at times, and since it is orthopedic with either nerve (and sometimes blood vessel) impingement causing the symptoms, can be influenced by position and, in fact, is often caused by faulty posture. Just something to think about once everything else is ruled out. (It's not life-threatening either, and often can be improved by physical therapy, home exercises, etc.).  I certainly hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mary and John,  Today I was diagnosed with Tietze Syndrome. I would like to describe how this may cover similar pains described by Mary. I have had sporadic spasms under my left breast while at rest my entire life. These spasms usually last about a minute and are always extremely painful. I cannot move. I have to take shallow breaths so as not to enhance the pain. I get lightheaded and my left arm will sometimes get soar. The most recent one was rather scary, about 5 minutes, and I returned to my doctor for advice.   Tietze Syndrome can last for years. It is characterized by pain left of the sternum in the chest. This sharp pain can be worstened by twisting or turning or expanding the chest. It is the result of an inflammation of the rib cardilage. The pain my radiate to other areas of the body and often mimics the pain of a heart attack. This is a combination of what I have researched and what my doctor told me.  My question is that Tietze Syndrome describes a pain that is closer to the center of the chest. My pain, although it has all the other symptoms I described, actually originates from deep under my left breast. Also, my doctor did not tell me how I may decrease the likehood of these attacks.  So I would like to know if I have an accurate idea of what Tietze Syndrome is. Do you agree that this is what I suffer from? What can I do to decrease the likelihood of an attack?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  The pain could be either heart or GI related. It could also be something entirely different. However, it would be wise to have heart disease (most likely structural because of his height and weight -- certain structural diseases of the heart are more common in athletes and very large people). Sometimes eating can provide enough additional stress on a heart that has a sturctural defect, to cause some mild symptoms. An echocardiogram and resting EKG, at a minimum, would be necessary to rule out this sort of problem and would also probably expose any suggestions of coronary artery disease (CAD) as well.   If both structural defects and CAD are ruled out, then it would be wise to move on to try and determine if there is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or esophogeal spasm causing the pain. If so, there are many medications which could help resolve this problem.   Obviously the most important thing would be to rule out any sort of heart-related problem. While you haven't mentioned his age, just based on  his height and weight he is statistically more inclined toward certain types of heart problems, and with the location and nature of the pain, it should be explored.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you both. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Although you may have used stimulants which are \"legal highs\" before, and though you smoke, both of which can affect your health adversely (note cigarettes are legal, yet can kill you over time) neither is probably responsible for your chest pains, which are a very common type of complaint, and are not cardiac in nature based upon your description. These are almost always musculoskeletal pains caused by irritation, strain or inflammation of the chest wall muscle, lining or cartilege between the ribs, and if very bothersome will often respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofin. Stretching and deep breathing exercises may also help, as well as application of warm compresses or warm showers. This problem can be chronic, but is rarely much of a concern, although it can be pretty annoying.   One other possibility is pleurisy, which is also due to an irritation of the lining between the lung and chest wall, and can cause pretty deep pain on inhalation, but usually follows a viral infection. The treatment is almost always the same as above anyway.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

The pain is right where my ribs meet my breast bone and sometimes a little higher up farther to left. I have been to ER over 15 times in the past 4 years EKG\"s, Ct scans where they injected dye into me or whatever. I also have had x-rays alot of blood work and a Nuclear Stress Test and not 1 single test ever came back with the slightest abnormality. The pain is on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the worst is like a 1-2 I  notice it there and thats about it. The pain does not take my breath away or is not brought on by and physical activity it's just there and sometimes i feel it in diffrent spots on my arm like my hand or my forearm. The pain orginated after i got off of a roller coaster, well atleast the first time I experienced the pain. I am kind of lost on what to do next the Dr's really don't think it is cardiac related at all and this pain has stressed me out very bad because I personally think it is cardiac but I have no other signs except the sharp stabbing pain it's almost like an ache. i figured i would come on here and get some opinions and go from there.\n\n",

If I do something physical there is a chance my chest pain will occur, but it often happens when I am in school or about to go to bed.  Occassionally my heart will beat hard as well but I think that is because I get nervous.  I am sure it is not acid as I do take prilosec regularly because I have GERD.  I also have gotten my blood pressure and cholesterol done and they are fine.  My pulse is around 65-70 bpm range. I have had this pain for about a month. it started after I had my first and only panic attack while smoking marijuana. It was only the third (most likely last) time i've smoked it in my life.  I am not sure if the pain caused the panic attack, or the panic attack caused the pain, or if there is no connection.  I also think of myself as anxious but this happens too often i think to be considered anxiety related. Much appreciated.\n\n",

I am reposting this because it went away for a month and came back after I had smoked marijuana again.  I was a tad anxious while intoxicated but nothing too major, I am sure it has to do with either the smoking, the THC, or the anxiety.  I was thinking that perhaps I have mild asthma brought on by the smoke since i do not smoke regularly.

    "content": "Hi again -  While dull pain or pressure beneath the breastbone is often suspect in nature, if it's only happening when you smoke, and you feel anxiety along with that, it may be either caused by the anxiety or by mild asthma, as you theorize. The infrequent smoking could cause mild asthma,which often  presents as chest tightness. If this discomfort should occur at other times,  especially during exertion, however, you then will need to be evaluated for possible heart problems. However, given the connection between the episodes of discomfort, anxiety and pot smoking, it seems most likely it is related to those things instead.   Keep us posted if anything changes. Otherwise,  good detective work. Stay well.\n\n",

    "content": "For BMW33oi: This definitely does sound like pleuritic pain, which can be very stubborn if not treated with anti-inflammatory medications. It also is problematic in that any form of smoking will aggravate it and can, in some instances, be the underlying cause. It would be well worth an experiment (laying off the marijuana) for a period of time (two weeks at least) to see if this doesn't resolve the problem. Also an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory (naproxen being the safest and very effective) may help.   Hope this is useful to you. Good luck and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm a 37 year old male who has had recurring chest discomfort and other heart related symptoms for about two years which include palpitations, skipped beats, chest tightness (mainly far left pectoral area), left arm pain and tightness, some lightheadness and slight dizziness, as well as shortness of breath. I have had the following tests done - numerous ekg's, stress echo (Jan 2008), echo (June 2008), holter monitor (July 2008, October 2008), CPET (April 2009), and blood work. All of the test were normal except my first holter monitor registered a slow heart rate during the late night, early morning hours so my cardiologist had me do it again in October which came out normal. My cholestrol is low (70 for 'bad', 35 for 'good', and triglycerides at 70.) My BP has had some high readings at the doctor's office (as high as 160/100; on average 140/85); but at home I consistently get readings around 110-130/70-85. My mom and brother do have hbp and are on medication but my doctor doesn't feel like it's necessary. My doctor attributes my symptoms to anxiety since I was cleared by the cardiologist and I have been receiving therapy for the past year (twice a month basis). While this has been helpful, it also has been hard to get over the hump that anxiety is the main cause of my symptoms. I also had my breathing issues checked out with a pulmonologist where he examined me and did the spirometry test. I also asked him if I could take an exercise test and he did the CPET test for me. My spirometry test did show some lower side of normal readings and my lowest reading was 79. He gave me some albuterol and also some alvesco as a controller to take once in a while when symptoms develop. The alvesco has proven helpful and after one 10 day treatment, I have used it on occassion when I feel symptoms slowly developing. I think allergies and air quality may have something to do with this slight asthma. (Also, when I was 13, I wheezed a few times and was given an inhaler which I never used). Anyways, besides this, I have not been diagnosed with anything. However, these symptoms still persist and the biggest difficulty is how I feel like I struggle with exercise. Before any of this happened, I had consistently and quite vigorously worked out - from running 4 to 8 miles at a time, to jump roping, doing resistance training, and other kinds of workouts - it was a big, regular part of my life. However since the symptoms began, I have become increasingly worried when I exercise. There is this tension that exists in that I want to exericise and miss it, but I am also worried if something might happen as I exercise and any symptom, feeling I have while exercising effects me. I am scanning and monitoring my body as I exercise. When I do feel symptoms, I try to push through them by telling myself that I have been checked out and that I'm okay but I still can't shake my fears not only during but after and before I exercise again. An example of this was a couple of weeks ago when I took my family for a short weekend vacation. I went to workout in the hotel gym twice while we were there. Both times, I rode an exercise bike and elliptical machine. I haven't used gym equipment for a couple of years. I used the bike first for about 25 minutes and then the elliptical for the same duration. While riding the bike, I felt slightly dizzy and a little nauseated. But I pushed through it telling myself to not be worried. When I rode the elliptical I felt better but I also experienced some of the chest tightness and discomfort that I often do. This made me think I was experiencing exercised induced angina. I fininshed my workout and then went back to my room. Had lingering symptoms for a couple of hours after workout. But it is not just when I actually work out - I feel symptomatic while at rest and also with minimal effort like walking up a flight of stairs. I can feel some palpitations and a little shortness of breath and then that worries me because I think something has to be wrong. My question is can anxiety be the root cause of my symptoms? And has my exercise struggles become the result of my anxiety or do I have some kind of condition that is producing these symptoms therefore making me anxious? Might I have some kind of slowly progressing heart issue that wasn't revealed in the tests I have taken and should I take some other tests? Can my worry whether conscious or sub conscious during exercise actually be producing these feelings and symptoms? My anxiety therapist says that moderate to vigorous exercise can amp up the nervous system thus producing some of these symptoms and feelings in someone with an anxiety condition. While I can understand that I have a hard time fully believing that is what is going on. I'm also frustrated because I want to feel normal again and I especialy want to be able to exercise freely again without concern. Any medical suggestions you can give. Your help in this matter would be greatly appreciated as I have been pretty frustrated. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Exercise Struggles, Exerices Fears",
    "content": "Hello -- I can tell you that an echocardiogram plus stress echo (including of course stress test) has ruled out any structural heart disease, which is what I always look for first in athletic people. You don't have structural heart disease, which at your age is the biggest concern among athletes. You've also ruled out, to a very reasonable degree, coronary artery disease, which otherwise would be fairly well down the list except for the symptoms you describe, if they were taken out of context. Fortunately they are not out of context here. You have been very forthcoming and your post is very detailed. You consider the possibility of anxiety and I am very much inclined, given the other rule outs, to believe this is the root cause of your symptoms and of course of your concern -- concern to the degree it's beginning to be disruptive.  To answer your last questions, anxiety absolutely can account for all this, and no, it would seem, given your various negative tests, there is no occult heart disease to worry about. If there were frank heart disease it would have shown itself, and the only occult (hidden) type would have been structural abnormalities which would have shown up on both echocardiograms. You tolerate exercise well but acknowlege anxiety over the symptoms, the only question left being: Which came first? As usual, the anxious person is the last to recognize this chain of events. It's almost always this way, is classic for anxiety. The patient often will deny any stress or life situation which could be causing this, and sometimes there actually is none, but rather some long-repressed concern which finds expression at last in concerns about physical problems, usually heart-related. Since the heart is a great barometer for anxiety (especially with regard to palpitations) and so much misinformation is common in the general public about heart disease symptoms, the most likely symptoms (according to the degree of knowlege the given patient has on the subject) will tend to be noticed. The symptoms may well be actual ones, but they are not heart-related and may well be trivial but maginified because of anxious concern.   This is difficult to word in such a way as to not sound judgemental of the patient, and that's unfortunate, because anxiety, in its own way, can be quite disabling though not life-threatening. Getting the patient to the point where he can understand the cycle of anxiety and break it is the hard part.  Something happened to shift your awareness and your concern to your heart. It could have been merely some random pain or palpitation (we all have those) but in the final analysis there's usually something else, often symbolic, that sends us off suddenly on that particular tangent. We rarely recognize it, and frankly once this cycle starts, the psychological trigger is moot. The trick becomes developing awareness of what we are doing.   You've been more than adequately cleared of suspicion of any sort of heart disease. A little knowlege can be a dangerous thing, though, especially in the hands (or mind) of someone who is anxiety-prone.   What I would suggest to you is if you cannot work through this on your own that you then seek out someone who practices cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which is a very effective and highly successful sort of limited, interactive psychotherapy involving \"homework.\" This is not endless \"talk therapy\" like regular insight therapy is, but rather a limited, goal oriented program to help one recognize the process, break the cycle, and essentially be \"cured\" of the problem. It may sound too easy to be true, and of course it doesn't work on 100 per cent of people, but it does have a high rate of success. If you hadn't already had all the tests you've had, medically, I wouldn't be making this suggestion,but you've had every exam I would have suggested, and you've passed with flying colors. That leaves anxiety as the default diagnosis, and it certanly fits, right down to the classic, highly detailed explanation in your post.   I hope this is helpful, and if you can work through this on your own that's great, but I also hope, if you cannot,that you're not one of those people who feels asking for help of a non-medical nature is a show of weakness. You'd be surprised how many people feel this way, or simply don't want to believe it can be anxiety and anxiety can be managed or cured. It can. We've come a long way.  Good luck to you with this. I hope you are soon back to you regular schedule of working out. Oh, and by the way, very fit people often do have unusually slow heart rates, especially at night (we are mostly all much slower when sleeping anyway). Even that was actually \"normal.\"  Best to you. Please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your informative, helpful, and reassuring reply. It is difficult for people to understand how anxiety can make a person feel so 'stuck' and fearful as to produce these kinds of symptoms. Which is why I have also had a hard time accepting this. Thank you for helping me accept this (a bit more) as being the root cause. I have been exercising more regularly and am up to jogging around 3 to 4 miles again along with other kinds of exercise on the other days.  I did have a follow up question which I am hesitant to ask given my health and heart worry prone mind. But I will ask anyway believing that there are no 'dumb' questions when it comes to one's health. Could something like Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy been missed given the tests and workup that I have received? I understand that an echo is most used to determine something like this. Is it possible though that an echo (along with the other tests I have taken) could have not shown this (for example if this were in the early stages, might it be missed by a cardiologist)? The reason I am asking is because some of my symptoms, especially in regards to exercise seem to have some connection to this condition. I also understand that this is not uncommon in athletes and people who are fit. While I am no athlete and currently not very fit, I have enjoyed exercise regularly and pretty intensively in the past and also been pretty fit. I wonder if my shortness of breath (which has been attributed to slight asthma) is more in line with HCM. For example, I will sometimes feel short of breath after eating too much or after going up a flight of stairs (along with palpitations). However, when I go through an actual exercise routine, I don't notice this as much. I also notice when I exercise that the beginning stages seem to be more difficult when it comes to my breathing. (I have a harder time taking in a deep breath and experience more 'irritation' in my lungs - feels like I felt when I was younger playing outside on a smoggy day (live in Los Angeles) and taking a deep breath would 'hurt'.) I also notice while I am cooling down that I feel more anxious. Sometimes my heartbeat feels like it is skipping. I also have that feeling of lightheadedness, slight dizziness sometimes during but also after my workout. Nothing serious has ever happened - I haven't fainted or fallen but there are times when I don't feel right. (I also remember one occasion a few years ago before I had taken any tests, when after playing some intensely competitive basketball for a good hour with minimal breaks, I felt pretty strong palpitations and some of that 'skipped' beat sensation afterwards for what seemed to be a good 20-30 minutes afterwards. I didn't worry to the extent I do now, but as I look back on that, I wonder if that was a first sign of something being wrong (I didn't have other symptoms like chest pain or dizziness though)). I do believe this can all be related to my anxiety and particulary my heart fears. And while I am more prone to being more sensitive and aware of everything I am feeling, what if I am just being more sensitive to an actual heart condition that is affecting me? Anyways, I wanted to know if this is something I should be concerned with and I should pursue further with a cardiologist. Thank you for your understanding in this and for all the good things this forum provides.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I can relate to this. I've been similar to you for 2 years now - and how you explain your heart \"skips\" are similar to what I experience. I often can feel one coming, odd as that seems.  I also suffer chest pain, although 5 EKGs have shown normal. I was diagnosed with Tietze's Syndrome last year, but I often find this difficult to agree with as anti inflamatories often do not work. I find it difficult to find the right kind of exercise, and am getting to the stage where if I don't start soon, the after effects I feel will not be my body - more the fact that I've become so unfit.  Does your chest pain \"move\" ? Does it sometimes feel like a pulling, or as if someone invisible is pull chest hair ? I can usually locate the source of the pain, and it does hurt when I touch it the source.   I'm 38 and with no history and the 5 tests mentioned above, Doctors don't really want to know and assume it's anxiety.   Do you feel similar?\n\n",

    "title": "Alternative drug to Nitro-glycerin?",
    "content": "Back in 1999 my husband had a cerebral haemorrhage. He made a good recovery albeit slowly but is fit, perfect weight and eats a very healthy diet. For several years he has suffered with a tight, stretching feeling in the heart/chest area and has been to emergency to be checked out. They've never found anything conclusive except 'angina.' He was prescribed nitro-glycerin and took one tablet as necessary for two days. On the third day he had a very bad reaction and I had to call an ambulance. It was thought that his blood pressure fell too quickly.  They referred him to a cardiologist. The cardiologist did an utrascan, ECG and also a stress test and seemingly as was good. The cardiologist prescribed some nitro-glycerin patches but after only 30 mins my husband started to feel unwell and by 6pm his blood pressure was 90/50...so the cardiologist said he was never to use that drug. Then he referred him for an angiogram and they said that out of the three arteries, two were 100% open but the third was only 20% open. This did not need a stent because it was right at the end of the left ventricle and too fragile. The blockage would be treated with medication. The cardiologist assured my husband that this blockage was nothing to be concerned about, was not dangerous as long as he kept his cholesterol under control. He agreed that he was already taking sufficient medication and there was nothing new to prescribe. My husband asked what he could take to relieve the angina pain...he said there was only nitro-glycerin....which of course he can't take.  My question is...is there an alternative drug to nitro- glycerin?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- Many people find nitroglygerine or related substances too difficult to tolerate (severe headaches, \"bottoming out\" of blood pressure, etc.) and while there is nothing quite like nitro for knocking down an episode of angina, there are other medications which may make it a lot less of a problem, especially in someone like your husband, whose overall condition is stable and relatively good, but who has some distant narrowing which won't likely cause serious problems but still can cause some severe discomfort (and the attendant anxiety). There is a class of drug called calcium channel blockers, for instance, which may help, especially if the angina he is feeling is due to spasm of the distant segment of the affected artery, which is something that often happens in cases like this. It could be worth a trial, although these drugs, too, can sometimes cause uncomfortably low blood pressure. The trick is to start the dose quite low and work with the lowest dose that's effective but still doesn't cause the unpleasant side effects. I think it might well be worth a shot.   I do hope this is helpful. Good luck to you both. Please follow up with  us here with any further questions or concerns you may have.\n\n",

It sounds as though you're going to have to be more assertive with the doctors there, as \"You worry too much about your health\" is not an acceptable alternative to managing a person's health issues. You may be stuck however, because there can be a cultural \"walk it off\" attitude. The Norvasc may well need a simple adjustment. If the current doctor persists in his cavalier attitude you may well have to find someone else to manage your husband's care. Good luck with that.\n\n",

    "content": "The pains could certainly be anxiety-related, especially when one considers the random nature and especially the locations. The fact they are sharp as opposed to dull and aching or squeezing, and the fact they appear in varying locations all suggest either anxiety (which would certainly be understandabl) or possible a chest wall muscle inflammation problem. They don't sound at all like heart -related pains. However, your doctor still needs to remember just because a patient may be anxious this doesn't mean he cannot also be sick. Even though this doesn't sound heart-related it does warrant some attention. Doctors often begin to assume every complaint arises from what they believe to be anxiety. They may sometimes be right, but they may also equally often be wrong, especially if the don't check.   Again, I don't think this is heart related, but it does deserve further attention to rule out other, simpler causes that could help you feel better and perhaps even reduce your level of anxiety. This would all be to the good. I'd mention the fact to your doctor if I were you.  Hope this helps. Good luck to you and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: tachycardia post ASD closure",
    "content": "Hello -- I just realized I just replied to a separate post from you regarding the pains, and I refer you to that for the answer to that part. I would also ask that in future you try and keep your questions regarding a given issue to a single post so we can better keep track of you. Now then: You mention having had an attack of tachycardia, but you do not state the heart rate during this episode. Some tachycardias are normal variations. Knowing the rate is important. The fact you had a number of PACs during a 24 hour period is vaguely suggestive of an irritable focus in the atria, where your repair was done, and this could, possibly, result in some benign but annoying supraventricular tachycardia. While your EKG and echo were normal, an event monitor or Holter monitor might be of more help in identifying the rate and extent (if it ever happens again) of such an episode. Meanwhile, if beta blocker medication is offered it is worth considering, although I wouldn't recommend this simply on the basis of some PACs occurring during a 24 hour period. If there is additional tachycardia it might be reduced or eliminated by use of beta blockers, but again an actual diagnosis really should be reached first. A portable monitoring device would be a big help in sorting this out.  Good luck to you with this. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Spasms below left breast and underneath ribs",
    "content": "Hi there -- What you describe doesn't sound at all like heart pain, but does, indeed, sound like voluntary muscle spasms. The heart, oddly enough, is not on the left side as commonly thought, but is in the center of the chest, beneath the breast bone. Pains in the left chest, especially in or below the breast, are almost never heart related. They also would last a good bit longer than what you describe. This sounds very much like muscle spasm, though it also could be constochondritis (inflammation of the cartilege between the ribs). This complaint is more often seen in women for some reason, whether muscular or due to inflamed connective tissue. If it can be determined which it is it can be treated medically, with antispasmodics or muscle relaxants if it is spasm (and also possibly some postural adjustment); if it is costochondritis (also known as Tietz's syndrome) it is treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as Advil or Aleve. Since it is of such brief duration it does sound more like spasm, and in either case the fact that repositioning or changing posture helps relieve it strongly suggests a musculoskeletal origin. You might ask your doctor if you can be given any stretching exercises for the upper body, which sometimes can help relieve this sort of problem. If not, medication to relieve the inflammation or spasm would be appropriate.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

BP consistenlty below 120/80 and heart rate on average of 78 BPM. Sometimes my BP machine shows the irregular heartbeat symbol. I also have occasional palitations and my heart rate goes from 85-103 BPM. Also, for the past two months I have had occasionaly sharp pains mostly on the left side of the chest but sometimes on the right. I also experience a dull ache all over the chest and what feels like a vibration just to the left of my breastbone. It also hurts to lie on my left side - I have sharp pain under my armpit area and around the heart area. When I reposition the pain goes away. There is no shortness of breath and no pain with exertion. I have had an ECG and chest x-ray and they were normal. My blood work (TSH, CBC, liver, kidney, C-reactive protein) was normal as well. My doctor thinks its stress or costochondritis but I am worried its my heart. Could it be that or should I ask to see a cardiologist? Thank you...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- Occasional palpitations are completely normal in both the diseased and healthy population. We all get them. Sometimes they pass unnoticed for a long time only to suddenly become noticeable, but they are extremely common and in themselves neither diagnostic nor prognostic or anything.  Which brings us to the chest discomfort. The fact the pains are not central and visceral, the fact they are often sharp, and especially the fact they can be relieved by repositioning all argue against heart-related problems, palpitations completely aside. I think your doctor is correct about costochondritis and this will often respond nicey to over the counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as Aleve or its generic naproxyn. This can be a chronic problem in some people, but the treatment is almost always the same: NSAIDs and repositioning.   In short no, I don't think anything you've described here fits any heart-related profile at all. Hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "severe pain under left breast with some swelling",
    "content": "I am 48 year old female, the pain started this afternoon it is very strong . On a scale 1-10 its a 10.  It's located directly under my left breast at about the third rib.   I can cover it with the palm of my hand. It occurs when I cough, sneeze, burp, inhale, or exhale deeply. It also occurs if I move my left arm far to the side or lift or push with my left arm. It occurs if I try to bend over to pick something up from the floor. I cannot bend over the pain is to bad, I have to squat . There is also some swelling or maybe fluid in the same location as the pain, again I can cover with my palm, it is about 2 inches wide and 3 long soft and kinda smooshy when pressed against. At first it felt like a pulled muscle, but  I did not feel the sudden pain or tight stretched feeling you get when you pull a muscle nor did I do anything to have done so. Having worked manual labor involving lifting and carrying up to 100 lbs sometimes more for over 30 years I have pulled muscles before and usually worked through it. I have started taking ibuprofen, hoping it is some kind of inflamation. I would really like to know if this could be the case or if it could be something else. I need to figure it out as I cannot inhale to take my spiriva.\n\n",

    "content": "While the pain could well be caused by costochondritis (an imflamation of the cartilege between the ribs), the severity of the pain and the limitation it causes, along with this very odd swelling over the site warrants evaluation by a doctor urgently. You have to be able to take your Spiriva anyway, and you can't function well as things are. I wouldn't hazard a guess beyond possibly a very bad case of costochondritis, but the swelling has me both puzzled and a little concerned. You should have this looked at right away.

    "content": "Dear Doctors,  I am a 27 yr old male.  6'3\" 300 Pounds.  My family has no history of Cardiovascular Disease.  I quit smoking 125 days ago, I do not drink. I am currently Dieting at 1500 calories a day.  I have gained 75 pounds in 1 year since the onset of symptoms.  My Thyroid Panel came back at low normal at 5.5  Complete Cardiac Workup was done in May of 2004 (Nuclear Stress Test - Echocardiogram) All Normal EKG's done in May 2005, August 2005 - All Normal Upper GI Barium Swallow Done in Nov 2005 - Mild Duodenitis  Blood Pressure shows High in Docotors office but cuff size is too small. At home with Large Cuff size blood pressure is between 118/58 and 122/84. At Dr's Office it is between 130/90 and 144/98. Dr. has since put me on Benicar 20mg 1 time a day.  Now for the symptoms In February 2005 I carried my guitar, amplifier and a bowling ball from the street to my apt (approx 1/2 mile).  I had to strain a great deal to carry them and did press up against my ribs awkwardly to hold the items up while unlocking gates and doors.  I was extremely short of breath like I had just ran 10 miles but had little chest discomfort.  Later that night (approx 4 hours) I developed an intense pain in my chest that radiated to my left arm. And I thought I was having a heart attack.  I did not go to the ER as my last ER visit cost me 20K as I did not have insurance and I still did not have insurance.  Instead I took some aspirin and some left over valium  as I was panicking.  The next day I ached in my left side from the region of my colon all the way to my chest with pain centering on the center of my chest. and my Thorasic Spine region.  THis pain comes and goes about 4 days a week but seems to come more when I am sitting for long periods of time (Ie at work). It also feels as though I am having trouble breathing but I am not. Some nights I have to take a valium just so i can relax enough to go to sleep(about once a night). Also the valium seems to also lessen the pain.  Dr's have guessed that I have reflux and esophogeal spasms and treated me with protonix - this has not worked and I doubt that Esophogeal symptoms would be so insidious.  My current Dr. Believes I have Costochondroitis.  But I question that as it has been 1 yr..  Please help I am scared as I havent got a real diagnosis and my Dr. doesnt seem worried or care.. He just through naproxen at me (500 mg BID) and it has had no effect at all. the pain is slightly different but still there.  I am currently no longer on protonix - as my current Dr. Said my problem was muskuloskeletal all though he did no tests to determine this.  My BP seems to be ok. I have had numerous Cardiac Tests, Gastric Tests, but still no answers.  Thank you in advance for any help.\n\n",

    "content": "For several months now, maybe as long as a year, off and on, I have been experiencing what I can only described as a missed heart beat in the evening.  I thought it was mearly heart burn, perhaps GERD -- an esophogeal spasm -- because until last night I wasn't able to detect any particular change in my heart beat when one of the spasms occured.  However, last night, while in bed, I was having a particularly significant time of this, and had my finger to my neck and noticed very clearly that my normal \"beat beat beat\" pulse was broken up in a \"beat beat .....  BEAT beat beat\" sort of rhythm (if that makes any sense... hard to describe in plain text) with the heavy spasm feeling being the larger then usual \"catchup\" beat if you will.  There is no pain, although sometimes I do feel heartburn-like symptoms in the middle of my chest or lower left area around the solar plexis area.  When the spasm (miss beat) occurs, it sometimes takes my breath away and induces a light cough (not a fit, just one or two very light coughs).  Recently I had a severe reaction to an accidental ingestion of shrimp (I have an allergy to iodine) -- this was only a month or two ago -- and my heartbeat and blood pressure was excellent (don't remember what it was, but the nurse said it was very good when I asked since I didn't know what the numbers actually meant...)  After last night, I intend to seek medical attention, but in searching online I came across this forum and thought I'd ask.  Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Missed heart beat",
    "content": "Hello -- I think I can help here. What you describe (an actually very good description) is a premature heartbeat, either premature ventricular contraction (PVC) or premature atrial contraction (PAC). The difference is one originates in the atria, the top two chambers of the heart; the other (PVC) originates in the lower chambers. They can feel very similar otherwise. They are extremely common, more so among anxious people, but occur normally in the healthy population as well (of course) as those with some variety of heart disease. They are of no diagnostic nor prognostic significance, but can be very disturbing. Your description is perfect. The next regular heartbeat comes a little early and, in the case of PVCs, there is a compensatory pause so the next beat comes right when it would have normally. Sometimes this makes for a harder subsequent beat, or sometimes the premature beat feels like the more forceful one, depending on the timing. PACs do much the same thing, but the pause afterward is not precisely compensatory and can be shorter or longer. Still no big deal. The sense of having one's breath taken away and the occasional singular cough are caused when one of these beats occurs out of synchrony with the opening and closing of the valves, particularly the tricuspid (pulmonary) valve. Since the blood bound for the lungs has no place else to go, it backs up in the jugular (especially on the right side) and the beat is more forceful, may be felt in the neck and sometimes momentarily seems to snatch the breath. It is only momentary however. These premature beats, especially PVCs, happen quite often when trying to fall asleep, as they are more likely to slip in when the heart is slowing, which it does as we become sleepy or relaxed -- or after exercise, during cooldown/slowdown. They are more readily felt when lying on one's left side and sometimes this can even provoke them, since in some people it brings the apex of the heart into contact with the chest wall, and the heart does not like to to \"touched.\"   All of this is merely by way of explanation of something more common -- and less significant -- than sneezing or hiccups. We all have them. Some of us notice every one, others never feel them. Anxiety over them, ironically, will cause them to become more frequent, so the better one is able to overlook them, the less frequent they may actually become.   It's as simple as that!   Hope this helps. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I do not know if you had the iron defeciency prior to the heart attack. Chronic iron is known to cause cadiomyopathy (iron defeciency cardiomyopathy). Iron deficiency reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, thus, reducing the 'oxygen delivery'(to the tissues - including the heart). It is likely that you have had iron deficiency for quite some time.It must be corrected as it may worsen one's prognosis during a myocardial infarction. The pain that you are referring to(as you suspect) is not typical of pleural pain.Pain arising from the pericardium (due to pericarditis) also usually increases on deep breathing, but can also be dull and steady, resembling the chest pain in an acute MI.Also, it may increase the CRP(especially myopericarditis).Dressler syndrome(Also called postmyocardial infarction syndrome) is a very likely possibility and must be excluded.

    "content": "Hello, for the past few months I have been having these weird sensations where I will feel my hearth \"thump and then there is like a pause before it starts beating again. And just in general I'm having heart palpitations quite frequently, I can feel my heart beat most of the time.   There are other symptoms too unrelated to the heart, I constantly am having a churning stomach and there are always very loud noises coming from all over my abdomen. Also, my breath has been very bad and there is a gurgling sound in my throat/espophogus from time to time. It's kind of like the feeling you get right before you vomit, but I'm not vomiting, I'm just getting that feeling in my throat.   I should mention that for whatever reason the heart sensations, stomach noises, and throat esophogus gurgling are definitely worst when I am laying down, either on my stomach or my back. I have a very difficult time sleeping since this has began.   I'm a 25 year old male, and I should mention I have battled anxiety problems in the past. In fact, just 2 years ago I had pretty much every possible test run on me to rule things out before the doc determined it was anxiety. Had an EKG and wore a holter monitor and both came back normal, in fact, the doc said that my heart looked \"fantastic.\" I'm just really struggling to determine if this latest series of events is in fact more anxiety or if there is actually something to all this.   Again, biggest symptoms are heart palpitations, abdominal gurgling/noises, regurgitation feeling and bad breath, difficulty sleeping. Someone told me to get my thyroid checked, any possibility that's what it is?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Thump then a skipped beat?",
    "content": "Hi -- This is simpler than it will seem before I'm finished explaining. See, the symptoms are quite real, but they not only can be caused by anxiety, once they start they can aggravate anxiety, which in turn aggravates more premature beats. That's the frustrating part, because the more they happen the more they happen unless the anxious person learns to ratchet down the anxiety an overlook (I won't say \"ignore\") the palpitations.  What happens -- and is perfectly normal and common in otherwise healthy people but especially in anxious people -- is a heartbeat will be triggered by an irritable spot somewhere in the heart other than the normal sinus pacemaking site (where all normal beats originate, or at least that's the plan). The early beat is then followed by a pause, because the heart was already going to beat, but the ectopic beat, um, beat it to it. So it waits a second, usually. If the ectopic beat comes from the lower part of the heart (ventricles) the pause is exactly long enough so the next sinus beat occurs right when it should and the overall rhythm isn't changed. If it comes from the upper chambers the pause may be a little shorter or longer. Either way it's harmless, normal, common, but feels really weird. Some lucky people are totally unaware of this happening. Others feel it but pay it no mind. Anxious people feel them, wonder what that was, become a little more anxious, and so release a little more adrenaline, which may cause even more of them. It still doesn't matter except that then a cycle of anticipation, increased anxiety, more \"skipped\" (actually early) beats, causing more anxiety, til the person is miserable and worried.   No need to be. This is harmless, normal and common.   Now then: You're also having some extra actvitity going on in your stomach. This can also be caused by anxiety, but could be some other minor GI thing. The problem is whichever the case, this peristaltic stomach action is activated by the vagus nerve, which also slows the heart rate. Vagal stimulation (digestion, stomach upset, fullness, etc.) often will trigger premature heartbeats. Again, this is normal, but when the stomach is upset or overactive the person may notice more premature beats. It follows, but unless you have this particular medical knowlege you're not likely to realize this. Also it sounds like you may have some gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) going along with whatever else is happening in your GI tract. It could be due to anxiety or not. Doesn't matter, when stomach contents moves up into the esophagus, there's one more thing tickling the heart (which is physically right next door to the esophagus), so more premature beats. It all goes together.   Getting the stomach settled might help reduce the number of premature beats, but all the symptoms could be due to anxiety as the first cause. The stomach issues should be explored because if that's at the bottom of all this, curing that will make everything else better. However, if anxiety came first and is causing the other stuff, you'll need to address that directly.The best way to do that (in my humble opinion) is to find someone who practices cogntive behavioral therapy (CBT), a self-limited form of interactive psychotherapy with \"homework\", which is known to be very effective in altering primal behavior and helping people control anxiety (and sometimes depression as well). It's worth a look, at least if all the GI things are corrected and the \"skippped\" beats and anxiety persist. Those beats will occasionally happen anyway, but if you're no longer anxious you may be unaware of them, so they wouldn't be an issue anymore. They're quite \"real\" (just because a symptom is caused by anxiety doesn't make it imaginary), they just don't really matter, except in terms of your perception of them.   I hope this helps. Please feel free to follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much. If nothing else this will put my mind at ease. The stomach issues are what happened first, then the heart palps followed. I always figured that the heart issues were from my anxiety, and you have further confirmed this.   As far as the stomach issues go, I have been to the doctor and he checked me out. He believes I'm suffering from either GERD, Hiatal Hernia or possibly an H Pylori infection, although he didn't seem to think there was much chance of it being the H Pylori. I'm on prescription meds for the reflux right now and they seem to be helping somewhat. I'm to check back with him in about a month to let him know if the meds are helping or if we need to explore other options.  The anxiety has definitely made this situation worse for sure. It's truly amazing the real physical symptoms anxiety can cause a person. I'd rather be ill with a virus any day than battle anxiety caused physical symptoms, they are a nightmare.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- The few people I've encountered who've had ruptured chordae tendonae weren't aware anything specific had happened. They did all experience symptoms, ranging from shortness of breath to lightheadedness to simple fatigue, but none were aware something had mechanically gone haywire. I also find this surprising, or at least I did the first time. It usually comes apart at the far end, where connnected to the papillary muscle, so flailing is definitely the right descriptor, but since the heart muscle has minimal sensory receptors (surprised? Me too) it may not \"feel\" this even though there is something \"loose\" in there.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as necessary.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- Whether or not your heart's size will return to normal or not depends entirely upon how it got enlarged. If it's dilated (which would seem most likely) it could very well improve over time, assuming the underlying cause is corrected, and that presumptively is the sepsis you were suffering. If, however, you already had an enlarged heart it is less likely to correct due to a lack of underlying cause, and then would have to be managed emperically based on symptoms, since thickening of the muscle is usually of unknown cause, whereas dilated cardiomyopathy can be due to systemic illness such as sepsis (and I do suspect this is the cause). If your overall health is restored there is at least an even chance of partial to complete correction of the problem.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.

    "title": "Re: marked cardiomegaly and palpitations.",
    "content": "You're very welcome.  Your echocardiogram report is interesting and my assumption was wrong concerning the cardiomegaly. Your left ventricle is thickened, not dilated. In some ways this is preferable, as it may be more amenable to medical treatment. Your left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is still within normal limits, but has dropped from the last reading. This in itself would not be remarkable, as often the estimated LVEF can vary a good deal within normal limits. However, taken in the context of other findings this becomes a matter of some concern. There are abnormalities, including the thickened left ventricle, which is probably the reason for the drop in EF. You have a native bicuspid aortic valve with some mild stenosis. This has been present since birth, but the mild stenosis may be new. Mild is still mild, however. Your left atrium is enlarged somewhat, a very common and unremarkable finding. The impaired LV relaxation would correlate with the thickening of the wall, and does not as yet affect filling pressure. Things appear to be functioning okay so far, with something which may be a fixed or perhaps a progressive nature going on with the left ventricle.   Mild pulmonary hypertension would normally be a concern, at least in terms of what it could portend, but since you have this thickened LV, it is probably secondary to that. You appear to have some congestive heart failure based on your remarks regarding swelling in both lower extremities, although this could also be a residual effect of sepsis. However, the BNP is extremely high, which normally would suggest a very severe degree of congestive heart failure, which does not appear to be the case. I have to wonder if this was a lab error or some other freakish result. Your symptoms so far are not consistent with such a high BNP value.   The palpitations may be more frequent because of the thickened LV, but they are so common even in the healthy population this can't be used as much of a yardstick for the severity of the condition.   Both LV hypertrophy and congestive heart failure are often treated, at least in part, with beta blocker drugs. This is a conservative approach, but your overall clinical picture (excepting the very high BNP) suggests mild CHF, which may well correct on its own as you recover from the residual effects of sepsis and its treatment. While a thickened LV may sometimes return to a more normal dimension on its own, it is less likely, and usually will require some watching and probably some medical therapy, perhaps starting with a trial of a  beta blocker.   So far you seem to be doing pretty well. I'd want to have the BNP done over, since it seems inconsistent with the rest of the clinical picture. Otherwise this will just need to be watched over time, and of course any new or worsening symptoms reported to your doctor at once. So far, not too bad, though.\n\n",

I definitely understand your desire to limit the number of pills taken, but given the numbers game and the fact these two drugs do two different things (both important) I'd just accept the two-pill solution. It's well worth it, if it works.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: High CRP/chest pain",
    "content": "Hi there -- The character of your pain is most important right now, and if you could describe it for me it would be a big help. The CRP is high -- not extremely high, but what would be marked \"high\" on your lab report. Generally it is (1) or lower. When it's at 10 or above it indicates an active inflammatory process somewhere in the body, and of course any elevation can be due to an active inflammation almost anywhere. It could be a chronic status or a transient one. When there is chronic inflammation anywhere there is something of an increase in risk of heart disease, although the exact significance is still somewhat controversial. The short-term issue is the pain, and that's mainly because of the prior MI.   Classic \"textbook\" chest pain is always a matter of concern, but in young women it is often very atypical. Your pain doesn't sound, on the face of it, much like pleurisy, though. It's good the enzymes and EKG were negative, but this only means you haven't sustained another MI. It could mean something is going on -- or not. The best thing at this point would be for you to have a thallium scan stress test, unless of course a non-cardiac cause of the pain is discovered first. Also, if the pain doesn't occur with exertion it is less likely heart-related. Still, with your history, caution is warranted.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.

    "title": "Re: Chest and Heart pains after Flail Chest",
    "content": "Hi there -- Since the chest x-rays came back normal there's probably nothing serious going on. If you had some fluid buildup around the heart that would show, at least if it were significant, and that can sometimes cause sharp chest pains that don't reflect actual heart damage. The injury to your heart was probably cardiac contusion, that is bruising of the heart muscle, which is often seen with flail chest and sometimes can cause that fluid buildup (pericarditis). It seems not to be the case, however.   You did sustain a pretty severe and widespread chest trauma, and having had so many supporting structures fractured (mostly ribs) it's hardly surprising you'd develop some later pain. My question is this: does this pain get worse in breathing in? And does it hurt more if you move your body certain ways? If so, it is probably just residual chest wall pain and not serious. If taking in a deep breath causes sharp pain up into the shoulder area, you could still have some pericarditis or pleurisy from the initial injury. Luckily these are not serious conditions as a rule, and often respond well to simple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. If this continues I'd ask the doctor if it would be okay to try something like naproxyn or ibuprofin to help relieve the pain. If you do and it works, this is definitely just musculoskeltal residual pain and will eventually go away.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- Assuming you haven't taken it anymore since writing, you should have been out of the woods within 2-12 hours afterward. While 135 beats per minute isn't dangerous in itself, it is the potential for other things to happen that makes amphetamines extremely dangerous to some people and useful to only a few. I hope this was a prescribed medication but usually it's been \"acquired\" and tried, often with unpleasant and sometimes very bad results. If this is the worst that happened you did well. Just don't -- do not -- take it again. Vyvanase is a very potent stimulant with an effect not dissimilar to cocaine. These central nervous system stimulants can (repeat, can) be very dangerous. While it's unpleasant to have your heart going that fast at rest, it's not, by itself, dangerous. It does illustrate the power of this drug over the heart however, and it's potentially really, really dangerous. Even when prescribed for children with ADHD they need to be monitored and watched closely for potential adverse events. Please write us back and let us know how things turned out. The accelerated heart rate alone won't do any damage, but let it be a graphic reminder this is not a fun drug.   Hope everything is okay. Please follow up with us here and update us.

    "content": "Hi there,  I am a 25 year old female, nursing student, can't believe I'm looking for some online advice but I think stress is getting the best of me these days! I have a history of difficulty with anxiety over the past few years, but I don't wish to take medications. I usually manage with diet and exercise, although haven't had much time to do that lately either.  My question is this: over the past few days, I have been feeling an almost constant \"fluttering\" sensation in my chest - don't know whether I'd call it a \"palpitation\", but when it happens I become even more anxious. When it happens I palpate my own pulse and it usually doesn't feel very irregular (I generally have sinus arrhythmia - faster when I breathe in and slower when I breathe out). I'm usually pretty active: I play ice hockey, do aerobics, and I even ran a half marathon earlier this year. Today I thought I'd go for a run (haven't been for a bit) and when I did I got some chest pain, more to the left side of my chest, a bit more sharp in nature, that went away as soon as I stopped running and started walking. This in turn made me more anxious, thus causing me to have more palpitations this evening. I have seen my physician about this before: had a 10-second EKG and couple of times and some blood work which was all normal. Is this all in my head and/or related to anxiety? I have had a history of this happening before and then going away for months at a time and revisiting when I am particularly stressed. It is interfering incredibly with my quality of life (doesn't help that Nursing school is turning me and all my friends into giant hypochondriacs either). No family history of heart disease, take only birth control pills. Ex-smoker, don't drink regularly. I have also been feeling quite fatigued and dizzy lately. Please provide any insight you can. Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Palpitations - When are they more than stress?",
    "content": "Hi there -- Welcome to Nursing School Syndrome. You already knew that though, didn't you? It's natural to become more aware of (and concerned about) things that formerly would have escaped attention. Anxiety is very common among nursing students and interns. This doesn't mean your complaint isn't a real thing, and as it happens, it is extremely common in the healthy population. Nearly everyone has some palpitation sometimes, and some people have them a lot. They can be due to anxiety but they can also cause anxiety. Either way anxiety only increases their frequency, which can create a cycle.   You describe the sensation as \"fluttering\" and many people do preceive it this way. The question then  becomes: Was that a flurry of activity or just the way a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) feels to you? It's really not much of a difference unless fluttering palpitations are sustained for minutes to hours without any break, in which case it could suggest supraventricular tachycardia, which is still not dangerous in a healthy young person, but can be extremely distracting and is generally better eliminated (which usually is pretty simple). Chances are, however ,that as a student you keep some odd hours, feel more stress than before you were in nursing school, and worry over more things than you did before. You also may have developed reliance on caffeine, which only provokes more PVCs (and premature atrial contractions or PACs also). Neither are dangerous, and neither are diagnostic nor prognostic of anything. They can be distracting, annoying, scary, and can produce or increase pre-existing levels of anxiety, so it's good to learn to ignore or eliminate them. If they become extremely frequent and unnerving it is possible to reduce the frequency and force of them by means of beta blocker medication, but this is a last resort, because the symptom is harmless and beta blockers can have annoying side effects. It's just an ace in the hole if the problem becomes more than can be managed through usual means.   As a student you may need to rely on caffeine, and as a nurse you'll likely find it necessary to function. I've learned to accept that it will cause more palpitations than I might otherwise feel, and accept that tradeoff. I've had a lot of time to get used to palpitations and to thoroughly understand the lack of importance of them. It's much easier to say than do, however.   My main intention here is to assure you that a) this is not all in your head and b) to reassure you it is also not in any way a danger to you.   If you have any lightheadedness in direct relation to the \"fluttering\" sensations you could be having bursts of SVT, which are also extremely common. If they are not sustained they are generally not treated, but it helps to know if that's what's happening, so if this becomes really annoying and distracting you could certainly ask for either a 24 hour Holter monitor to try and catch the errant beats, or, better yet, an event monitor, which you can carry til you know you've caught the precise thing that's been bothering you, transmit it by telephone, and have it read by a tech. This should only be done, though, if you are really being made crazy by the symptoms. Being in school is not time for crazymaking stuff, so I offer that as a possible way to help reassure, especially since you did mention some fatigue and dizziness. This is probably  a separate issue, and the pain you describe sounds like classic \"stitch\" pain often experienced by runners, and doesn't resemble heart pain at all.  I hope all this is helpful to you. Please follow up here as needed. Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: pain under arm, upper back",
    "content": "Hello -- What you describe doesn't sound as though it is heart-related, but I'm not certain where you guess your heart to be located and a lot of people mistakenly believe it is on the left side of the chest, near or just below the breast. It's actually in the center of the chest. The pain you describe also sounds peculiar in that it seems to start in the back, move down your arm, then come back toward the heart, which is a very retrograde (backward) pathway for heart pain.   While you are technically somewhat overweight you are also young and fairly fit, not morbidly obese, so these aren't the most urgent concerns (although the body mass index probably should be lower, and you are working on the weight). The primary concern with your weight is the fact there is a family history of diabetes, and weight control (along with exercise and diet) is essential to avoiding development of this problem later on in life.  The pains you're having sound like they may be postural in nature, possibly due to your work and repetitive motion or posture at the work station. This often can lead to a condtion known as thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) which often can be relieved by correction of posture. The fact the problem occurs when lying down also suggests this may be the cause.  Because there is some question as to the actual location of the pain (and your estimation of the location of your heart) it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to have a complete baseline physical with 12-lead EKG, which could set your mind at ease about any possible heart problems and perhaps gather at the same time some good advice as to possible orthopedic/nerve causes of this pain.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Why am I feeling chest pain after palpitations stopped?",
    "content": "I am male, 24 and 151lbs. I have been having heart problems since last Thursday.  It all started on Thursday morning, when I was sitting by the computer.  My heart suddenly started beating very rapidly, as fast as 150-200 beats per minute.  It lasted 30-60 seconds.  I then felt palpitations 2 more times before noon while I was sitting around and then again just after I started walking a moderate pace.  These episodes were shorter in duration and didn\u2019t seem to be as strong.  I didn\u2019t feel it again until the following day at noon and then again a few hours after that.  That was the last time I felt any palpations.    I decided to go a doctor on Saturday morning.  I don\u2019t take any medication, drink alcohol, smoke or even drink caffeine, so he ruled of those common causes.  However, stress may have been a contributing factor.  I do recall feeling worried and anxious prior to my first episode, but that\u2019s not typically what I would call stressed out.  Anyway, he took a blood test to mainly check for thyroid problems and an EKG.  Both tests came back normal.  My blood pressure was also normal.  He suspected I had PSVT, but to be sure, he directed me to wear a holter monitor for 48 hours.  As I mentioned, during that period, I didn\u2019t experience any more palpitations.  Instead however, I began feeling chest pain in the heart.   I would occasionally feel this mild to moderate discomfort aching feeling when I would be relaxing.  I didn\u2019t feel this sensation while I had palpitations, or even on the same day.  Also, I don\u2019t know if it related but I also rode my bike, and afterwards I felt dizzy for about 5 minutes.  On Monday, I went back to the doctor to have the monitor removed.  I should get the results by the end of this week.  I felt pretty good for the rest of the day, despite the occasional mild discomfort I talked about earlier.  However, when I went for a short walk on Tuesday morning, the pain seemed to be a little more intense.  It sort of felt like if I had walked or ran a long distance, especially in the cold, and I would begin to feel discomfort in my heart or lungs.  I would consider myself in pretty good shape.  To wrap this up, I told my doctor about my chest pain and dizziness when I went in on Monday, but he didn\u2019t seem to be too concerned.  It just seems strange how the palpitations seemed to suddenly stop and instead I have been feeling a mild to moderate chest pain.  Is this something to be immediately concerned about or should I wait to hear back about the results and then talk to him about it again.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- The palpitations you experienced were almost certainly supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and though they hadn't recurred at the time of your post, this can be very random, so could happen again. A Holter monitor is therefore not the ideal way to catch these. An event monitor (which can be kept for 30 days and the patient records any episode by pushing a button, then afterward transmitting the recorded event over the telephone to be interpreted). The pains are a whole other issue, possibly related, but of more concern, and need to be investigated simply because of the description of them and the close relation to the apparent SVT. What's most likely is mitral valve prolapse (MVP) which can cause both symptoms and is almost always a benign condition. Your relative youth argues against coronary artery disease, as does your low weight. On the other hand, people of slight build are much more often found to have MVP, so this could be ruled out or in very easily by means of an echocardiogram.   Assuming no further SVT episodes (which can be treated with medication or radio frequency ablation if too frequent), if the chest pains can be determined to be of no importance (MVP for instance) then there would be no further need for concern. However, your description of the pain does warrant a workup just to be sure nothing unusual is going on.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "You were right, the palpitations did reoccur, though only twice since the 10/30 and 10/31 episodes, once on 11/04 and the other on 11/08.  On both of these occasions, it only lasted about a second and felt more like an extra forced beat or 2, nothing that I would normally think much about - unlike earlier when it would beat rapidly for several seconds and up to almost a minute the first time it happened.  I am however feeling the same very brief pulsating sensation in other muscles of my body, including my buttocks, thighs, the sides of my ribs and upper arms.  This happens more often, nearly every day since 10/30 and sometimes several times a day, most often when I am lying down.   Mitral Valve Prolapse could be a possible diagnosis.  I\u2019ll talk to my doctor about it.  I did some research, and I match up with 3 or 4 of the 6 symptoms they listed.  Understandably, symptoms will vary from person to person and many people don\u2019t have symptoms have at all.  My symptoms include palpitations, chest pain, fatigue and possibly a little shortness of breath.   On a related note, although the doctor prescribed me a low dosage atenolol, I have not yet taken it, as I await a diagnosis.  Would this help the chest pain or for that matter, muscle pulsating?  Also, although as you said palpitations can be very random, I appear to be noticing a trend in relation to my diet.  If I eat relatively healthy with fruit, vegetables and whole grains, I feel pretty good, maybe not great because I still feel fatigue.  However, if I eat a meal high in sodium and saturated fat, (not including caffeine or chocolate, which as I understand can cause palpitations) the following day, I feel chest pain more often and may even have palpitations or something like a murmur.  It may be a coincidence but it\u2019s something I have noticed.    I\u2019ll let you know the results of my holter test reading, and what he may think of Mitral Valve Prolapse.  Thank you for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "Good to hear from you again. It seems you're not only doing better but also reasoning out some things remarkably well. For instance, the diet-palpitation connection is far from faulty. The healthier diet you mention contains many items that contain potassium, and low potassium (K) can certainly provoke not only palpitations but also muscle spasms. All muscle control is dependent upon K for it to work right, including one's heart. Some people have more trouble retaining a desireable level of K than others, which is especially problematic because too much is as bad as too little. Balance is key here.   Potassium loss (or simply needing a little more) and possibly MVP, together, could account for most of these symptoms. Either one could separately too. It might be useful to know what your level is. Some people who have difficulty metabolizing it properly require a supplement, but usually this can be corrected (safely) through a diet rich in potassium (fruits -- especially bananas, vegetables, raisins, nuts, etc.).   Beta blockers, in general, will reduce the frequency and perception of palpitations, and may also reduce, to some extent, muscle twitching. Common side effects (depending on which one is used) can be cold extremities, initial lethargy, a slower heart rate, lightheadedness (which usually corrects after a few weeks if it occurs) and lowered blood pressure. Atenolol seems to cause more of these in more people than, say, metaprolol, but there are enough different ones to choose from, and atenolol and metaprolol seem to be the two favorites of most doctors. It certainly can't hurt, and might just help. If the side effects are especially annoying you could wean yourself off over a week or two.   Do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "This problem has been ruling my life now for the last 4 months and is driving me mad.  I am a 29 year old female from the UK.  I have smoked for the last 12 years and quit earlier this year due to chest pain.  The pains appear anywhere within my chest.  It can be on either side of my chest at the front, down the centre or under my armpit and side of the rib cage.  The pain feels like its deep and is not a sharp pain but a dull ache as though someone is poking a finger really hard inside my chest.  Sometimes if its at the front of my chest it radiates into my breast or centre of my chest.  I also get the pain in what feels like my lungs.  It can be either side of my back.  I have had an ECG which came out normal, I have had a chest X-Ray, which came out normal.  I have had full blood works too which also showed as normal.  The pain is not worse with exercise but does tend to worsen throughout the day.  I do not do regular exercise though.  Very occasionally, I can feel my chest creaking down the centre which is strange but this does not happen often.  My doctors have related my problem to muscular pain and I have been taking ibuprofen and painkillers for the last 3 months which I was told would help.  It hasn't.  Its becoming so worrying now that 2 weeks ago I was taken to A&E as the chest pain induced my first ever panic attack.  I would really like some reassurance on this as it is ruining my life.  It is constantly on my mind and I worry that something has been missed.  The worry has turned me into a completely different person who is now miserable and constantly on edge.  Many thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  There is certainly something going on that needs to be addressed. It doesn't sound cardiac and tests you've had so far seem to bear that out. However, there are a few other things that could be ruled out with a more thorough exam that should include at least an echocardiogram to make certain there isn't any structural heart problem. I'd bet against that, but it's still worthy of attention, since no one knows for sure without looking first.   Assuming there's no structural heart disease, I'd put my money not on a muscular problem so much as an inflammatory process involving the cartilege between the ribs, costochondritis by name. While this usually will respond to anti-inflammatories, sometimes it requires steriods to do the job right. Again, though, the echo should be done first, since we wouldn't want you on a stronger pain med or steroids if you actually do have some (possibly quite innocent) structural problem such as mitral valve prolapse which can, sometimes, cause this sort of symptom, although why is unclear.   I hope this  is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Please keep us informed if you hear anything from your results.  Mr. Kenyon, we've communicated back and forth on this site before although it has been a while.  My symptoms are very similar to hers.  I, also, have had most of the same tests within the past 8 months or so including nuclear stress test, blood work including cholesterol, CXR, CT scan w/ contrast of the thoracic cavity, endoscopy for possible GERD, echocardiogram in December and they have all come back negative yet I still keep getting deep chest pains.  It has been ongoing for just about a year, early June 2008.  They (meaning the GP and the cardiologist) keep telling me it is costochondritis or muscular in nature.  Just recently, I was told to try Ibuprofen 800 mgs. per day x 3 times/day and it has been 2 weeks now and the pain has not improved.  The pain is felt in both sides of my chest, in my back, rib cage, occasionally migrating down the inside or outside of my left arm.  It does not seem to worsen during physical exertion as I try and run 3-5 miles a day usually 3-4 times a week. I will say that often times I can reproduce the pain or at least something similar by pressing in between the ribs in my chest.  It almost seems as if the pain originates from there.  Also, more often than not, I can press on the xyphoid bone in the middle of my chest and it is generally sore.  I'm at a total loss.  If you have any suggestions, I would be very appreciative.  Sincerely,  Rene'.\n\n",

I am no longer obessing over the chest pains or waiting for them to happen but they are still an every day occurence in my life.  I saw a doctor at the hospital last week who ordered another ECG and has booked me an appointment for a CT Scan and a 24 hour event monitor.  I have to say that she was the first doctor who I have seen that didn't dismiss my symptoms as stress or muscular which was a refreshing change!  She did say she had no idea though what I was experiencing so after the CT scan and monitor, she will consider an echocardiagram.  dcm8299 - I too have been able to produce a pain (only on 2 occasions) by pressing on the area above the pain.  The pain wasn't replicated but it was more of a shooting pain into my left arm and back.  I haven't been able to do this again though.  I am still hoping my problems are muscular but it will be reassuring to have the tests done and know that I am in no immediate danger!  I will update when I have had the tests and results back!\n\n",

I've had numerous test....2 EKG's an echo at rest and after stress test which all came back normal which is always a relief...but I'm still battling this pain after 2 months now.  My dr. still seems to think it's anxiety related.  Maybe it is maybe I've not been breathing right.  I've read people w/ anxiety tend to sigh more or not breath properly I've heard to take deep breaths thru your nose and it does seem to help for the first day in 2 months my chest has hardly hurt at all.  They say the breathing can make your muscles sore and tense up if your not doing it properly.  Try that and maybe that will help you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- While I very much doubt this is actually heart-related, I'm not going to blow that off as a possibility for now. First, though, I would very much like to know where you believe your heart is located, since you use it as your frame of reference and most people mistakenly believe the heart lies in the left chest, near or below the left breast, which is not the case. The heart is located directly in the center in the chest beneath the breastbone and more or less centered along the imaginary line between the nipples. If this is, in fact, the affected area, even if this should be heart-related discomfort (and still I find it unlikely for a lot of reasons) it would more likely be a structural problem rather than coronary artery disease.   That said, I see you have asthma in your family history. You may well have it also, as it often presents with symptoms such as you describe, more so lately for some reason, with chest tightness and shortness of breath being major descriptors rather than the classic wheezing. Unfortunately another possibility that announces itself this way can be anxiety, which while not a dangerous medical problem, can often wind up being a crippling emotional problem because it is so insidious, unpredictable and because the patient is so often unaware of the anxiety. Frequently anxious people absolutely have no clue they are anxious and will deny a problem in the area in which it precisely exists. This only complicates the diagnosis of whatever the real problem may be. It also could be a chest wall inflammation problem, musculoskeletal, and the symptoms also fit that very well. Heart pain, even with structural disease, is rarely random and spontaneous and never \"sharp\" or \"stabbing\" in nature. It does, however, last longer than a few seconds, so the fact this pain lasts a few minutes after onset does leave me with no choice but to suggest you at least have a resting 12-lead EKG as part of a general evaluation to determine just what's going on. If this comes out looking good and there are no unusual heart sounds found by the doctor, then simpler explanations (chest wall irritation, even anxiety) can be explored at a more relaxed pace.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- While it is probably your symptoms are orthopedic in nature, and you are young, female, and generally healthy, still women are not only not immune to heart disease, but often have it manifest in atypical ways. For this reason alone I would suggest you see someone with the intent of having a baseline cario workup with EKG and possibly some specialized blood work, just to rule out any possible early coronary artery or structural heart disease. Again, I feel it is unlikely this is the cause of your symptoms, but given the vague nature of them and the often peculiar presentaions in women, it would be good to have this worry ruled out up front. Then you could safely take your time in trying to figure out what actually is wrong (and of course on the off-chance you do have a heart problem you'd want to know so it could be managed now, before it becomes more serious). I can't emphasize enough my doubts about this being heart-related, but equally strongly cannot emphasize enough the importance, especially in women, of ruling this out due to the often atypical early presentation of symptoms. I just think you'd feel a lot better knowing that's not what's happening. I know I would.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

(I'm currently participating in high school cross country and track) Lately, I've had random times where I can feel my heartbeat, but only for one beat, before it goes away. As far as I can tell, there's no trigger or any easily deducible cause. However, I do have a family history of heart disease on my father's side. I also have problems getting to sleep, which could be related to the palpitations.  I am under quite a bit of stress, because I'm balancing 4 AP classes with cross country, so I generally get a maximum sleep time of only 7 hours. However, it takes me a couple hours to get to sleep, and I generally wake up a half hour before my alarm goes off, which is really irritating. I have never done any drugs, alcohol, or nicotine.  Is there a major problem, or am I just a hypochondriac? Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Random Heart Palpitations",
    "content": "Hi there -- First, you are not a hypchondriac. Okay, then, what you're describing is probably the most common worrisome complaint (even ahead of headaches) in the healthy population, and there's a reason for that: it's a scary sensation. We all have these premature beats, usually premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), sometimes atrial ones (PACs) and even in some people, some other random ones that all pretty much cause the same sensation. They are not, in themselves, dangerous nor are they diagnostic nor predictive of anything. They may occur more in certain types of disease, but this is meaningless because they are caused by so many non-disease things as well, such as (especially in your case) stress, lack of sleep, and anxiety. They also produce anxiety (for obvious reasons) so may cause themselves to increase in frequency because of concern over the rare one that is felt. Occasional ones are not even as annoying as it can get, as there are some people who have these every other beat, all the time. Oddly, they adapt to it more readily than those who have only the occasional one.   Stress,anxiety, sleep deprivation, falling asleep, digestion, caffeine (a biggie), smoking, any stimulant (legal or otherwise), exercise in some people, being still in others, holding one's breath, straining (at stool or lifting something heavy), and just plain slowing of the heart rate as after exercise, are only a few of the innocent causes of premature beats. Some people have a mild anomaly of the mitral valve called mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and these people do tend to have these and other benign arrhythmias even more frequently than the rest, but it still has no significance. The only reason to treat these is if they won't go away on their own and make the patient so anxious as to be unable to function. Then they are treated very conservatively (with beta blocker drugs or anti-anxiety meds). Best left alone, if at all possible, and if they seem extremely frequent or if there are runs of rapid heartbeat that is disruptive of activities, a simple heart checkup can't hurt and often serves to reassure the patient. Nothing wrong with that, and it doesn't make anyone a hypchondriac.   Most people first become aware of these palpitations in the teen years, as there is so much change going on, so many emotions, so many hormones being felt, so much academic and social stress. They are almost always  present in all segments of the population, whether healthy or not.   I would venture to guess there is no reason to be even remotely concerned, but if you are really bothered by these and unable to adapt with reassurance, seeing a sympathetic physician (and that's the key here) can often really help, just having someone acknowlege and explain this phenomenon. It's what I've tried to do here. I hope it helps. Please follow up with us here as needed, and maybe try some stress-management techniques such as meditation, deliberate relaxation, or even a re-evaluation of your priorities in order to enjoy life more as the stressors pile up. Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 28 male, I don't smoke and I work out often. Since May 2009, I've been feeling a dull, light aching feeling at the corners of my pectorals, like the muscles were being pulled down or there was a light pulsing of sorts (hard to explain). It's not painful, just very annoying. Since then, I've been feeling these symptoms more often, though they're never pronounced, and they come and go throughout the day (I notice caffeine makes them worse). Today, my pecs still hurt (there are places on my pecs/side of pecs that hurt/sting when I press on it), as well as the upper part of my ribcage, before it hits the armpits. I press in a certain spot and it's tender to the touch.  I've gone to three doctors. The first doctor said it was GERD, and that I should take over-the-counter heart burn medicine. Being so busy in work/life, I didn't take it as often as I should, but when I did, I felt no different ... and the aching feel occurs whether I'm eating/drinking or not. I told the doctor this, and he had me get some blood work/EKGs done to rule out anything major. Everything came back normal, except my liver enzymes and cholesterol were up a little. A liver sonogram showed no irregularities, so the doctor said to eat better and work out more. I was 242 then (at 6'2) and I ate horribly for years up to that point. Since May, I've been eating better and I've lost 14 pounds. :) The dull pains continued, though.  I went to an Urgent Care to get a second opinion, and the doctor said it was definitely acid reflux, but to make sure, let's get some work done. So, took a urine test (came back normal) and another EKG, which showed I had a incomplete right bundle branch block. The doctor said tons of people have this, and it means nothing, but let's make sure it's not an indicator of something bigger. So I took a Holter Monitor Test and a Nuclear Stress Test, and everything was normal. Still, the aches were there.  Finally, I just recently came back from my family doctor and told him what I'm telling you, and he said that my tests were pretty exhaustive, and that since I'm young, pretty healthy and the test results came back OK, there's nothing to worry about. I told him where it hurt, how I have a bad posture (which often makes my back hurt) and he pressed on several areas of my chest, which didn't produce pain. He said it's musculoskeletal and that if I stand up straight and ease my back, I should be OK. I believe him about his diagnosis, but I don't see how standing up straight can fix this dull aching problem I've been having for months.  In closing, I should tell you that I have OCD, and thus, I always worry, lol. The pain feels like it's definitely coming from my muscle (when I stretch outward, I can hear my chest muscles crackle a bit), and I have reverse posterior subluxation of my shoulders ... don't know if that's affecting/straining anything. Finally, it doesn't hurt when I breathe, I don't have sputum with discoloration and there's no tingling or sharp, shooting pains. The pain I have became more pronounced when I was sick two weeks ago (I still feel a little under the weather) and I find I have to go to the bathroom a lot more than usual.  Is what I'm describing musculoskeletal? What can I do to get rid of this annoying pain? Thanks SO much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- I would concur with all the medical opinions you've received, but especially the final one. This is almost certainly musculoskeletal, and the shoulder subluxaton certainly could be contributory as could poor posture and having carried a good deal of extra weight. Some ways of countering the discomfort would involve stretching exercises as well as careful attention to posture, as people with the combined factors you describe can easily develop thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) and this may even be the cause of your symptoms. TOS is not dangerous but can be quite uncomfortable, and is recognized when the clavicle and first rib become too close together (usually due to poor posture) or if there is (rare) an extra, cervical, rib causing the narrowing of the outlet. Both the brachial arteries and radial and ulnar nerves pass through this space, so these can be pressed upon as well. For some, specific stretching exercises as well as careful attention to corrected posture (and sometimes losing weight) can resolve or improve this. For others, physical therapy is a very helpful adjunct. For a few, surgery to open the outlet is required, but is usually optional.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

I'm also thankful I took the tests to rule out major heart or liver problems.   One last thing: I've noticed my stomach's been upset this past week and a half (it started when I got sick and has stayed), and I just started having a little pressure/soreness on my love handles area, the muscle part. I also get cramps on and off. Could this be connected to the musculoskeletal problem? Or maybe it's a part of GERD, which is causing the muscolosckeletal problems?  Thanks, John. What you do on this site is a blessing.\n\n",

    "content": "This has been happening for the past 7 months or so, it all started with UNBEARABLE anxiety then eventually led to these heart races.  I've had an echo done, a stress echo, ultra sound, and also wore a heart monitor for a week.  The results indicated nothing was wrong, my doctor from miami said there's a good chance it could be psychosematic, and insisted I keep jogging.   Here's a brief background of me.  -I'm an orchestral composer, so I would smoke very small amounts of marijuana before making a piece, despite me only taking 1/10th of what would be considered a cigarette drag, the heart palpatations and anxiety were unbarable, so I've not smoked for 4 months.  -I'm 22 years old, I'm stressed every day about my future, goals, the long run in general, and I come from a family who can be quite paranoid.  -My dad also has these heart conditions, and the doctor has told him he is fine as well and that he is just stressed out.    -There have been three heart related deaths in my family, and one successful heart surgery.  -When I was young, and immature, I did quite a bit of ecstasy (3 pills a week for 3-4 months).  Was never an addiction or problematic, just a careless time in my life.  Anyways I easily stopped for good.  -I also took steroids once when I was 19, for 6 weeks.  Nothing to heavy, the bare minimum, i believe it was called Deca.  -I've been a smoker for 6 years now, used to smoke a pack a day, I'm down to under a 5 a day, still trying to quit.   I informed my doctor about all of this, but I am suprisingly healthy as an ox.  Here in canada, procedures are pretty useless in finding problems, I feel they are far from invasive enough. I'm currenlty looking for a US clinic that does CT scans.  Anyways, today I was in a movie theater, and randomly, my stomach dropped, the screen became wobbly giving me motion sickness (which I never get) and I knew immediately my heart was about to reach a bpm over 120 in a matter of 10 seconds.  Mind over mattering is nearly impossible.  I got up, went to the washroom and splashed cold water on my face, in about  7 minutes my shakey legs and heart were almost back to normal.  Seriously, what could this be?  I'm going to try and quit cigarettes tomorrow for as long as possible, sometimes I feel that by just smoking one during the day affects me subconciously, and is maybe triggering my heart.  I'm pretty annoyed with the idea this could be \"psychosematci.\"   Can the mind be that powerful to randomly attack your heart without ONE thought on it except the movie, raising my bmp to a catastrophic 140 bpm? My bpm is not over exaggerated, for I have measured with my piano's metrahome on several occasions.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Spontaneous Heart racing (over 120 bpm)",
    "content": "Hello -- There's very little question in my mind you're suffering from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) probably punctuated by panic attacks. Everything you describe, as well as the way you describe it, suggests this. I am not quick, either, to write off symptoms to anxiety. This is a rather classic presentation, however. Further, 120 beats per minute, while beyond the high end of the normal range (at least in some texts -- it is 120 in others) is not a dangerous rate assuming it is sinus rhythm. This is easily distinguished by means of a resting EKG. And if you were to reach 140 BPM during a panic attack, this would not be \"catastrophic\" though it might be disturbing. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia is quite common with panic disorder. Also, a CT would be of no particular value in ruling out any sort of heart problems. The first line imaging test in this case would be an echocardiogram, which might well help reassure you some, since it can illuminate the internal structures of the heart and if you are one of those people whose anxiety is associated with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) it would definitely be reasssuring, since MVP is often seen in conjunction with anxiety that is seemingly baseless (no obvious situational cause) and is also quite benign despite the often pecular and disturbing symptoms. Knowing can help one to adapt to the symptoms, which often makes them subside. Strange but true.  The former chemical indescretions may safely be set aside. While THC is often a contributing cause in anxiety attacks (very common, actually), it won't cause any lasting damage. The ecstasy use is in the past now, and if there was no acute injury at the time there won't be any long-term residual problem. Your steroid use (Decadron) was limited and again not likely to have caused any long-term problems. You do smoke but not much and are working on that. Keep up the good work!   If it is possible in the Canadian system, you really should look into evaluation for possible GAD and/or panic disorder (PD). You sound every bit the classic anxious patient, and given the fact you are under a great deal of stress and are aware of people having died in your family due to heart-related issues, these are the sorts of things that can set us up for sudden and unexpected anxiety and panic attacks. The latter, in particular, can definitely come \"out of the blue\" with no apparent topical content to trigger them, and the patient is often the last one to recognize the emotional content if there is any. Patient will often deny the problem most vociferously because he is unaware of the connection between certain psychological stressors and the symptoms which seem to literally come out of nowhere.  I very much hope this is helpful to you. Consider what I've said and follow up accordingly. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 27, male, and was previously a light smoker (0-5 cigarettes a day).  I have had occasional bouts of left-side chest pain for a few years now. Previously, it never lasted more than a day or two, and the intervals between events were substantial, but I've now had it for a week and a half straight.  It is a fairly mild pain (maybe a 2 on a pain scale), but it is essentially 24/7.  It seems to be inversely related to physical activity - I primarily experience it while sitting or lying down, but if I go for a walk, it largely goes away (I do not know whether it's actually going away, or if the pain is mild enough that the activity makes it less noticeable).  I visited my doctor a few days ago.  He did an EKG (looked normal) and hypothesized that it's acid reflux, so he gave me some prilosec samples and ordered an upper GI.  The upper GI came back entirely normal, no reflux was seen, but I was advised to continue taking the two week course of prilosec and wait-and-see.  So far (3 days in now), the prilosec doesn't seem to be having an effect.  Additional information:  While I generally feel okay (other than the chest pain), I tend to feel generally unwell (slight nausea, dizziness, shortness of breath) in the evening.  I have also, just in the past few days, developed difficulty waking up in the morning.  I do not mean that I just can't drag myself out of bed, I mean my alarm clock (which is EXTREMELY loud) just doesn't wake me up.  My roommate has woken me up twice in the last three or four days after my alarm had already been going off for 5-10 minutes.  I previously suffered from constant-but-mild muscle pain and twitching.  An MRI showed that I don't have MS, and a blood test showed that I had a B12 deficiency, so my doctor figured that was the cause.  The twitching is not entirely gone, but has greatly diminished.    Ideas?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- The pain you describe really disqualifies itself as cardiac in several ways, the main one being that it goes away during exertion and is only felt at rest. This is precisely the obverse of what one would see with almost any sort of heart disease, even if of the structural type. On the other hand you do describe some things that suggest you may be of an axious disposition, and anxiety is, oddly enough, commonly associated with left-chest pain (left chest pain is also extremely rare in relation to cardiac problems, another disqualifier). Further, pain that would be constant as you've described would be progressive. The whole cardiac explanation falls apart at this point, and while it could be anxiety-related, it could also be due to some unrelated physical problem. It would seem GERD has been ruled out, and it really doesn't sound much like that either, anyway. I'd look at the possibility of costochondritis, especially if the pain can be duplicated or aggravated by manual pressure on the affected area. This would, in fact, pretty much nail chostochondritis, an inflammation of the connective tissue between the ribs. I'd also want to rule out anxiety and possible splenic flexure syndrome. In this latter situation gas becomes trapped in the 90 degree turn of the colon near the spleen, where the transverse colon makes the sharp downward turn. Often gas can become trapped here, and this can press upward against the diaphragm, which can, in turn, refer vague (or sometimes even sharp) pain up to the left chest area. There a many possibilities. Cardiac-related doesn't seem to be one of them.  I do hope this helps. Good luck to you and please follow up  with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- Mobitz type 1 (Wenchebach) is a benign condition that rarely requires any medical intervention. Pregnancy is one situation where it could, possibly, cause some problems, at least during delivery, as the enormous straining, which constitutes what's known as a valsalva maneuver, can slow the heart rate momentarily, so with even a relatively minor block like Mobitz 1, it's possible to slow the rate to the point where it could be problematic. During all other times, unless you've been markedly symptomatic, I don't see why your cardiologist would even bother to offer pacing. He of course knows your situation better than I, and if there's been any significant symptoms this may be a worthwhile backup scheme.   Hope this helps. Good luck to you,\n\n",

    "title": "Re: PVCs and fainting",
    "content": "Hi there -- Here's the problem: PVCs in themselves are not a cause of anything, nor are they predictive nor diagnostic. They occur in almost all of us at some time or another, and in some people they are extremely frequent. There was once a concern about the R-on-T phenomenon, the unusual \"badly timed\" PVC that could start a dangerous ventricular arrhythmia. We're now finding R-on-T has little statistical importance either. The problem arises because any rhythm that originates in the ventricles is going to basically be made up of PVCs, whether a relatively \"slow\" run of a few or many, or a lot and very rapid. The PVCs don't themselves cause this to happen though, and this can happen, in certain patient populations, whether or not there are any PVCs occurring before the arrhythmia takes place -- usually ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) -- which can start spontaneously and sometimes causes a faint or deteriorates quickly into ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) which definitely will not sustain life for long.   It would appear you had at least a brief, rapid episode of V-tach. Whether or not it turned quickly into V-fib then converted spontaneously (the latter is relatively unsual but can happen, especially if one hits the floor hard) is moot, since you say you have a \"damaged\" left ventricle, which probably means you have a low ejection fraction, which is the single most significant risk factor for potentially lethal arrhythmias. The best outcome for this sort of problem has been, most recently, implantation of a personal defibrillator (IED), even though the scary episode may just as well never occur again. It is very difficult to be certain if this will repeat itself or not, and whether or not it will spontaneously resolve. An electrophysiology (EP) study is required to determine this, and if, during such a study, the subject heart can be driven into V-tach or V-fib, it is then called \"inducible\" and the patient is considered a candidate for an IED, which provides,for now, the greatest protection against sudden cardiac arrest. There are also medications that can help reduce the likelihood of such an event, but the IED is the ultimate weapon. As to your original question, again, we all have PVCs, and that alone does not place us all at anything near high risk for an episode such as you experienced. It is the damaged left ventricle, with the attendant low ejection fraction, that predisposes some to these events. Others have frequent PVCs for most of a lifetime and never experience a sudden arrest of near-arrest. It's hard to know which happened to you, but you definitely will need to submit to an EP study to determine if you are at risk of a repeat and if you may need an IED implanted. I hope the cardiology consult gets done in a timely manner, and if there is any further suggestion, even, of a repeat event, please have yourself taken to an emergency medical facility so you can be evaluated and managed right away. Waiting isn't necessarily a good idea.   I hope this helps. Please follow up with us here as needed and by all means update us after you've seen the cardiologist. Good luck to you.\n\n",

The dilated left ventricle is the real bugaboo in all this, but if you can get the right results on the EP test you may be better off than things would appear. It's not a test you can study for, but looking at it with a positive slant certainly can help. Let us know how things go, and thanks for the follow up. Best to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- While I don't think your symptoms are likely heart-related, this is as good an area as any to ask about the problem, and probably the best starting place, if only to eliminate heart issues. Of course it is possible this could be heart related, but it really doesn't sound much like it at all. It does sound as though it could possibly be caused by a condition called thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), which often causes chest pain and tenderness, numbness, tingling and \"weird\" sensations in the arm and hand on the affected side, and sometimes even puffiness in the hand on the affected side. It can affect just the ulnar nerve that passes between the collar bone and first rib, or sometimes can compress both the nerve and the blood vessels that pass through this space. This would seem most likely to me, although because of your overweight and bad family heart history I'd like to see at least a cursory cardiac workup first, just to be perfectly clear on this. It's the best way to work out things, from the top down, rule out the most serious possibilties first, then go on down to the more likely and less worrisome ones (TOS isn't dangerous, just annoying and sometimes pretty uncomfortable). A simple cardiac eval including resting EKG and a good listen to the chest/heart should rule out any frank heart issues. An MRI of the brachial plexus (area including the shoulder, deltoid and upper chest) may disclose TOS, which sometimes is due to an extra (cervical) rib or sometimes poor posture. It often responds well to physical therapy or posture exercises, but if there's a cervical rib present it may require removal of the rib to relieve the symptoms -- which then becomes a matter of just how much do you want to get rid of the symptoms, since they won't do any real damage, but can be pretty uncomfortable. The rib thing is not that common, but is sometimes present. More often the TOS is caused by poor posture over a long time or even to a physical trauma.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Looks as though my response and your second post overlapped backwards. Sorry about that! It happens sometimes, probably due to time zone differences. Anyway, the headaches and facial tingling could be related to the other stuff, but there is always the possibility of a crazy coincidence where two different things are going on at once. When this happens people (doctors included) tend to look at them as one complaint due to one problem -- a quirk of human nature I suppose -- but often there is comorbidity -- two different things happening at once. It's not much different than catching a cold right about the time you break an arm, except we have no doubt the broken arm won't be making your nose run. :)  The headaches and facial tingling, since the latter is confined to one side, should probably be explored as a possible separate entity. And your boyfriend may be more anxious than he sounds and trying to play it off by making these \"jokes\", but he really needs to be a little more sensitive! I don't think anything terrible is going on, but when we don't know what's causing odd symptoms we do tend to become anxious and usually go to the worst case scenario in our minds. You don't need any extra suggestions like that!   Don't let the medical people give you the brush-off. Pursue this and maybe even suggest the possibility the two problems may be separate. There's a tendency, when a patient is anxious because of symptoms, to attribute the symptoms to pre-existing anxiety -- another human nature thing but one that often causes a concrete problem to be missed or the diagnosis delayed. Make sure you're treated like a person and not a set of symptoms.   Let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- First, the list of medications your husband is currently taking is mind-boggling, so I am assuming his heart attack was fairly serious. Hopefully over time this list can be thinned out, as adding yet another (citalopram) is only going to make keeping track more difficult. Now then, one of the warnings in the literature for the drug in question suggests informing the doctor who prescribes it if one has had a recent heart attack. The reasoning behind this isn't at all clear, but duly noted. However, since the cardiologist was the one who prescribed it, he knows the heart attack (and surgery) took place and how long it's been, what stage of recovery your husband is in, and also (most importantly) that not only is depression very common after bypass surgery, but that depression significantly increases the risk of cardiac complications after heart attack and/or heart surgery, so has weighed the risk vs. benefit of prescribing this drug and I believe has made a safe and wise decision. Your husband may well be suffering post-event depression, and this really needs to be managed so he can continue to improve without setbacks.   Hope ths helps explain this. Good luck to you both and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- If I'm understanding you correctly, you have pericardial effusion (the sac around your heart has filled with fluid) due to chemo and radiation therapy, which does happen sometimes. I'm not a big believer in use of Lasix to reduce this fluid, especially when it's compromising heart function to the extent you're having it happen. While it may sound odd or scary, this fluid can be drawn off by needle aspiration and might have to be done more than once. It takes a skilled and steady had to do this, but it's not really a complex procedure, just should be CT-guided to make certain the needle is positioned correctly. In a couple minutes the fluid can be drawn off and this relieves the pressure on the heart. Lasix can help sometimes, but it is rarely real effective in this particular area. It sounds as though you're really being compromised by this, and needle aspiration would probably be appropriate. Ask your doctor about this as an elective procedure. You could well be feeling normal again in only a few minutes. Otherwise the fluid could linger for a pretty long time, and Lasix can cause other side effects you don't need.   Hope this helps. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 29 year old paramedic.  I am a smoker of 12 years, about half a pack per day.  No medical history, however there is significant heart history in the family.  Today at work I have been feeling under the weather and decided to evaluate my EKG.  I immediately noticed an abnormality, which after careful research I have learned to be known as \"P Wave Alternans\".  There is no other obvious findings to me on my EKG.  I also have mild chest discomfort particular to the Left side \"pressure/burning\" near the mid-axillary line under the clavical, I have had this persistant discomfort all day along with mild back pain and shoulder pain.  I initially passed off the discomfort as inflamation due to a previous shoulder/back injury.  I have however been feeling easily fatigued for a couple of years, feeling like sleeping a lot more.  I have done previous EKGs and have never seen the \" P Wave Alternans\".  12 lead EKG was also taken, unfortunately it was not during a phase of the \"P Wave Alternans\" but it did read Left Axis Deviation and Pulmonary Disease Pattern, which previous 12 lead EKG's have shown years ago.  I occasionally get light headed if I stand from a supine position to rapidly, or overwork myself.  I am obviously going to see a cardiologist very soon.  Just wondering if there are any other thoughts on these symptoms, \"cardiomyopathy?, paricarditis?, paricardial effusion?, tamponade?\"  Kind of worried about it, as my research has shown that this reading on an EKG is extremely rare.  The local ER doctor said he had heard of it before but never seen it, and consulted with a local cardiologist that seemed to have no clue about it.  Also spoke to a nursing student who found no reference to it in any of his books.  And, there is very little information about it online.  My vitals are in great limits, BP 120/79, heart rate mid 80s slightly irregular but strong.  Please give me advice/opinions/suggestions about what might be going on......I know, quit smoking and see the cardiologist are priority :)\n\n",

    "title": "Re: EKG: P Wave Alternans with mild discomfort",
    "content": "Hello -- Two possibilities come to mind right away. First, given the admittedly atypical discomfort with the finding of P wave alternans, pericardial effusion (usually in conjunction with pericarditis) is possible, esepcially if deep breathing causes the pain to increase in with pleurisy (pericarditis/effusion will cause pleuritic pain). This would need to be proven first, then usually responds well to NSAIDs.   Another possibility is a misinterpretation of the P wave anomaly which may actually be wandering pacemaker rather than alternans, and might well account for a slightly irregular rhythm as you mention. This would also allow for the otherwise fairly normal findings you report. As a rule this requires no intervention.   The cardiologist should be able to nail the diagnosis at first glance, especially if you've mistaken wandering pacemaker for P alternans -- which happens more often than you might believe (rode the ambulance for 30 years, spent another 10 inside, have seen some pretty interesting things).   Hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed, and by all means update us after you've seen the cardio. Good  luck!\n\n",

    "content": "In the last year or so I've had some chest pains that are very painful.  It seems to be in my chest inside of my chest beneath my right breast.  The pain starts slowly and then gradually intensifies and grows to major pain and then slowly fades away again.  This happens every 20 minutes or so for hours.  Nothing helps, but to wait it out each time. I have tried laying on each side, back, stomach, sitting and standing.  This has happened about 10 times in the last year.  I'm not sure if it's a reaction to what I'm eating (seems to happen soon after dinner) or what.  Last night I had brown rice and a curry and eggs dish I make for the whole family.  I also get the shivers and very sick to my stomach, too. My fiance thinks I have pulled a muscle but I didn't lift anything heavy last night when it happened. A friend said it could be gas pains.  It leaves me very short of breath during the pain and I can't take take a breath in very well or exhale either.    I have no insurance coverage as of last month and no extra money to visit a doctor - i don't even have a doctor.  Does anyone know what this might be and what I can do to prevent it???  I have no preexisting conditions other than weight gain (30 pounds in the last 2 years) and I smoked for 10 years but quit on 12/21/04 so i'm almost 5 years smoke free.  I'm not allergic to anything as far as I know.  I do cardio as far as riding my bike, jogging and walking 2-3 times a week since January  (I've lost 8 pounds this year) but haven't worked out since Tuesday so I'm not sure if that's it either.  I drink a liter plus of water a day.  I'm at a loss and it really bothers me that I can't figure out what is wrong with my own body.  Please help. My fiance was scared to death and I have a 13 year old son so i don't want to get sick and scare him.  The pains scare me and I don't want it to get more frequent.  Thank you for your time.    Sincerely, Sherry C. Houston, TX\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Frequent and scary deep painful chest pains on right side",
    "content": "Hi Sherry -- First, please set aside, for the moment, your concerns about having no health insurance. Having no health is a greater concern, and more and more doctors are now willing to work with patients on terms and reduced rates if approached ernestly. Things are tough all over, but you cannot ignore potentially serious medical problems because of this, and you won't find a cure on line, but you may at least find some helpful direction. That's our goal here, and I think, given your description of the symptoms, I have a pretty good idea what's going on. I could of course be wrong, since I'm unable to perform any tests at a distance, or even look at you and get a feel from that as to what's happening, but you've described a pretty classic case of gallbladder disease (cholecystitis). If I'm right, a simple surgery might be needed, and to know this, a fairly simple imaging test is required to determine if your gallbladder is working. The reason, aside from pain and feeling sick, this needs to be addressed, is that if this is what's happening it doesn't get better on its own and, in fact, could eventually make you quite ill and unable to function. The pain you're having is slightly atypical, but is on the correct (right) side, and is just a little higher than normal for gallbladder disease, but there's more here that makes me suspect this: You have this after eating, you become ill and sometimes have \"shivers\" (chills) and nausea, all of which are typical of gallbladder disease. Since this has happened during the time you gained some weight, that's another factor, since slight overweight (or more) is often complicit in this problem. While the attacks normally occur after a fatty meal, any food may trigger it in a given person. Chills, nausea, right-sided pain (usually in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen but often referred up into the right chest or even shoulder), overweight, episodes after the evening meal, this all fits the picture of gallbladder disease very closely -- and not much else. It could, of course, be something else, and only a doctor can ascertain this for sure, but I would not be at all surprised if you were tested for cholecystitis and found to have a gallbladder full of stones and/or sludge. When this happens the ony thing that will relieve it is removal, which involves less than a 24 hour downtime and usually recovery within a few days.  If there's something else causing this you also need to know. It's not getting better after a year (and this is another reason to suspect a diseased gallbladder), so there needs to be found a way to get the diagnosis and treatment accomplished. This can be done, but sometimes requires being frank with a sympathetic physician who will work with you where the costs are concerned. The alternative is to continue to put up with this very painful condition and have it slowly get worse. This is never a wise course. Trust me, there's a way to get these things done. I hope you'll consider this and explore those possibilities. I also feel fairly certain you'll be surprised to learn you do, in fact, have gallbladder disease. You tolerate exercise well, so that pretty well eliminates cardiac problems from the menu.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 22 year old female who for the past month or so has been experiencing alot of chest pains and arrythmia. I have been to the ER twice due to so called panic attacks and rapid heartbeats. I have had three EKGs done and all they could find was slight arrythmia, and short PRs. Also, for many days I have been having serious breathlessness at rest. To make a long story short, since the ER doctors weren't able to say anything more than I was having a panic attack and perscribe anti-depressants I got really aggrivated. Several days later, a friend of ours called, and told us about a nutritionist in MI who saved and cured him from both Asian Orange and Candida. Desperate, we decided to try an alternate route, and go with a non-traditional method of diagnostics.   In the testing, she preformed electrolysis on my nerve endings. It concluded that I had Candida, hypoglycemia, a problem with my thyroid and pancreas. (The doctors had done series of blood tests, and found nothing wrong with my thyroid or sugar levels) She said my heart was fine and it was only my nerves that were sending the heart pain signals. Also, over the years, she said I had contracted about 27 different kinds of toxic metals into my system. She perscribed me about 20 different herbs, and what not to help my thyroid, digestive system, and get rid of the metals.  My question is however, should I go see a cardiologist? My heart related pains have gotten progressivly worse, and it still scares me that something is wrong. My pain, at times extends down my shoulder blade, deltoid, and pinky finger. I also have sudden bursts of pain in my left side and around the breast. I am sure my nerves have a small roll it everything, but when I feel suddenly breathless, or pains with a high pulse, it does upset me. I have no medical insurance at all, and am already up to my neck in doctor bills. Could someone please tell me if I really need to see a cardiologist or is my condition nothing to really worry about...\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- While I'd be the last person to blow off holistic or alternative medicine, at least when practiced intelligently and in concert with conventional medicine, it sounds as though you've been through a series of less-than-thorough medical providers and at least one charlatan \"alternative\" medicine practitioner. There is no physical way of diagnosing random diseases via \"electrolysis\" or whatever was done to you, and your symptoms do sound as though they could have some structural cardiological basis. While what I suspect is mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVPS) as the most likely culprit, there is no way of being certain without at least an echocardiogram and possibly a Holter monitor to determine what, if any, structural problems exist (and probably this would be MVP, which  is a common and benign anomaly often associated with certain equally benign arrhythmias which may benefit from a simple medication or simple reassurance. Panic disorder is also often seen in conjunction with MVP, which often responds to reassurance and sometimes also to certain anti-anxiety drugs. This is what this all sounds most like, but of course there could be something else going on, and either way the same sort of competent cardio workup is the only way it can be uncovered. Once it's established what, if anything, is wrong (other than a possible anxiety problem) then whatever it is needs to be addressed sympathetically by a physician. The problem is affecting your ability to function and enjoy life, so the cost will have to be worked out some way. Many people are presently without insurance, so doctors are often more willing to negotiate terms, and this may be something to look into. I don't think you have coronary artery disease, but you may well have a combination of mild structural issue (MVP most likely) and some attendant anxiety/panic problems. These can be managed fairly easily, and otherwise you'll just wind up feeling worse and losing more ground and time you could be working toward a happier, less stressful life.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: heart beat changes for no reason",
    "content": "Hi there -- The bleeding episode, while scary, has passed now, and would have nothing to do with the tricks your heart seems to be playing. While it is likely these are premature ventricular contraction (PVCs) possibly occurring as bigemeny (every other beat is a premature beat, which cuts the effective rate in half while it's happening, though pumping roughly the same amount of blood), it's impossible to know for sure if this is the case, at least at a distance. If it is PVCs there's probably nothing to be concerned about, as they are almost never of any significance, although they can feel scary and uncomfortable. However, since I can't see your heart's activity via an EKG strip, I would recommend, just to be on the safe side, you have both a resting EKG and possibly a 24 hour Holter monitor (records all your heart's activity for 24 hours and is then read and anythng \"interesting\" shows up correlated with what you were doing at the time, as noted in a log you carry and write notes in). This would clarify fairly well what, if anything, is going on. I suspect nothing but, again, since I can't see the actual activity of your heart, and because there are some other electrical issues that could possibly cause this sort of symptom and are more worrisome, it's best to rule them out right now and get on with enjoying your life. If for some strange reason there were something more serious going on you'd want to know so as to fix it, right? And if not you can essentially forget about the poundings in the chest,as most of us do get these, although it's more common at rest than during exercise.   Hope this helps. Again, most likely you're having the usual premature beats we all get sometimes, but it bothered you enough to ask, and you deserve a comprehensive answer. Please point this out to your parents and have them arrange for you to have the cardiac workup including Holter monitor, then we can all relax. :)  Best of luck to you. Please let us know how this all pans out.\n\n",

It usually acts up after or during a hot bath, standing too long, stress, right when I awaken, or seemingly at random.  When my heart acts up too much, I get light headed, dizzy, then get a ringing in my ears until I can't hear, and spots on my eyes till I can't see.  I also occasionally get a numb feeling in my left arm, and my veins stand out.  This past Tuesday, after clocking my heart at over 120 beats per minute at a resting heart rate at 7:45 a.m., I finally passed out after standing for 1 hour at 8:45 a.m.  When I came to, I was crazy hot and sweating, which is weird because I never sweat.  I also had a stomach ache that felt almost exactly like cramps, but went away after a bit.    Then this morning, I woke up and checked my pulse, but it wasn't the normal \"ba-bump! ba-bump!\" that is normal.  Instead, it was more like a swish-swish, swish-swish.  It reminded me of a washing machine.  All day, I've felt lightheaded and just weird.  Any thoughts?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Irregular heart rate and rhythm when triggered",
    "content": "Hello -- What you describe, for the most part, sounds like the usual combo platter of premature heartbeats we all have from time to time. These, in themselves, are not dangerous, nor are they at all unusual -- almost everyone has these as a relatively random occurrence, and for most people they actually occur more often when at rest than when active. However, you do describe some other symptoms and triggering mechanisms which may suggest something additional is going on, and this is probably worth a look. What specifically concerns me is the tendency to lightheadedness and even fainting, especially after standing for a prolonged period of time. This is suggestive of potural hypotension, often seen in combination with vasovagal syncope (fainting) and postural orthostatic tachycardia, all part of the same spectrum of autonomic nervous system misbehavior that can cause the symptoms you describe (without giving undue weight to the premature beats). For this reason I would suggest a cardiac workup with possible tilt-table test to see if you are especially vulnerable to vasovagal or orthotstatic problems. While these aren't exactly directly heart-related, the heart does get involved. There is also another, similar problem seen especially in women called neurocardiogenic syncope, which produces the same sorts of symptoms. All of these are imbalances of the autonomic nervous system which to an extent controls the heart's behavior as well as that of blood pressure regulating apparatus. While not in itself life-threatening, it can be an awful nuisance, can produce a great deal of anxiety, and in some people can actually result in injury due to falling during a faint. It also is medically manageable, which is nice.   I would request a cardiological workup including all the usual tests but especially the tilt table in your case. First, though, a simple resting EKG would be in order. If that shows up nothing, the rest of the workup can be done til the symptoms can be reproduced and a treatment plan set up. This is not a terribly big deal, but it is somethng best dealt with sooner than later, if only to avoid a blow to the head from falling.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed an especially if anything new happens or you think of anything else that may apply here. Good luck to you.\n\n",

His Dr. was on vacation when he went about 6 weeks ago.  He said the temp Dr. he saw didn't listen to him and sent him for a MRI for a MS test which came back fine.  A $1000 MRI bill later he decided to wait to see if it would go away.

    "content": "I am a 25 five year old male with an athletic built. I generally keep in good shape and even ran in a Half Marathon in Nov 2008.  1.\tIn Feb 2009, I was diagnosed with Erythema Multiforme. My skin doctor prescribed Predace(Methypredisolone) for 3-4 weeks and I had to gradually taper it off. I did the same and my skin healed completely. 2.\tAfter a month I felt that my digestion was getting weaker as I was not passing stools properly. Then one day I got these palpitations which lasted for nearly 35-40 minutes and I had a bit of difficulty while breathing but didn\u2019t feel any pain. I rushed to the hospital and got an ECG done right away. The ECG was completely normal but my heart was still beating at 108-110 bpm and after some time the palpitations were gone. The doctor's first diagnosis was stress & anxiety but he still prescribed me to go for Blood Work, Tread Mill Test (TMT - Bruce Protocol) and Thyroid Function Test as my father had passed away due to Heart Failure. All tests came back normal. The doctor prescribed me Deanxite and Petril .5 mg for a couple of weeks. Once or twice after this I felt my heart was beating fast but it wasn\u2019t anything like the palpitations that I had. 3.\tI didn\u2019t have any major palpitation attack after that but my stomach worsened and after some time I was diagnosed with acute acidity, gas and Irritable Bowel Syndrome and was given Bifilac HP and Nexpro by my doctor. My condition improved by I still at times I could feel my heart rate getting faster and my doctor told me it could be due to the gasses pushing up against my diaphragm. 4.\tSlowly I left taking any medicine and was quite OK for some time and then one night while sleeping I could feel my heart beat in my head.  The same continued for some time and I could not sleep properly on some nights. I even feel a dull & mild pain in my chest\u2013left side, left arm, right arm and legs but it goes away after some time. Sometimes I can even feel twitching in my arms or legs; it is like I can feel my pulse there. 5.\tFinally, today in the morning I had this filled up sensation and it took some effort to breathe in deeply. After some time my heart rate got really fast and should have been more than 120 bmp. It lasted for a couple of minutes and then it slowed down to 85-86 bmp. I even felt weak in my legs for some time. Please let me know how should I proceed? Should I go for a Holter Monitor and an Echocardiogram test or is it just anxiety and stress? Can the holter & echo catch something that the ECG and the TMT might have missed in the first place?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- While a TMT is helpful, it's not the gold standard for ruling out heart disease. However, in this case it was the most appropriate test, along with the others, and I think it reasonably ruled out coronary artery disease. Since you suffer from IBS and have some GI complaints, it is highly likely this is at least partly responsible for the increased rate, the palpitations, etc., as anything that can upset the stomach will automatically affect the vagus nerve. Digestion -- and indigestion -- as well as bloating, gas, diarrhea, etc., all can stimulate the vagus nerve, which not only runs the peristaltic process in the GI tract but also serves to slow the heart rate (and if the rate is unnecessarily increased it tries to slow it anyway, causing PVCs, which you might compare to backfire from an internal combustion engine when downshifting to slow the machine). This is likely what's going on, and at your age you've had sufficient testing to at least rule out coronary artery disease. You may, however, have either an anxiety issue (always a consideration, but we must be careful not to assume this is the root cause without ruling out physical issues and addressing them).   Treating IBS will be important and may well help reduce these symptoms. The Holter monitor wouldn't do any harm, and might even serve as as a good reassurance for you, so you might ask for this as a rather conclusive rule-out. Otherwise, you might have to look at anxiety as a potential partial cause of all the problems (including IBS) once all physical problems have been accounted for or ruled out.  I hope this  is helpful. Please do follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

The er sent me home wout any tests and said they were benign. Is that true? I always get pvcs, but not one every fourth beat. I am scared to sleep now. Will this lead to vtach?? What if I get a PVC at the wrong moment, doesn't that cause vtach? I am so scared and haven't been feeling right...which doesn't help. Oh and my nails aren't raynauds...I know that much.

    "title": "Re: PVC every fourth beat- scared",
    "content": "Hi there -- While you may have something -- probably largely of nuisance value, but that remains to be seen -- going on, the PVCs are not the problem, and there are a tremendous amount of outdated notions still floating around about the matter. The fact is PVCs are almost never -- ever -- dangerous nor predictive nor diagnostic of anything. They are seen in most normal people, and so are almost always seen in those with heart disease. However, every fourth beat isn't really even \"frequent\" although if this went on for 24 hours you'd have had quite a few of them. It just doesn't matter and, in your case the reason they're happening is that your autonomic nervous system is causing them by trying to slow your heart's rate (the parasympathetic system, the vagus nerve, is the \"brake\" on the heart's rate, the sympathetic side the accelerator). The real problem here, if in fact there is one, is just why your heart is reaching unusually rapid rates for no apparent reason. It could be supraventricular tachycarida (SVT), it could be inappropriate tachycardia syndrome (ITS) or something similar. It's certainly worth pursuing, even though it's probably not dangerous in and of itself. It's exteremely bothersome at least. But the PVCs, no, that's just your body doing what's normal, and when the heart has something on the other side working against the brake (the accelerator pedal gets stuck while the brake is on) and PVCs naturally result from this. The goal needs to be to find what's causing the tachycardia, determine what's the best way to manage it, and get that program started so you can relax and feel better about this.   Regarding the positive nuclear scan/stress test, these are occasionally false positive, especially in women. Your problem isn't consistent, either, with cornonary artery disease. It could be consistent with some valvular abnormality, so an echocardiogram may well be in order, but even that seems unlikely. The purplish nail beds may well be a variation of normal, and as long as capilary refill (blanching with pressure on the beds followed by rapid recovery of color, even if its the \"wrong\" shade) is normal. I'm assuming that's been checked and you can even check this yourself by pressing on the end of one nail to see watch the bed blanch then the color return. If for some reason return of color takes more than 2 seconds, you may be suffering from dehydration, and this also could account for your increased heart rate, although routine blood work should have already exposed this.  The  old notion that frequent or ill-timed PVCs has been largely discredited. Even in the setting of a frank heart attack half those who experience dangerous arrhythmias have not had that R-on-T phenomenon you're thinking of, that Ill-timed PVC. And half who have that phenomenon occur do not ever have a dangerous arrhythmia. Based on this knowlege we have essentially abandoned all but (unfortunately) the teaching of recognition of the phenomenon. Even having said that, there's no reason to assume any one of us -- and we all have PVCs from time to time -- might have an R-on-T PVC and if we did we'd be unaware if it anyway. In other words, no, those PVCs are not a cause for concern and in this case, in fact, show your body is trying to do things right. There's something else going on that would be useful to uncover.

    "content": "Hello -- While it would be sheer speculation, it is conceivable there was some sort of reflexive/reactive nerve response caused by the ablation, although I've never heard of this happening and can't even mentally trace the path by which this could take place. Still it is conceivable, and ought to be considered in any differential diagnosis, although this would seem a fairly benign problem and may well be something that will, with time, become less perceptible and perhaps may well be anxiety-related. I'm loathe to write off things -- unless obvious -- to anxiety. Still, this is one of those things that probably won't matter in the grand scheme of things, but is nonetheless bothersome and might actually produce some anxiety after the fact.   There's nothing I can find in the literature regarding this phenomenon, but will continue to look  because your story is convincing and even if this has no clinical significance it is probably extremely annoying. If I or anyone else here at The Lounge can come up with a viable theory we'll be sure to add it to this thread.

    "title": "Re: Chest Pain on Left side during exercise",
    "content": "Hello -- The pain you describe is almost certainly musculoskeletal, for several reasons. I'll explain: first, cardiac pain is almost never sudden in onset, nor is it sharp, stabbing, nor fleeting. It's also almost never felt in the area you describe, and is almost never highly localized. As you describe the onset and nature of the pain, and because of your relatively new (and progressive) exercise program, especially having lost a good deal of weight already (and congratulations on a job well done! Keep up the great work) you are more susceptible to muscle and cartilege pulls. What you describe sounds like it may be Tietz's syndrome, a form of costochondritis, inflammation or irritation of the connective tissue between the ribs and and that seems to be where this is coming from.   If the pain is disruptive of your exercise program you might try preventive use of something such as Advil (ibuprofin) or Aleve (naproxyn sodium) which are both effective in managing this sort of inflammatory problem.   This also could be a simple nerve irritation, again something that will often happen in formerly sedentary people starting new exercise programs (and yours is still relatively new). You're doing a great job, keep at it, and the pain you've already demonstrated will stop before you're forced to, so it's not cardiac in nature. I think that's probably the most important consideration here. Controlling the pain is probably secondary unless it's actually disabling. Again, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) available over the counter are your best bet to prevent or at least reduce the intensity and frequency of this problem.   Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us as necessary. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "tapering off atenolol",
    "content": "hi. first my story: i've been on atenolol for about a year. started at a low dose to ease pvcs and IST (inappropriate sinus tachycardia). my old doctor had me at 75mg at day (50 in the morning, 25 at night). long story short, i wasn't fond of this doctor and i went to a new one, how didn't agree with the IST diagnosis. my first holter had an average HR of 96 or so, but resting rate about 82-86. he didn't think this warranted the diagnosis, nor did he think that the dose was in anyway appropriate for me (20, female, 120lbs.) i happen to agree with him, as i believe that from the start, i sort of worked myself into thinking i had some heart issue, when it was just anxiety (landed myself in the ER twice). also, the atenolol at that dose had my blood pressure at 90/50 some times, my feet and hands freezing, my metabolism slow, and my temperature low.   so this summer i've been tapering off the atenolol. it's been fine so far. going down gradually every two-three weeks or so. occasionally, mostly the first week on the lowered dose, i get a few more pvcs than usual, and my hr is a little higher than what it was on the full dose (was 60s, 70s, now around 80-85). i'm at the last \"stage\": 12.5mg in the morning, with no dose at night. now i don't know if it's because i'm used to a dose at night, but i'll occasionally have a higher resting hr in the 90s, later in the evening. sometimes i don't notice it until i catch my pulse in some way, and other times it's very noticeable. i've been on this new dose for about four days. maybe it's just harder at this last stage, but i'm feeling more uncomfortable than the other tapering steps.  my questions are: should i be concerned at all, or should i give it more time? i know with many other drugs, that it takes my body a lot longer to react/adjust to them, so maybe this is the case? lastly, should i take one more last step before being off the medication completely (like 6.25mg for a little while next)?   thank you so much for your opinion on this matter.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: tapering off atenolol",
    "content": "Hi there. I agree compleletly with your new doctor (and your own instincts in this situation): The numbers you state do not qualify as IST, but are simply beteen the median and upper range of normal. You've been tapering off the atenolol for all the usual reasons, the somewhat noxious side-effects not warranted by the symptoms. You've done it all right so far, and here is the sticking point with tapering off: when beta blockers are used for any significant length of time, the body will attempt to grow additional beta receptors because it senses the blunting effect. When one begins to lower the dose there is almost always some degree of rebound effect, although stopping cold will cause the classic rebound syndrome, which can be dangerous as well as unpleasant. Even tapering, one still will have some period of adjustment where the rate is higher and premature beats more frequent and/or noticeable than while on the drug. This is totally normal. At this point your only dilemma would be whether or not to halve the dose one more time, since the real question is will it make any difference. Probably it won't, but it might possibly in someone of your realtively small size, and it won't hurt to do it that way. It may not help literally, but if it only makes you feel better subjectively to taper down one more level it certainly won't do any harm. You may still expect some difference from before having taken the Atenolol, which is normal. Eventually this will level out, but can take a while. You don't appear to have any really good reason to be on the med, and if the symptoms just became intolerable you could at least resume beta blocker therapy with some experience behind you -- although if it were me I'd want a different med (say, metaprolol instead of atenolol, which seems to have a slightly higher rate of complaints of the sort it's caused in you).  I do hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please do follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Fluttering arteries or muscle spasms?",
    "content": "Hi. I am a 31 year old male who is currently being worked up by cardiologists for chest pain and erratic heart beats. I am 5' 8\" and weight 155 pounds.  I have been noticing lately that I have fluttering or erratic beat sensations in my neck and in my wrist areas right where the arteries are and I am concerned that my arteries are spasming or passing a blood clot of some sorts. My d-dimer has been somewhat elevated in the past few months and that's why I think \"blood clot.\"  Today, I was feeling my pulse on my left carotid artery and it was steady. At the same moment, I was feeling the right carotid artery and it was sputtering and beating erratically. Is this even possible to have one artery pumping at one rate and another at a different rate? Should I be concerned that this is cardiovascular or just a muscle close to the arteries? If so, I'm afraid this could cause a problem.  Please let me know if you have any thoughts on this.  Thanks so much,  Joe G\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Fluttering arteries or muscle spasms?",
    "content": "Hi there --  First, the elevated D-dimer finding is one thing and warrants further watching, but the heartbeat irregularities (palpitations) are essentially normal and routine, but do occur more often in people with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) which shows up in  your history along with anxiety, which is also frequently a corollary of MVP and does tend to increase the frequency of premature heartbeats.  About this latter (premature heartbeats, which are extremely common in otherwise normal hearts), they may originate in the upper or lower heart chambers and generally have no clinical significance even if frequent and complex in the absence of left ventricular dysfunction. We all have them from time to time, and certain things can make them more frequent (and so disturbing), including caffeine, nicotine, post-exercise relaxation, post-meal relaxation and digestion (always more frequent during digestion), stomach upsets, anxiety, certain medications, and the list just goes on and on. The important thing to bear in mind is that they are essentially innocent even in a critical setting, let alone in a healthy heart.  The fact you've been exploring possible causes of chest pain is the probable reason  for the D-dimer test, which is usually only done to determine if there has been a clot or clots present over the preceding few weeks. This doesn't mean there is one anywhere now, however, as they often dissolve on their own. Knowing if there'd been  one could be useful in preventing future ones, however, and while this is a potentially serious problem (but only if there is a clotting disorder, for which you have also probably been tested by now), heartbeat irregularities are rarely related to this and are extremely common. The only real exception would be that when lung problems exist this sometimes causes atrial fibrillation (A-fib) and A-fib can also predispose to formation of clots, although they rarely wind up in the lungs.  Your doctor is doing what seem to be appropriate tests, and would want to rule out A-fib, which is different from premature heartbeats. From your description of your palpitations it sounds more like premature heartbeats, which is far less of a concern except when it provokes additional anxiety. They become difficult to ignore in anxious people, which leads to a vicious -- but physically harmless cycle.   Your observation of a steadily beating carotid artery and a seemingly erratic radial would suggest a muscle spasm in the wrist area, something one might not normally notice if one were not trying to check one's pulse in two places at once. The carotid is always the more reliable of the two, and rarely has overlying vouluntary muscle spasm, unlike the wrist, where it happens frequently. And no, it's not possible to have two different pulses in two different arteries. The radial pulse was being obscured by twitching voluntary overlying muscle.   I hope this helps allay your concerns and perhaps answers your qeustions. Please follow up with  us here as needed. Good luck to you and please let us know what, if anything, your doctor finds.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Fluttering arteries or muscle spasms?",
    "content": "Hi,  Thanks for your reply. I wanted to update you with what was going on and see if you could provide any opinions.   An ultrasound was done on my carotid arteries and was found to be normal. Most of the spasms in my neck have disappeared, but I've had a lot of pain in my jaw and pulsating pain in my left shoulder and arm that concern me that there is still some kind of blockage going on in my arteries. I've been to the ER several times and cardiac enzymes come back normal, however I'm wondering if they can do a non-invasive test to check out my arteries.  I am also very confused as I've been to a couple different cardiologists and electrophysiologists and they have varying opinions based on looking at the same event recorder strips. What they all agree on is I have an Incomplete RIght Bundle Branch Block that occasionally shows up on EKG. Some say I might have Sick Sinus Syndrome as they've seen episodes of Tachy-Brady, but others say it's good vagal tone. I also am troubled by tachycardia everytime I go to urinate standing up, particularly in the middle of the night. My heart rate sometimes reaches 120 bpm then returns back to normal when I'm done. If I sit down and go, it stays around 72 bpm. They also recorded a brief 5-beat run of Ventricular Tachycardia that was auto-captured, but they are not concerned. I thought this was not normal and potentially dangerous?  I'm concerned something is still happening. I get a burning sensation in my mid-chest which make me short of breath sometimes that doesn't go away, even after taking liquid antacids. I do this to rule out GERD but I'm fearing that I have a blocked artery or something else going on.  Any thoughts on this? I wonder if there's something neurological going on affecting everything...  Thanks,  Joe G\n\n",

    "content": "The ultrasound (US) of your carotids is a very good indicator of the condition of the arteries in your neck, head an upper body, so that should eliminate most concerns about arterial problems. The pains you describe sound a lot more, by now, like they are either nerve related or possibly orthopedic (probably cervical vertebrae-related if so). The chest pains, as suggestve as they might be, are largely discountable as cardiac due to your having been evaluated thoroughly for cardiovascular disease.  The incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) is such a common finding among healthy people as to be virtually meaningless. It is by no means a de facto companion of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) which is fairy rare, and strong vagal tone could easily account for the bradycardia. The tachycardia of brady-tachy (SSS) is usually pretty marked and is often in the form of atrial fibrillation as well.  Finally the mild tachy during nocturnal urination -- this is extremely common in males, is often even associated with otherwise normal fainting (syncope of micturition) and one good way to avoid this problem, since the bathroom is a dangerous place to fall in, is to sit down to urinate during the night if you've experienced any lightheadedness. Otherwise is a normal phenomenon.   It would seem, due to the unusual monitoring results you've had, that you do a lot of self-monitoring and wouldn't know of these findings if you didn't do this. Since symptoms are the most importan herald of disease in most cases, I'd suggest trying to desensitize yourself, not check your heart rate so often (as hen up at night to urninate) unlss you're feeling a specific symptom. It actually sounds like you'redoing quite well.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks again, John, for your insight. It's good to know that a lot of this might be vagal tone. I did want to update you on my current diagnoses and ongoing problems.  Just last week, my electrophysiologist said that after reviewing extensive event recorder strips, he believes I have Sick Sinus Syndrome. He's the 2nd cardiologist to suggest this. He mentioned that it wasn't the type that required a pacemaker since I seem to be having what he calls \"Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia.\" The doctor noted several pauses, less than 3 seconds, where my heart might be going let's say 90 bpm and then suddenly drop to 60 bpm with no gradual slow-down. When I used to describe this sensation to him, which happens a lot when I'm first waking up in the morning, he thought that I just wasn't feeling the premature beats, but now he sees differently. He also mentioned a junctional escape beat - not sure what to make of that. He said there was also evidence of atrial component, as well, since I had runs of PACs and PAC Couplets. Some of the strips had a gradual increase in speed of the heart that went up to 170 bpm. He mentioned that it was hard to tell from the strips whether this was sinus tach with the P-waves hidden or whether it was Paroxsymal Atrial Tach with a gradual warm-up and that the only way to tell was by doing an EP study, which I'm not ready to do as of yet.  He mentioned that he believes there could be an autonomic component to this, as well. A lot of times I will get the jumps in speed when changing position. For instance if I'm go to stand up after waking up in the morning, my heart had four PVCs seperated by 5 sinus beats within a 7 second period. Sometimes I feel like my heart starts fluttering for 2-3 seconds over by my upper left ribcage area about 20 seconds after standing, but this feels like a new symptom and I am no longer wearing a monitor, so I'm scared that this might be the short runs of VT like the 5-beat run I had a year ago.   So, here's where I'm confused: I don't understand why when I feel a PVC or a PAC I feel it right in the center of my chest, but I feel most of my arrythmias in the left chest area and sometimes in different spots, where I can actually visibly see it through my t-shirt. Is there a way I can tell this? I'm also curious whether outside of having a tachycardia, whether the atrium or ventricles can just start pumping on their own at a normal rhythm. Since a lot of my symptoms happen in the early waking hours I'm concerned I'm one of those candidates for an early morning heart attack.  One of my major concerns is that my mitral valve prolapse is also degenerating. My 2007 echo (adequate quality) reported I had posterior leaflet MVP, as did my Sept 2008 echo (fair quality). Between Sept and December of 08 my symptoms got worse. When I had an echo in January of this year (Excellent Quality) and again a couple of weeks ago (Good Quality) it said \"bi-leaflet MVP\" on both - The dimensions of my left atrium also seemed to get larger over the report period, but not outside of normal ranges. I still have Mild Regurgitation with Trace pulmonic regurgitation and triscupid, but I'm concerned that there is some process going on. When I have the fast-slow arrythmias, I'll usually get a bit of pain in my left chest area immediately following it slowing down, which makes me wonder whether I'm feeling pain from pooling blood because of the sudden rate change or from the valve. I also feel a click-type sensation sometimes while my heart is beating.  I had an episode of near syncope on Sunday night where I was sitting and the room began to spin and things got dark. When I checked my pulse in my left neck, it was extremely faint. I've been walking around lightheaded ever since and my doctor thinks I have an inner ear infection. They mentioned that such infections could also cause arrythmias which makes me wonder whether that could be my problem all along since I've had this weird popping, ringing and vibrating sensation in my ear and behind it since probably last December. While doing an EMG on me yesterday the neurologist said he found some peculiar irritable muscle reactions and that it was an abnormal test, but he wasn't sure how to write it up in a report because it was that unusual. So, of course I wonder now if I have some kind of muscle disease that is attacking my heart muscle, too!  This is a lot to digest and I'm overwhelmed. Any thoughts on what to make of all this? It's depressing being told at 31 years old that I have so many problems.  Thanks,  Joe\n\n",

What you felt must have been muscle twitches(fasiculations/fibrillations). Don't worry too much about D-Dimer values.D-Dimer is not specific for DVT. It's main use is in its 'negative predictive value\".If DVT is strongly suspected, but D-Dimer is negative, it virtually rules out DVT. Trust this info is of help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi joshc45, An EKG can show changes in the hearts rhythm and changes that indicate blockage of the coronary vessels. There are two types of chest pain one is cardiac and the other is noncardiac in origin. Symptoms of cardiac type chest pain typically are described as heaviness, squeezing, tightness located over the midsternal or left chest. It typically lasts more than a few minutes, may worsen with exertion and may radiate to the jaw, neck or arms. It also may be accompanied by a feeling of indigestion, sweating, nausea or vomiting. A couple of other diagnostic studies that are used to identify cardiac causes of chest pain or blockage of the coronary arteries are a cardiac stress test and a cardiac catherization.  Some of the noncardiac causes of chest pain are stress/anxiety, Gerd, musculoskeletal strains, lung disorders, etc. I hope you find this information helpful. Best wishes!

    "content": "Hello Danny - The type of pain you describe is rarely, if ever associated with serious heart problems, although that doesn't really address your question. There are a number of less serious things that can cause this sort of discomfort, including something called costochondritis, a sometimes recurrent inflammation of the cartilege between i or more pairs of ribs. This can cause sharp, sticking type pains, and can be aggravated by certain movents, deep breathing, twisting of the torso, etc. If you can duplicate your pain by breathing or upper body movement this is almost certainly the problem. If so, something like ibuprofin (Advil or Motrin) should help.   Other non-threatening causes of sharp chest pains can be referred pain due to upper GI issues like gass or even esophogeal reflux, simple muscle irritation (as your doctor suggested, although there is no reason to say that any sort of pain would not at least possibly occur again, since whatever caused them the first time could easily be repeated later).  One benign heart condition which can also cause this sort of pain is mitral valve prolapse (MVP), which is essentially harmless but can cause any number of odd and sometimes alarming symptoms. Most people with this condition will tolerate exercise just fine, even though they may have sharp, sticking type chest pains, occasional shortness or breath, unexplained fatigue, anxiety - or none of the above.   If your pain only occurs when you are exercising vigorously it may be prudent to see the doctor again and, if it wasn't done before, at least have a 12-lead EKG done. If that were to show up anything even slightly suspicious, then an echocardiogramn would be the next step. However, it is likely that the whole question could be settled with an EKG. It sounds like a benign and non-cardiac-related problem, especially if you find it responds to something like Advil.   Good luck to you and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Im new to this site and after searching the net for  formation I found this site. Well my question is  did I screw up my heart one day. I will give information on my experience. Im a long time drug user 10 years of marijuana, cocaine occasionally, ciggerettes off-on for 10-15 years, not much alchohol since younger. I quit doing everything about 10 months ago went cold turkey on everything no smoking anything or drinking, but I relapsed about a week ago and feel horrrible that I went back to my bad habits. I was riding motorcycle and decided to stop at a friends. Well when I got there everyone was smoking pot out of a pipe so I just took it and started smoking. Well I took about 10 hits or so then was feeling high. Everyone satrted to look at my motorcycle and asking me questions about it. I started it up and trying to be cool I revved it up  several times to show them what it sounded like. Well I revved it up high rpm and felt kinda shaky after doing this. Then while sitting on the bike I startted to get bad chest pains right where my heart area is located like between my nipples. I kept thinking about it and kept thinking a vein in my heart isnt getting enough blood flow. Well this pain lasted about 1 hour and then I left feeling horrible about my situation. I felt kind of tired after I left like I almost died or somthing. After that I went to my cousins where I ended up smoking more pot. After standing up in my cousins house for around a hour I started feeling dizzy like I was going to pass out , I quickly shook my cousins hand and left before I passed out and dropped on his floor. I really think the marijuana caused me all of these problems an am worried i had a heart attack does it sound like I did? I went to the ER 2 days later cause I worried myself into going. They did an ekg and said it was normal so I don't know what the hell and why chest pains I had.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Marijuana heart attack?",
    "content": "Hi there --  Well something happened! It seems unlikely you suffered a heart attack for a number of reasons, including the fact your EKG was normal. However, pain in the center of the chest, weakness and ultimately passing out, are not okay and you should be followed up to hopefully discover the cause of this episode. While the use of marijuana did not likely cause a heart attack, it can cause a number of problems including aggravating latent heart disease, and one can have a cardiac episode without suffering damage to the heart muscle. Because of your long history of cocaine and tobacco use (much more significant than your pot smoking, although it certainly wouldn't help), you are at somewhat greater risk for heart disease than another person your age might be. Again, however, you've been clean for most of the past 10 months, so most of the risk should have disappeared by now. And while on that subject, you are to be commended for having managed that period of sobriety. Looked at objectively, you've been clean and sober for the better part of a year. Your one evening of pot smoking doesn't erase that, but is merely a small setback. What happened that night may or may not have been related, and could at least serve as motivation to avoid doing it in the future, but you don't erase all the good work (sorry 12-steppers, this is the clinical view) by going off the wagon once. I would hope you were suffiently disturbed by whatever happened to remain clean from here on out. In any case I would warn you that smoking anything during or after an episode such as you experienced is only going to make it worse, especially if it is heart of lung related. So please don't do that!   Again, while it seems less likely (due to the EKG) this was heart-related, the ER staff should have also done some blood work to help correlate with the EKG, since changes often don't show up for up to 36 hour after a coronary event, and, again, you do carry some extra risk of heart disease because of your past cocaine and tobacco use. We also don't know anything about your coronary anatomy or family history, and you did pass out, so please do arrange to have a competent cardio workup to rule out any structural heart disease. Good luck to you with all this, and hopefully you'll use this a a learning experience. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the reply. You are right the ER was going to take blood test but I denied them cause I wasnt feeling in the best frame of mind for giving blood, and it was like 2 days after I had this episode that it happened. I must tell you that I have had these episodeds before probly happening about 15-20 times since my 16 youth. I have passed out feeling dizzy and passing out after smoking marijuana. Also around a year ago I was at a party and after smoking marijuana I was standing around a fire outside I started to get chest pains similar to my pains I recently had. Well I remember having this pains in the center of my chest then I remember worring that im having a heart attack and didnt know what to do. I then got really lightheaded dizzy and blacked out. People tryed to help me up then I stood back up again only to black out again like a few seconds later. These pains im having in my chest Are in the center of my chest behind my brest plate thing and it feels like stinging or like hairs being pulled out of my chest kind of or pinching. I must also tell you about my emoitional health is not very good probably from years of drug abuse. I was recently diagnosed with schizoeffective disorder but I think im a paranoid scchizophrenic. I have problems communicating with people in the real world and somtimes I feel like people are trying to kill me. I dunno if this plays into my drug abuse and chest pains but it might, but it felt so much like I was having a heart attack.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Throat aches while walking (exercising)",
    "content": "Hello --  Given the description of symptoms, your age group, etc., I would want to rule out the possibility of exercise-induced angina, which would be consistent with your description of the onset and resolution of symptoms. This will require a comprehensive cardiological workup including resting and exercise EKG (the latter with nuclear scan) and, if suspicious, followed up by an angiogram. If all the first-line tests are negative, you may have exercise-induced acid reflux, which would be the second most-likely explanation for what's been happening. While this is annoying and should be treated if present, the most important thing would be to rule out coronary artery disease (or the more rare structural disease). You would appear to be in good shape generally, but if you're walking around with active heart disease it would be far better to know and have it handled so as to avoid eventual damage to the heart muscle. Again, what you describe is pretty classic for exercise-induced angina, which could be due to one or more narrowed arteries and can be handled fairly simply if done before something more serious happens. If this is not the case then you move on to a GI doctor and look for possible reflux disease.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm posting this here because although tests don't show anything to do with my heart I'm at a loss as to what else it could be.  I've had instances - anywhere from once a week to a few times a day - where I've had one or more of the following symptoms (in decreasing order of frequency):  1.  Tingling in the left arm, left hand, left chest and top of left foot.  Feels like someone is rolling a pincushion over my skin with all the sharp ends pointing onto my skin. 2.  Pain in left chest, sometimes dull ache in shoulder or shoulder blade.  Most commonly feels like someone is pushing their thumb into me in the area of my heart: about a 5 or 6 on a 10 point scale.  Sometimes has felt like an icepick in my chest (that sent me to the emergency room, though tests showed nothing); has also felt like someone was squeezing my heart, or poking it with a stiff finger (this also sent me to the ER - again tests showed nothing). 3.  Tachycardia - around 120 beats/minute.  This one is rare, but scary.  I've had the following tests done: EKG, traditional stress test with treadmill and 10 lead EKG.   Also X-ray and full blood work for suspected heart attack.  All results were negative.   Other miscellaneous blood work includes a full \"standard\" test - lipids (which were excellent), electrolytes, thyroid, glucose.  Everything comes back normal. On examination by a doctor, nothing seems to be abnormal in the chest, lung, heartbeat, stomach, basic neurology (reflexes are all fine).  Any ideas?  Is this heart-related at all, or is it something else, and if the latter, what are the likely culprits? Thanks for any assistance.  I'd like to stop worrying about these symptoms/spending afternoons in the ER.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Intermittent tachycardia, \"tingling\" and pain in left chest",
    "content": "Hello --  The symptoms overall don't sound cardiac-related. This, in conjunction with having ruled out heart problems pretty thoroughly, would suggest a problem in another area, possibly more than one.   The tingling sensations definitely sound like a nerve problem, especially since they are nothing like cardiac discomfort and the sensations extend to your foot. While they occur on one side of the body, this could be due to a vertebral compression of a nerve at some point -- difficult to say exactly where -- and even the chest pains could be related to something like this, but also do not sound much like they are cardiac related, and again that's been adequately ruled out anyway. I'm strongly suspicious of a vertebral compression somewhere, not sure what section, and this should be explored.   There is always the potential for what's known as co-morbidity, which simply means having more than one problem going on at the same time. It too often confuses the picture, as both patient and doctor tend to see all the symptoms as being connected even if they're not.   Finally, to address the issue of the mild tachycardia, it seems likely this is due to anxiety over the other symptoms. If it sounds too simple, that's because it is. Generally the sorts of symptoms you describe do provoke an emotional reaction and this, in turn, can cause heartbeat acceleration as well as premature (\"skipped\") beats and even temporary increases in blood pressure. All this generally just confuses the picture. Of course it could be something else, but because it's not very fast and only happens occasionally, it may warrant a not-very-urgent evaluation to make sure it's not caused by some relatively minor arrhythmia such as junctional tachycardia, which is harmless but noticeable and can often be eliminated by removing caffeine and/or nicotine from the patient's routine.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please feel free to follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 31 year old male. I exercise fairly regularly.  About 2 months ago when I was eating lunch, I noticed my heart would race whenever I swallowed the food. Ever since it has been a regular occurance, everytime I swallow food. It seems that the larger the food, the more likely an occurence. I have been sticking with soup due to this.  My regular doctor checked my blood, thyroid etc and everything was fine.  I have gone to a cardiologist and a gastrologist. The gastro did an endoscopy and found gastritus and esphogitus. He checked for a narrowing of my esophogas but only found the inflammation which was most likely caused by too much ibuprofin. He put me on Prilosec OTC for 2 months to treat the inflammation.  The cardiologist had me wear a Holter for 2 weeks. The Holter showed that my heart rate would increase for the brief moments while swallowing food. The cardiologist did a stress test, EKG, Sonogram and everything looked normal. He seemed as baffled as me.  I have been going nuts trying to figure out what is wrong with me. I feel that it doesnt make sense to me. I feel like a patient on an episode of House!  I have done some reading and learned about the Vagus nerve and wondered if that could be the culprit and if so what triggers that and how is it remedied?  Any other possible reasons that I could be suffering from this? My mind has been running wild trying to figure this out and I would love to hear something that might help put my mind at ease and point me in the right direction.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  This is a fairly common complaint and yes, especially in patients with upper GI disease (such as GERD and esophagitis) the vagus nerve can be stimulated or, more correctly, destimulated, as it tends normally to slow down the heart rate. Swallowing often can have a paradoxical effect, and the nerve is often very near the surface, so this is hardly surprising. The good news is this rarely a serious problem, just a weird feeling that one becomes used to with time. Unfortunately there's not too much that can be done for it. If it becomes problematic it can be treated, usually with beta blocker drugs. This would be unusual but can be helpful in very troublesome cases. Sometimes a bolus of food, in many cases cold food like ice cream, can trigger supraventricular tachycardia. If this starts, you'd then need to consider medical treatment to prevent episodes.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please feel free to follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

A lot depends upon the body's response in each individual, so some find a quick fix while others may struggle with this off and on for months or years. Doing anything is better than leaving it alone, however.   While I've heard a number of people state that cold food seems to trigger this especially, the size of the bolus of food really makes more sense, since that creates a direct mechanical stimulation of the vagus nerve in people prone to this.\n\n",

    "content": "i am a 35 year old man. when i was 13 i was in a car accident. the hospital took x-rays of my spine, nothing out of the ordinary was found as it pertains to the spine. although they told me i had gall stones. after having an ultrasound the true diagnosis was a calcified lypmph node. at about the age of 18 i began to have a stabbing pain in the xiphoid process area that went all the way through me. this only happened in the mornings upon waking. i would have to take very short breaths for 20-30 minutes until the pain subsided. the pain was almost paralyzing. i went to see many specialists, i.e. gastrointestinal, pychologist, physical therapist, spine specialists.  they could find nothing wrong with me. they told me the pain was in my head. so i went to a pain management clinic. they proformed a discography to try and replicate the pain. the report states \" at t8 t9 i injected 2cc. we reached a pressure of 235. pressure held at 131. there was concordant pain, severe, in the same psoition as he always feels it, and we injected then .5cc of .5%  bupivacaine with 40mg of depo-medrol. we followed that with 40mg of cefasoxime at each of the thoracic disks. the procedure ended\".   the doctor then scheduled me for radiofrequency lesioning. after the lesioning the morning pain was gone. but over the next year i have found that it is not totally taken care of. i would like to give you an example; i was in the back yard buring some brush in a fire pit. i was using a large stick to stoke the fire. i turned to the flower bed behind me to do some weeding. i knealt down to pull some weeds with the large stick still in one hand. when i stood back up something in my chest pinched causing the same pain that was discribed above but more intense. for a split second i was paralyzed and my body crumbled. as i crumbled the stick that i was carrying stabbed me in the face just above the eye. this then threw my body backwards and i hit the back of my head on the clay fire pit.  i have since seen a thoracic surgeon, because i believe this calcified lymph node is pinching nerves possibly to my diaphram. i wanted the surgeon to take the calcification out. he said he would not because the mri showed that my vena cava was wrapped around it, i could bleed out on the table.      is there anyway that this could be explored through scopes sent into the chest cavity between ribs. is it possible that some of the calcification could be removed if not all? is there any other way that this pain could be stopped? i am a construction worker and use ladders daily. if this paralyzing pain occurs when im on a 16' step ladder, i will have more problems than i wish to care about. do you have any advice for me? could this calcification be due to histoplasmosis? i do live in the ohio valley region. as you can see this has been a 23 year process with little answers to correct my pain. any help would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Well we can be pretty certain the pain was never \"in your head\" and we can be fairly certain where it was coming from, which wasn't too far from where you were feeling it. The problem now is apparently the calcified lymph node, which may or may not have been caused by histoplamosis, but I fail to see whether that would make much if any difference at this point. What I think may be needed is for your thoracic surgeon to be involved in a conference with a vascular surgeon who does a fair amount of work with the great vessels. There is some question in my mind about your vena cava being \"wrapped around\" the offending cyst. This  is a rather strange situation if the MRI's being read correctly, and the involvement of a vascular surgeon would be required to help correct this.   It would appear the problem has been isolated and identified, but there's no ready solution as things stand. You'll either have to get this corrected surgically, consider another line of work, or look at an awfully early disability. I'd certainly want to give the thoracic/vascular conference a shot first, myself, and if my thoracic surgeon was opposed to this then I'd definitely look for a second opinion or change of surgeon, since this doesn't seem like an unreasonable undertaking, at least from what I can gather. If some portion  of the vena cava is torturous it may well be part of the problem anyway, and probably should be corrected.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed. Good luck to you, and be careful out there.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  I have been suffering from severe dizziness since I had a virus in January.  It varies between vertigo, lightheadedness, and feeling faint.  (Although I have never actually fainted. I recently saw a cardiologist and he said I was either suffering from one or both of these conditions, Innapropriate Sinus Tachycardia, or Postural Tachycardia Syndrome.  These were diagnosed through a 30 day heart monitor, and a tilt table test.  Basically my heart rate was over 120, and my blood pressure was low upon standing.  I was kind of in a daze at the time, and forgot to ask a few questions I was hoping to get help with here.  1.  I have always suffered from allergies, but in the past year or so I have started having food and drug allergies.  In the middle of all of this I had an allergic reaction to a zpack I was given for the virus.  I was given an epipen to use if it happens again.  I know some people with heart conditions should not use an epipen, and I'm wondering if it's safe to use with POTS and IST.  2.  The other thing on my mind is I'm wondering if I could be suffering from low blood pressure from being inactive so long.  I am constantly dizzy, it never stops.  So it's quite disabling and I have barely been able to leave the house for 3 months.  I appreciate any answers.  I'll feel a lot better knowing about the epipen since I have no idea what I could be allergic to now.  Thanks again!!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: epipen, safe to use?",
    "content": "Hi there --  There is this thing that happens sometimes where a person will have more than one problem going on at the same time, the  Horrible Coincidence Phenomenon I've named it,  and one thing overlaps the others symptomatically and just confuses everything. Vertigo can do that. It probably is slipping in between the lightheadedness and dizziness of POTS or IST, making everything seem worse than it already is. Have you been treated (or even checked) for benign positional vertigo (BPV)? It would be helpful to know if this is present and could  be eliminated so you can  \"enjoy\" your other symptoms more clearly.   As for your specific questions, since you don't have (or there is no reason to believe you have) coronary artery disease, the Epipen is not only ok to use, but might actually improve how you feel, depending upon which of the two conditions you mentioned is actually in effect. In either case it would probably make your heart rate increase, but with IST it probably wouldn't put you into overdrive, and if it's POTS you might actuallly feel a great deal better, which would be telling (and no, I'm not suggesting you use it just to see what happens. Don't do that!).  As for the other question about sedentary lifestyle and low BP,  a qualified yes to that. It does sometimes happen,  and there have been studies which show that deconditioning due to supervised and deliberate inactivity have caused both BPV,  POTS and IST. So it is possible, and often these conditions (except BPV) are often treated not only medically but also with graduated exercise programs.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please do follow up with us here as needed and also keep us updated re: tilt table,  etc.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks so much for your fast reply!  It's really appreciated.  It makes me feel much better knowing that I can use my epipen if I need it!   I think you're right, I have a lot different stuff going on at the same time.  Guess I'm just lucky!! ;)   I have not been tested for BVP, but I am definatly going to make an appointment with an ENT doctor and get that checked out.  I have been wondering if I have something going on in my ears since my dizziness problems started in the middle of a cold.  I had one more question for you if you don't mind.  I had an episode last night that was a little scary.  My heart was racing pretty bad, and I was nauseaous with chest pain.  Well this morning when I woke up my left arm was very numb.  I'm not sure if it was related to what happened last night or if I slept on it wrong.  I did take a claritin d for my allergies last night and am assuming that might have made my heart start racing.  I have had pretty chronic chest pain and my cardiologist knows about that.  But my left arm going numb was new.  Do you think I need to get that checked out?  I will be seeing my cardiologist soon because he wanted me to try taking salt pills (thermotabs), but the pills are not agreeing with me.  So he wants me to come back to try something else to get my blood pressure and heart rate to a normal level. Again thank you for replying to my post so quickly.  It is much appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome! Yep, sounds like you're just the victim of luck (all luck isn't good I guess, but it could be worse, too). It seems even more likely there is an inner ear (labyrinthitis?) problem causing what sounds like BPV. This is a really easy check and fix if only someone  will do it. Takes about a minute and no equipment.   As for the recent nighttime episode, I would expect most likely the accelerated heart rate and chest discomfort was caused by the use of Claritin D. That \"D\" stands for decongestant, and the decongestant is almost always psuedoephidrine (basically Sudafed). That stuff is not tolerated real well by a lot of people, since it's a lot like downing a Starbuck's vente (especially before bedtime). I  suspect the numb arm was caused by sleeping position (more of that \"luck\") but of course if it recurs at a different time, during mid-day when you're up and around, you might want to have that looked at, although it would still likely be some sort of nerve problem.   Again, you're very welcome. Tell your doctor you'd like to be checked for nystagmus which is that simple \"watch my finger\" test for BPV. If your eyeballs bounce on the horizontal plane (sounds weird but trust me on this) then that's what it is, and there's over-the-counter medication that'll almost always handle that.  Good luck to you and do stay int touch.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Neurocardiogenic Syncope",
    "content": "Hello --  Since you've passed the tilt table test even with a diagnosis of NCS and since you've also had at least one ablation, I strongly suspect your main problem is a combination of intermittent dysautonomia (causing NCS episodes without prior warning) and possible an electrical problem taking place in conjunction with this. You must have at one time been diagnosed with an arrhythmia of some sort in order to have had it ablated, and it sounds as though it may still be happening. Uusally when fainting episodes are as spontaneous as yours it is due to a long  Q-T interval, and this can be managed medically but cannot be ablated. It also can be acquired due to medications being taken or some other exposure or injury. You also may be having a 2nd or 3rd degree heart block occur, which can also cause this sort of spontaneous passing out. It may well be you were diagnosed with NCS based upon symptoms and not the tilt table results, which would be a dangerously off-base way to diagnose and possibly miss somethinig more serious, since NCS is generally easy to manage. You've had a lot more episodes and a lot more injury due to faints than would be normal for someone even who passed out on the tilt table! I think you may need, first, to curtail your activities until this is clarified, as you could sustain very serious injuries (so could someone else if you're driving with this going on) and second, consider a second opinion, since there are so many more likely electrical causes of what you're experiencing that I very strongly suspect a misdiagnosis. I think you at the least have a primary problem that is electrical, in the heart's conduction system, and that this needs to be explored urgently.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you, and please be careful til you get this all sorted out. Follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Echo shows ASD, additional abnormal holter reading",
    "content": "Hello --  First, ASD is frequently associated with migraine, for reasons that are not entirely clear. It is also associated with other sometimes odd groupings of syndromes, including certain arrhythmias, again not always clearly understood. Since you were not told anything which would  explain the Holter monitor findings, this could be anything from a heart block, arrhytmia, or even some remote and unrelated ischemia due to heart coronary artery disease (please consider you have two very significant risk factors for this in your pack-a-day habit and your rather significant intake of alcohol, both of which can cause separate but often symbiotic damage to the heart aside from the ASD, which is congenital). Since the cardiology appointment was made urgently, I suspect a potetially significant arrhythmia or block (more likely) was noted, and doctor is being very responsible in wanting to get on top of it before it starts causing problems.   Please follow up with us post-cardiology consult and give us an update. We can probably give you more insights once we know what was found and why it was considered to be urgent. Good luck to you. We'll be looking to hear more soon.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: HEART ABLATIONS",
    "content": "Hello --  What you no doubt have is multiple irritable spots in your atria, may more developing over time as well, so no single ablation gets them all, or if it does more develop later. You have a pacemaker, which suggests to me you may have had an atrioventricular (AV) nodal ablation as well, but if so, you shouldn't be having these rapid ventricular responses to the atrial tachyarrhythmias. For this reason, one of two things is probably so: either you have an accessory pathyway that has not been ablated (WPW syndrome) which I doubt, since it is so easy to detect and correct, or else due to your youthfulness the doctors have not yet ablated the AV node. You could help me with this by prodiving this information. Have you had the AV node ablated? This would cause you to be fully pacemaker dependent, but it also eliminates, once and for all, the rapid ventricular response. It is sometimes put off in younger persons in order to save them numerous battery changes over a long and otherwise healthy life, but there comes a point where the whole problem is being missed this way. The only thing that can eliminate the rapid atrial rhythms from being transmitted to the ventricles is to ablate the AV node. Even then some people can still feel the atrial fluttering and racing, but only in a much reduced way, and the heart doesn't take off speeding the way yours does now. It is a rather permanent solution, but when numerous ablations fail to cure the problem this is usually what winds up being done. Since you already have a pacer and they have advanced to such a high technical degree, there's really no reason now to not do the AV ablation if arrhythmias are intractable as yours seem to be. If Betapace (sotolol) and Toprol together are not making a significant difference then I suspect AV ablation should be discussed. If it has already been done, then there's something wrong and perhaps it wasn't done completely. I can't believe it's been done if you're still having this problem. And being 100 per cent pacer dependent is no longer the big inconvenience it used to be.   I hope this helps answer your question. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here. Especially I'd like to kow if AV ablation has been done or discussed . Good lcuk to you.\n\n",

It's just as well you'll be seeing a cardiologist, as this will offer the best chance to uncover any concrete defects or problems, but my money would definitely be on nothing cardiac in nature, as this is seen so often with no explantion ever discovered. I suspect sometimes it is a muscle in the chest wall having fine spasm (fasiculation) or perhaps in some cases referred gas movement. Again, it is a very common complaint and very rarely winds up having any finding associated whatsoever. Hopefully that will be the case with you as well, and if not, it is at least very unlikely to show up any sort of heart problem.  Not impossible it could be a highly atypical symptom of an underlying problem, just unlikely.  I hope this is helfpful. Good luck to you and please update us after your cardiology consult.\n\n",

I have had the following test;  * bloods (show iron defieciency anemia, and possible Rhumatiod arthritis) * egc (normal) *holter monitor (showed palpatations however not serious) *stress test (normal- no ecg changes) *echocardiogram (normal) *angiogram of lungs to rule out clots (normal) * ultrasound of caritod arteries and brachial arteries (normal)  I would apprrecite your opinions as to whether you believe these symptoms to be cardiac or anxiety related.  every time i have these episodes i believe them to be cardiac related and not anxiety. Since all my cardiac tests so far are normal...is this all in my head??? Thanks so much\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Anxiety symptoms vs cardiac symptoms?",
    "content": "Hi there --  FIrst, there is a strong likelihood this is mostly anxiety-related; second, it is not all in your head. So...  Most of the symptoms you describe do not sound cardiac-related, and this is borne out by your cardio exams.   Sharp, stabbing pains are almost never cardiac in nature. The pain pathway involving the left armpit, shoulder, arm and  hand is one that is sometimes traveled by cardiac pain but more often it is the ulnar aspect affected, the outer part of the arm, down to the pinkie finger and is aching in nature. Pains you have, plus those in the neck, eyes and head, are often seen in conjunction with the radial pain you describe, and this is equally often GI caused and nerve-mediated. Both these possibilities should be explored, but not urgently  unless this happens so often they are really disruptive.   The abdominal pain, fullness, bloating, could be GI also, or could be  due to a faulty breathing pattern with swallowing of air (gasping, sighing, etc.). This would be consistent with a classic anxiety problem and could very well also cause the armpit-arm pain above.   Weakness in the legs could be a lot of things but is very often seen in anxious patients. The lump in the throat sensation, known as globus sensation, is a very odd,  poorly understood,but very well recognized anxiety symptom. It goes nowhere, but often just adds to the overall sense that something is terribly wrong. Shortness of breath,  while sometimes a cardiac symptom, is more often due to anxiety, and is the result of that faulty breathing that becomes part of a vicious cycle and leads often to hyperventilation, with feelings of lightheadedness, faintness, pressure in the head, fatigue, dizzines, etc., plus further sensations of inadequate breath.  Please understand these are all very real physical symptoms. I hate to hear people wonder if it's \"all in my head\", because too often clinical people will pick up on this and run with it when they should be doing a differential  diagnosis and explaining to the patient why these very real symptoms are happening and  how to work toward reducing or eliminating them.  In short (too late for that, I  guess),  I believe the odds are you have, at bottom, a generalized anxiety disorder, which does not mean  you cannot have physical ills., just like anyone else. It just clouds the picture sometimes,  which puts an extra  burden of responsibility on your doctors to differentiate and above all, explain.    I hope I've succeeded,to some  extent, in doing that here. I also disagree with the use of tricyclic antidepressants to treat anxiety, and would feel much more comfortable knowing you  were taking either one of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or, even more appropriately, one of the benzodiazepines like clonazepam, short term, with an eye toward combination with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

I have had two 48 hour holter monitors, and just completed a week with an event moniter. My resting heart rate is consistently varying from 90-120bpm. With very little exertion (Dressing my three year old twins, doing household chores) my heart rate is going up to 170bpm, when I become dizzy, nauseas and short of breath. I have had this problem since developing DCM, and each time my Cardiologist has increased my Carvedilol with no noticeable improvement. I was called today with the latest event monitor results and told I was having Sinus tachycardia with rhythms up to 180bpm. My cardiologist has told me to go back and see my GP.  I realise having sinus tachycardia is not a dangerous arrythmia, but it is really effecting my quality of life. I have young twins and am feeling constantly tired from this rapid rhythm. I've had a vast array of blood tests which have all come back normal. Is there anything I can do, or is this something I will have to learn to live with? I had thought once the DCM improved i would feel better, but overall I'm feeling just as I did when I was in heart failure.  Thank you :)\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sinus Tachycardia even after recovery from DCM",
    "content": "Hi there --  Well first, congratulations on having recovered your normal heart size and ejection fraction. This is great! It would probably easier to enjoy, however, if your heart would settle down just a little. Unfortunately sometimes after something like this (anything that involves a temporary failure of the heart muscle) there can follow a period of reflex tachycardia. While you may have to stay on the Carvidilol for a while yet to get the maximum benefit, it may be necessary to add a different, more conventional beta blocker in order to get your rate down to a tolerable level. Whether or not this would work for you depends on all the information  your cardiologist has compiled regarding your problem, but in many cases this can be done. If this isn't workable for you then it's possible a prescription by your cardiologist for at least a 90-day turn in a good cardiac rehab program  might help  retrain your heart and get things settled. Again, it's not for every person with this problem, but I have seen it work quite well.   It's true sinus  tach isn't a dangerous arrhythmia, but when it won't slow back to normal, as is somtimes the case, one of the above approaches (or a combination) might well do it. Hopefully, regardless of what can be done in the short term, this will eventually self-correct. In the meantime I hope you can arrange to get some help with caring for the little ones, as they are right now at the most challenging stage of their development they'll probably be  til  they hit their teens. It's a lot of work! I hope you'll at least run these suggestions by your doctors and that this is somewhat helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with  us here as needed.\n\n",

Last week he had all of the symptoms of Dressler's return, we went to the ER at the hospital and he got admitted over night and told that yes it looked like Dressler's had returned and was kept on the same dose of prednisone plus paracetamol and some anti-inflammatory. It is now a week later and he has been steadily getting worse, his pain is incredible and he can barely get off the couch. I don't know if we should go back to hospital as we were only there last week.Being such a rare thing these days its hard to know with Dressler's.  He has pain in his shoulder, massive chest pain,shortness of breath (to the point where he can barely talk sometimes) and a fever. Any advice would be great, thank you so much.  Cath\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Diagnosed Dressler's but don't know what to do.",
    "content": "Hello Cath,  Dressler's is very common  post heart attack, but this is being stubborn, as it usually responds well to steroids or even just anti-inflammatories. However, there seems to be more going on, and your partner needs to be under medical care to determine just what's going on. Since there was already an MI there is the potential for another, and the chest pain could indicate an unstable situation. Also, the Dressler's could  have progressed to a more serious case of pericarditits, which is at least easier to manage, as a rule, than another heart attack, and is not always serious but can be, and with the pain  and other symptoms  he needs to be seen and observed and treated and a new MI and/or pericarditis ruled in/out. If this is present overlaying Dressler's then it can be treated by semi-invasive methods if the steroids aren't working (this is usually treated same as Dressler's ,at least until it gets beyond the limits of the patient's tolerance). I'd say the current symptoms warrant rehospitalization right now, and he should be kept until stabilized.   Hope this helps. Good luck to you both and please update us here.\n\n",

    "title": "New symptoms realated to hole in heart?",
    "content": "I'm sorry if this ends up being a duplicate post but the one I did last week seems to have disappeared,   I am a 23 year old female with a a clean bill of health apart from one problem I have suffered with for as long as I can remember.  When I was born I had a tiny hole in my heart not big enough to warrent any sort of investigation and doctors told my parents that it would heal up over time. It did leave me with a heart murmur but again my parents were told that it was completley harmless and I wouldn't even notice it. However I do notice it and have noticed it for most of my life, I have noticed it for years in 2 main ways the first is palpatations just feeling like my heart rate increases as if i'm doing exersise but i'm not and the second is slightly more uncomfortable in that I get strange chest cramps that only last a couple of minutes but can be quite painful. They start off as a quick stabbing pain in my chest and then I feel as if my chest muscles on the left side lock up and force me to hold my breath. I have learnt over the years that the best way to get rid of them is however to breath through them. Ususally if I take a deep breath in I can feel things click back into palce and then it's back to normal but taking the deep breath in causes some discomfort not pain but just a weird feeling.   both of these sympotoms I've lived with my whole life and never sought medical attention for because i've just got used to them however I have developed a couple of new symptoms one of which is really annoying me.  For the past couple of weeks I have been having difficulty filling my lungs it does appear to be getting better now but I don't want it to come back so would still like your opinion. I don't have to be doing anything to feel short of breath and I find myself having to yawn constatly to try to get a satisfying breath. I have never had any lung problems or stress/nervous problems so i'm putting it down to my heart. It also gets worse when I lie on my left side and my heart rate does increase. The other thing I wanted to ask about was I have started getting a different sort of what assume is a palpatation, I feel as if my heart just skips a beat it must only last a split second but it feels like ages and my whole body feels liek its floating or sinking if that makes sense. It also makes me feel quite dizzy and I have fainted a couple of times, this is not unusual for me I've always been a fainter, but these 2 new sympotoms together are quite worrying and the breathing thing is making me really tired. If you have any ideas as to whats causing these symptoms please let me know.   Thank You\n\n",

    "title": "Re: New symptoms realated to hole in heart?",
    "content": "Hi there --  First, what you're describing I assume to be patent forament ovale (PFO), a small hole in  the septum between the upper chambers of the heart (atria). Usually this causes no symptoms and often goes undetected for years. Being younger you were born at a time when these things are routinely discovered early often before birth, but are rarely treated unless they become problematic. One of the symptoms a small PFO can cause is episodes of shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.   Some of the other symptoms you mention may or may  not be related to the PFO. For instance palpitations, even those that leave  you feelinig as though you're floating or lightheaded, are common even in totally normal people and of themselves are of no significance. However, you do describe some other symptoms which , especially in light of the PFO, should be looked at by a cardiologist so that you might have some better idea of what causes them and to have a  baseline cardiological profile, which is useful for anyone, but especially someone with a defect (no matter how minor) especially when associated with symptoms. Some of these symptoms may not be related to the PFO directly, but often more than one disorder or defect can exist in the same person, and sometimes there is a statistical relationship if not an obvious physical one.   So: the fainting is never an okay thing, and should be followed up by a cardiologist. It is most likely neurocardiogenic syncope, which for some unknown reason can occur independently or in a person who also has a PFO. There's no obvious connection, but this happens, and fainting in itself is not a desirable thing to have happen. This problem should be evaluated by tilt table test, which will demonstrate the body's inability to maintain appropriate blood pressure at certain times, and if this comes up positive it can be  treated medically or at least the patient can be coached tolearn how to anticipate and adapt to it better to avoid frank fainting. It is usually related to a failure of the baroreceoptors in he neck and the arch of the aorta, and is sometimes called dysautonomia.   The breating problems could be due to the PFO, and this definitely deserves attention too. The palpitations  are not espeically worrisome, but in someone who is already prone to fainting they can become a problem because of that.   All in all you're probably a very healthy young woman, but with some relatively minor but potentially troublesome heart-related structural problems that definitely should at least be documented and possibly treated or at least managed medically.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "For the last three weeks I've been having this flip flop feeling in my chest that has been coming and going. I was growing very concerned as I am soon going to have surgery, and have to go under anesthesia. There is no pain coming from my chest. However, I can feel the chest wall spasming to the right side of my heart. I had an ECG done, and the doctor told me that she could see BBB, but it was not quite 2 markings wide on the paper. My labs have come back normal cholesterol 164, triglyceride 43, HDL 72, LDL 83. I am wondering if BBB, which I don't know is the right or left, would cause this kind of sensation?  It only occurs when I am actually sitting down doing unproductive activities, but I can put my hand there and literally feel the muscle move. Please help, I am concerned about going through with a surgery when there might be something more serious going on.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Flip flop feeling w/ BBB",
    "content": "Hi there --  BBB (bundle branch block) looks weird whether on the left or right, and right (RBBB) is almost never of any significance, which seems the most likely finding, although it would have been helpful if your doctor had said which it was. In any case, this is unrelated to the flip flop feeling you're experiencing, which is, in all likelihood, the occasional premature contraction, or early heartbeat. These are normal and especially so at rest as you describe. The are, in general, of no significance, but when first noticed or if they become more frequent will attract one's attention and can feel scary. They are, however, harmless and diagnostic of nothing. The presence of RBBB (which I'd bet is what your doctor saw, and is also fairly common, often for no reason at all and may come and go), if, indeed, that's what it was, is also not significant. The premature beats (usually ventricular ones, PVCs), can be provoked by so many innocent things it's hard to think of them all. The reason they're common when one is just sitting and doing nothing is that the heart rate slows, and when it does these are prone to show up, because there is more room between the beats to allow them to fire off. If the pulmonary valve happens to be closed when one happens it will be more noticeable and may even feel almost painful sometimes. Still is innocent, however. Also digesting will trigger these, as will caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, stress, anxiety, etc. Just lots of causes, and the most common is sitting still of lying down to go to sleep (especially when laying on one side, usually the left).   If you can feel muscular spasms in the chest wall with your hand, that's probably not heart-related at all, and sounds like fasiculation, or twitching of voluntary muscle. That can safely be  ignored, although it may be bothersome. It can also be confused at times with premature heartbeats or other palpitation, which it is not.  In  short, as weird as they feel these are harmless. The BBB, presumably right,  would not be related and if it is RBBB is meaningless. LBBB is usually seen with more complex  problems that you don't seem to have and which would have drawn a reaction from your doctor. Also, your lipid profile (cholesterol) is great. The BBB, whichever side, is pretty narrow, so may not even be true BBB. If the doctor finds no significant abnormalities then you've been given cardiac clearance for the surgery and should have no problems in  that regard. I hope this is helpful. If you have any further questions please follow up with us here. Good luck to you and do update us after the surgery.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  I am a 26 year old female - 5'2, 105 lbs.  No previous health issues.  Family history:  uncle died @ 52 from heart attack, half-brother had minor heart attack @ 43 (although he smokes & drinks as much as possible..), grandmother died of heart attack @ 75.   For about a month, I have been having chest pain that comes and goes - and varies in type of pain.  Sometimes it feels like a dull ache in upper left chest, sometimes it is a sharp spasm type of pain (that lasts only a few second to perhaps a minute or so), sometimes it is a sharp pain lower, near top of ribs.  In the past few days, my left arm has been aching.  The pain does not seem to change with, and is not brought on by activity (walking or going up strairs). I don't have any shortness of breath.  I went to a cardiologist a few months ago (pre-chest pain) because I was having heart palps.  Blood work & echo normal.  EKG prints as \"abnormal\", but cardiologist thinks normal enough for me - perhaps some variation due to hormones - plus, every time they do an EKG I am on the verge of a panic attack with heart racing (had similar EKG year and half ago).  Sometimes my heart races for no reason (seems like seperate issue from chest pain?) and cardiologist thinks \"innapropriate sinus tachycardia\" which she says is not dangerous, just uncomfortable.  Suggested \"pill in pocket\" method of treatment -beta blocker- if I have an episode that becomes unmanageable- I have not taken any of the meds to date.   I am scheduled for a stress-echo in 3 weeks - cardiologist wants to do for my peace of mind (I used to exercise 3X per week - 2-3 miles and since palps began am too nervous to jog).  anyway, I am frankly scared to death that I am going to have a heart attack from these strange chest pains and now the arm aching.    As additional background: about two years ago I had mild chest pain and left arm pain - went to urgent care facility - they did EKG and sent me to ER (because EKG showed same \"abnormal\" read) - I spent 6 hours in ER (they did CT scan to rule out blood clot) and then they just monitored me for a while (I was having extreme anxiety about the whole thing)- finally sent me home.  I went to a cardiologist the next day for follow up Echo and EKG which were supposed to have been normal.  Then I had no symptoms for about two years until present.  Today, I called the cardiologist's office to see if they could fit me in with Dr. -  talked to nurse instead.  I explained the pain and she thought it sounded like muscle or pinched nerve pain and suggested taking aspirin or advil and see what happens.  I'm still scheduled for stress-echo in 3 weeks.   As I said, I am very frightened that I am going to have a heart attack.  I realize that my fear my be a little irrational given my age, but still... any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear titlegirl,  In your case, given the lack of major risk factors for coronary disease (i am not sure whether we should consider your half brother as a positive family history given the fact that he is half a brother and given the fact that he is a smoker), and your chest pain characteristics, the probability that this pain is due to coronary disease is quite low.  The pain that you are having might be due to a problem in the spine of your neck or a muscle problem. There are other potential causes in your case as well such as mitral valve prolapse (benign condition that should have appeared on the echocardiogram but since it did not appear on the echocardiogram then you most probably don't have it). The sensation of palpitations sometimes can present with chest pain or discomofort. Anxiety attacks can somtimes present also with chest pain.  To have the peace of mind, it is not a bad idea to have the stress echocardiogram, but the probability that it will turn out positive in your case is very miniscule, meaning that there is nothing to worry about.  In the meantime, if your thyroid functions have not been already checked, i suggest you have them checked.

A few months after I started using birth control, I started having near blackout spells while sitting on the couch and my heart rate would increase and I would have palpitations.  It scared me to death and the first time I had a CT done on my heart to rule out blood clots(which came back normal).  A month later it was still happening and one time I went to the emergency room and they did blood work which was normal.  They also gave me a 24 hr heart monitor to wear.  Result were sent to a cardiologist to read.  It was normal because I didn't have any symptoms during the 24 hour period.  The cardiologist thought it could be SVT and ordered a stress test and a long term heart monitor.  The stress test was normal.  I had also had several EKG's done around this time.  The only abnormality the doctor found was like you \"inappropriate sinus tachycardia\".  He also said I had an \"abnormal\" heart rhythm but that it was probably normal for my heart, just statistically abnormal.  I stopped taking birth control and I haven't had any other \"episodes\" but I still have palps occasionally.  But since then I have starting having left arm pain.  It has been present everyday for the last 2 months or so.  Some days more painful than others.  It feels kinda like it could be muscular but I'm not sure if it is related.  I saw your post and it seems very similar so I was wondering what currently is going on with your health now.  It has been 3 years, so did your pain go away?  Did you experience anything else?\n\n",

Last year I had several days in a row where my heart was constantly \"off\".  My holter monitor showed I was \"throwing pvc's\".  My cardiologist said hormones, anxiety and prescribed klonopin.  I did not take the meds, because I knew it was not anxiety.  Two weeks ago, my heart started skipping regularly and I passed out.  The nurse who was with me at the time said I was in \"Afib\".  My heart felt like it was vibrating it was beating so fast and very irregular.  Echo showed enlarged heart, bicuspid and tricuspid valve regurg, and pulmonary hypertension.  Echo stress - walked 2 minutes, heart rate was 168 and bp was 168/100.  They stopped me, prescribed Digoxin,  and sent me home until my follow up.  It has now been almost 2 weeks and the symptoms are the same, but I haven't passed out again.  Rapid heart rate with any movement at all, skipped beats, etc.  Blood test show low potassium, low vitamin d, low calcium.  Thyroid level is normal.  My question is - what does all this mean?  The cardiologist spent less than 5 minutes in the room with me before prescribing a drug and walking out - i tried to ask him more questions, but he was \"busy\".  What questions do I need to ask to find the right way to treat whatever it is that I have wrong?  Is there anything you suggest I do?  I am scared and really need to know what the next step should be.  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  Wow, there's a lot that deserves addressing, and I have to admit to being pretty disappointed with the doctor in question. This  isn't funny stuff, even when it's not life-threatening. Some of the symptoms are even normal, or at least minor (PVCs are extremely common and not diagnostic of anything, but they can at least draw attention to things that are not right). But it's awful to have to deal with when you have no information to work with.  I'll try  and help by going down the list and maybe you can make a list and go back and smack it down on his desk -- or do something to get his attention for a few minutes. Here goes:  Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is commonly associated with a lot of the symptoms you've experienced. Usually this is coincidental, but it also sometimes becomes a catch-all, as does anxiety, something also often associated with MVP for reasons that are unclear. (By the way, the Klonopin, in this case, might actually help things work a little better, even though you are right,  there's structural stuff going on and it's not caused by anxiety but probably the cause of it). Still, there's a lot left to know: First, how severe is the mitral  regurge, if there's any (and it would seem there is). Second, what degree of regurge is present in the other  valves? Next: does the doctor feel Digoxyn is effective against your A-fib? (We know it often is in general). And with that, should you be on an anticoagulant or is the A-fib just intermittent? Why is your potassium low, and  should you be  prescribed a supplement to help control the arrhythmias? (This is often a big contributor to this stuff, and at best it's not helping). What is the degree of heart enlargment and what can you expect from that in the future?   Most of this is fairly common  stuff, but deserves an explanation in context of the findings. You deserve an analysis. But the one thing that especially deserves attention is the finding of pulomnaary hypertension, which can be quite serious and absolutely deserves further exploration and/or a very clear explanation. This is not something one mentions in passing then walks out of the room.   If you're unable to get a satisfactory response from  this cardiologist then you absolutely are warranted in seeking a second opinion. The stress test (the heartreate and BP) seems normal, so I'm wondering why the test was interrupted. You may be in realtively good shape, but if these things are not carefully examined and explained, you have very good reason to be concerned. It's time to be aggressive about this.  If it turns out to be less than serious it's still going to be a huge nuisance and will deserve medical management. I hope this will be helpful to you. Good luck and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  If, in fact, you did have a TIA, or if your doctor even feels fairly certain you did, then these are generally considered \"warning\" events, so yes, you definitely should let your doctor know you're having what seem to be related symptoms (the tingling down your arm). Usually the purpose of treating a TIA is to avoid a \"true\" and damaging stroke.   On the other hand,  high blood pressure is rarely the  cause of TIA, but rather clots cause these and usually lead to the larger stroke. Of course if there is a weakened blood vessel, then this is a potentially more serious situation that demands close followup,  and again,  yes, by all means let your doctor know you're having these symptoms.   I have a feeling this may all be something else entirely, but we don't have enough information to draw too many conclusions. Could you tell us what your blood pressure range is currently? This might  be helpful, along with  what's been prescribed to control BP (and isn't working)?   Please folow up with us but first give your doctor a call about the symptoms you're having. Hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

There was one time that my husband said my lips were turning blue and he actually had to breath for me and that seems to ease the pain somewhat. These attacks last anywhere from 20-40 minutes but the dull pain continues for about an hour.Thank you for any information you may be able to provide\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  First you need to be seen by a doctor who's interested in taking care of you. Blowing this off as anxiety without any testing or a comprehensive exam is a very bad idea. While it's possible this is anxiety based, the chances are even if it is, it's having a fairly strong effect on you at the time it happens. It doesn't sound like any of the classic anxiety-based cardiac syndromes.   You may be having episodes of ventricular bigemeny, which would seem to cut your regular heart rate roughly in half (although a monitor would pick up all the beats, but would show the beats to be closely coupled every other beat -- a benign but somtimes painful event). This could also account for the shortness of breath, since if bigemeny is timed (through luck  or some odd factor) so that the premature beats fall when the pulmonary valve is closed, it makes the effectively slowed heart rate feel like the beat is very strong and also takes one's breath away. This doesn't happen every time, but in some people, depending upon the trigger, it can be a common occurrence. The beats then make the chest feel tight and almost painful, and in someone as slim as you are, this is all the more noticeable.  This is but one possibility, and while it is essentially benign, if it's even temporarily disabling it needs medical management. If it's something else (and I'm not sure what it might be, because your doctor didn't do even the simplest tests) then it needs to be identified via 12-lead EKG, possibly echoardiogram, and  some blood work.  All this should have been done upon your first visit. If this doctor won't take the time to make certain what's going on then you'll need to find another one who will, preferably a cardiologist, who would have a proprietary interest in solving the mystery and getting you feeling normal again. Two years of this is way too long to have to worry about what it might be.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   I should start by saying I am 22 years old I weight about 182lbs roughly and am about 1 cm shy of 6 feet tall, (I smoked off and on from nov 04 - feb 06 when I quit and have not smoked since could that have caused any damage?) So I no longer smoke, I do not drink never have. And my life style is admittedly very sedentary.   About a year ago I started experiencing elevated heart rates, though it is quite possible I had them before simply did not notice them at the time as from 2006 and on my main fear from my anxiety disorder was my heart, so when it happend I felt very hot suddenly shakey. and my heart rate shot up to 170 beats per minute and took roughly 2 hours for me to calm down and for my heart rate to once again drop below 100 bpm and go back to normal. I had several (3-4) more of these and I contacted my doctor- Whom only 1 month prior had given my yearly phsyical which for the first time included an EKG as I asked for it due to my own fears. It came back with a BPM of 114 but with a NSR and everything looked fine.  So when I went back in to see her she used a device to take my pulse and listened to my heart for several minutes and took my bp which was of course high (I am very nervous when I have tests done) and after all that she had a long talk with me and my father, she upped my xanax dosage which was before these events only 1/2 a mg a day to 2mg's with a slow increase and allowed me an extra 1mg if needed for bad episodes and I brought up beta blockers and CHB's to her, She said beta blockers were something she was considering but did not wish to push on me , but she also thought them worth a shot as the one she prescribed she said (Toprol) Had the effect of reducing symptoms of the Fight or flight response (panic attacks) and it would keep my heart rate under control since that was a main worry of mine and still is. I was originally on 25 mg and that was reduced to breaking the pill in half. I had a follow up with her in Sept of 07 and things seemed ok then also pulse at the visit earlier that year was 103 pulse checked at this visit was 90 which during an anxiety episode is a good improvement at least to me I think. (since starting Toprol I have only had 3 time when my heart rate exceeded 140 and they never lasted more then 30 minutes that I can THINK of.)  My questions are straight forward - Does this drug put me at risk for heart failure? because lately I have been feeling like my heart is beating .. Weaker? I used to always be easily aware of it and now that is quite hard to do.   Do these episodes seem like anxiety or panic related or more related to something like SVT ?  I also get these.. heaving like feelings in the center of my chest sometimes And I was curious if these are indicative of anything heart related.  Do you think another EKG is warranted and what would you say in your opinion is my over all cardiac risk for heart failure / disease / attack and can my medications lead to or cause it?  I would ask my doctor these questions but as my insurance company and I are having some problems this is the only place I could think to turn to.  My past history includes Diagnoses from 2001-present for GERD and Panic Disorder and Chronic Anxiety.  Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Blackrain,  There are several reasons for a fast pulse rate. More common of these are Anxiety, panic, fever, low HB, SVT, atrial fibrillation, Hyper Thyroidism, pregnancy, etc. The list goes on but these are the frequently encountered ones.  Now, your EKG showing NSR means that Atrial fibrillation and SVT are automatically ruled out. I take it, you don't have frequent fevers and your HB is normal. I am sure you can't get pregnanat [lol !] hence we are left with thyroid and anxiety. I just feel anxiety is the root cause of your predicament.  Toprol [metoprolol] is one of the treatment of heart failure and it cannot be the reason of it.   I suggest you do a lot of aerobic exercises. This will condition your heart and increase the vagal tone which will reduce the heart rate. Vigorous exercises will also divert your mind to some purposeful activity and reduce the anxiety.  Exercise also induces secretion of beta endorphins from the hypothalamus in brain which induces a sense of well being, euphoria and stimulates the immune system!   Apurva\n\n",

I did what I could to monitor the rate itself. It never seemed to beat unevenly. Just VERY fast. no skipped beats that I noticed.    So is it possible anxiety and panic caused this?

    "title": "Re: Worries of heart rate And Heart Failure",
    "content": "Hi Blackrain99 -  I'm following up on open questions in this topic and having read through the whole thread here I am pretty well convinced your symptoms are anxiety mediated. Although a rate of 170 is very unusual for sinus tachycardia, it can happen, especially in people who already have a lot of adrenaline loose in the bloodstream and a higher-than-normal resting rate. While there is a remote possibility that your rapid rate is due to a tacharrhythmia such as atrial flutter or juntional tachycardia (the former requires some attention but is not extremely serious and usually never goes much over 150; the latter is more annoying than anything else; both are pretty regular, whereas atrial fibrillation is extremely irregular), it seems, given all the facts you've provided, that it is unlikely anything but an extreme response to intense anxiety.   Are you currently taking Toprol on a routine basis? One of the things I've learned is that unless doctors specifically educate their patients about beta blockers, people tend to lapse into only taking them when they perceive a problem, then stop when it appears to be corrected. Stopping a beta blocker, or taking one only intermittently, can actually cause a rebound effect which will aggravate the very problem you are seeking to solve. Just a thought.  The fact that your doctor was examining you during a rapid rate episode at last visit and didn't feel it necessary to perform an EKG would suggest she feels there is nothing to be revealed that way, that the heart is essentially healthy, but just running at a rate that's uncomfortably fast. This is where beta blocker therapy comes in handy, although you could of course be suffering from an overactive thyroid. Has this been checked?   I noticed also, earlier on, that you asked about Toprol making the heartbeat \"weaker.\" In a sense, the answer is yes, but not in a bad way. What beta blockers like Toprol do is to block the body's uptake of adrenaline, a stress hormone that can make the heart beat faster and harder. The drug is used for a lot of different heart-related things, including blood pressure reduction. It accomplishes this by not only slowing the heart rate but also by reducing cardiac output -- in effect making the heart beat less vigorously than it would otherwise. This is a good thing as a rule, since the overall overactivity of the heart is far more noticeable to the patient, and usually makes one more anxious because of this awareness. So while it does decrease the force of the beat somewhat, it is bringing it more into line with what it should actually be, and that's all to the good.  If you take a beta blocker intermittently or stop it abruptly, this definitely can cause a very unpleasant response wherein the heart will start beating a good deal faster than before, and the force will also be noticeable. In addition, because of the uptake of adrenaline, one may also feel quite anxious when this happens.   You've been on a very low dose of Toprol, but hopefully you are taking it as prescribed, which is every day, not just \"as needed.\"  Please keep in touch, and I hope this finds you feelng well.\n\n",

I became suddenly light headed, so light headed I had to lay on floor, felt \"spacey\" and felt like heart might stop, also had profuse sweating as if I just got out of a shower.   I had a reveal loop monitor implanted a year ago but never another episode as described above.  I too have had tachycardia at rates over 170 bpm.    My heart tests reveals all four valves are slightly leaky, stage one ventricular dysfunction described by my electrophysiologist as mild thickening.  I am on 200 mg of Flecainide a day, one cartia XT 240 a day.  I also have dual av nodal conduction.  ECG shows no evidence of MI, however my first ECG following an \"episode\" showed a past MI, my heart doctor thought it was misread  First Heart Institute said there was nothing wrong, just drink Gatorade, said I was dehydrated.  Second Heart Institute gave diagnosis above as well as a failed tilt table test and a diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension.  I also have a hole in my heart.  Yesterday I asked my doctor about the heart wall thickening and he said it is nothing to worry about, however all my research seems to contradict that statement.  My mother has CHF, atherosclerosis and heart muscle weakening diseases.    My question is this, could my recurrent childhood pneumonia's (annually from age 15 months to age 9) caused this heart wall thickening?  And how can this not be significant considering my familial history of serious heart disease.  I still have heart runs up to 140, I'm still aware of my heartbeat.  I am exhausted all the time with mild exertion.  My concern is I'm not getting good advice, possibly due to being a \"hands on \" patient or the fact that I am on medicare and medicaid.  Please help before it's too late.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello--  It's a pretty mixed bag you've been handed, opinion-wise. I'll try to not make it more complex but perhaps simplify it a little with any luck.  First, those episodes you describe sound like orthostatic hypertension but more likely vasovagal syndrome, also called neurocardiogenic syncope syndrome. While benign, it can certainly be upsetting and frightening, and it is often seen in people (more women then men) with patent foramen ovale (PFO), likely the hole in your heart you referred to, a small opening that normally closes in utero, but sometimes is incompleted. This usually has no symptoms associated with it, but it can sometimes, for unclear reasons, cause or at least be associated with symptoms such as you describe. It's rarely repaired anymore. With neurocardiogenic syncope problems you can often also have inappropriate sinus tach (IST, which it seems you  do at times). It's also pretty unsettling.   I always will take issue with Flecainide, especially when I'm not sure, as with you, exactly what it's supposed to be doing. Usually it's only used for control of atrial fibrillation anymore, and otherwise isn't a real good idea. There are other far more effective and safe medications to help you manage what seems to be going on. I'd really badger the doctor about the puropose and wisdom of Flecainide.  Some slightly leaky valves are often normal. Stage One ventricular dysfunction is a very vague finding, but should at least be followed up. The dual AV nodal conduction (AVNRT) is something worth consideration as far as possible ablation, as this often will correct a lot of the other problems and is routinely done now, as it is the most common cause of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) which you have been told you don't have but seem to be being treated for anyway. This is puzzling. The finding of old MI is often in error and needs to be redone and looked at again with a critical eye, but chances are that was a mistake, as it is one of the most common misreadings done by EKG machine computer readings. Turns up all the time.  As for the childhood pneumonia: it could have had some deleterious effects back at the time, and they may have remained with you for a long time now without anything getting worse. What happens then is we just get a baseline picture of the heart's health as an adult and follow it with that considered. Again, it could account for some of the valve and thickening issues, but it's not something that's usually progressive. You have some congenital issues that could be better dealt with though, and maybe a change of doctor or second opinion might be helpful. I'd really like to know, though, the rationale for the Flecainide. Please follow up with us here espcially if you can get some answers about that.  Good luck to  you.\n\n",

    "content": "My electrical study showed the dual av nodal conduction and inducible atrial flutter.  My cardiologist said that ablation would result in my needing a pacemaker, because of the failed tilt table test.  I began on Flecainide last summer, during which I still had episodes of tachycardia with some SVT happening so in August they added the cartia XT240.  My last recorded episode was in December at 140 bpm.  Yesterday they removed the reveal loop monitor.  My son was with me and noticed that my heart rate got down to 62.  Now I'm worried the medications are causing bradycardia.  I asked the P.A. and he said that I didn't need to worry about that.  Unfortunately, this is my second opinion.  I felt better about the diagnosis than the first who virtually said there was nothing wrong with my heart.  Lately though, I'm thinking that this Flecainide could be messing me up worse.  I'm always tired, have no energy and extremely blurred vision.  I have thought about requesting an appointment at Mayo as there are no more options in the town I live in.  It is hard to know what to think when a doctor tells you there is nothing structurally wrong with your heart but tests reveal that there is.  What's stranger still, I only had one episode of heart problems when I was 29 and it was atrial fib/flutter??.  This episode is what led me to my first cardiologist who said I had Mitral Valve Prolapse and the flutters were simply regurgitation.  I accepted that, probably because nothing happened with my heart again until last year.  I too expressed my concern about taking Flecainide and initially refused to start it until I had an episode that took me up to 178 bpm.  I began it out of fear and now I fear it is causing further damage to my heart.  I have read the literature, I am a college graduate, however I keep being told not to worry about it.  Is it true that with my condition an ablation would make a pacemaker necessary?  Is the combination of calcium blocker and arrythmic agent causing this bradycardia?  Can it also ultimately lead to more severe heart problems, including CHF?  I think my doctor's feel it's best not to reveal everything because with my heart problems I have had extreme anxiety as well which of course, exacerbates my symptoms.  What, as a cardiologist would you suggest as treatment or followup?  Thank you, Mary Ann Lincoln, NE\n\n",

    "title": "Sometimes hard to breathe after normal treadmill walk",
    "content": "This morning I had breakfast (cereal w/ milk) and went upstairs about an hour after eating to do my newish exercise, walking on a manual treadmill.  I started doing this in February for 3 weeks, did not do much in March and just picked it up again in April.  I walk .5 to .75 miles at 1.5 to 2 mph at 1st incline level.     I quit smoking after 25 years in July and had a scare with a couple of panic attacks in late September that sent me to the ER and a cardiologist.  My stress test was normal and ECG.       I am 46 and wear a wrist heart rate monitor.  I am generally in the high 70s before and try to not go much above 122 as I was pretty sedentary for the last 10 years.  I had been getting pretty confident because I wasn't having any trouble and then today with a heart rate around 120 about 14 minutes into my 20 minute walk I was sweating.  I kept going because I thought with my heart rate okay it was possibly (sorry for this) I felt not right because I hadn't had my morning BM yet.       Normally after walking my heart rate goes down quickly to the 80s and did again today, but I felt slight discomfort in my chest, but not like a weight.  More in the muscles on the inner part of my breasts.     I laid down and didn't really feel good again for at least an hour.     I am wondering if my pre-diabetic condition affects my new exercise and if I should have waited longer before exercising.  I have some endometrial swelling and wonder if (about 4 days to period) this somehow affects my exercise if I haven't had a BM yet.  Or what else could have caused this \"not-right\" feeling?     I wondered if maybe my blood pressure dropped or something.       Before the panic attacks in September I rode my bike outside for too long on 2 occasions and the first time I was great and the next week I had the same reaction riding the same distance.  This is why I got the heart rate monitor.       I am 5'6\", weight 150 and am 46.  My blood pressure since quitting smoking is around 120/78 or 80 unless I am at the doctors where it shoots up.  I have lost 10 pounds and am trying to lose 15 more to stop the possible diabetes.   Any insight you can give me is appreciated.  I return to the cardiologist in the Autumn for a follow-up.                   Thanks, Nora\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sometimes hard to breathe after normal treadmill walk",
    "content": "Hi Nora,  First let's sort out the various possible factors and non-factors. You have been diagnosed as pre-diabetic, meaning your fasting glucose has been, on at least two consecutive occasions, between 100 and 125. This won't affect anything much. You've also had some panic attacks fairly recently. This can cause a whole host of misleading symptoms which are quite real, but not especially telling. We should save this fact for future reference. You started your exercise program briefly in February, stopped after three weeks, then resumed recently. This could account for a lot of inconsistencies in your response to exercise. You also use some incline in addtion to a pretty conservative rate and distance. You smoked  for 25 years, but have quit for almost nine months now and the panic attacks followed your early cessation of smoking. Your resting and working heart rates are both very reasonable and normal for conditions. You've had a normal stress test and resting EKG. Your recent disturbing episode followed not feeling right because of not having had the usual bowel movement. Your height and weight are within normal limits and yields a normal body mass index (BMI). Your primary complaint involves some mild, atypical chest discomfort following exercise, taking all  the above into consideration.  So then: what does this look like? First impression would be likely anxiety-mediated chest discomfort related to inconsistent exercise program, long-term smoking history and  possible lower GI bloating. Most likely this was innocent.   However: given your age, smoking history and inconsistency in exercise tolerance, my advice would be this: resume the exercise program, remove the  incline for a while, and if this response should happen  again, go to the ER directly, instead of lying down and resting first. Although I strongly suspect this is innocent,  it's difficult to analyze symptoms alone in an adult woman, since heart disease symptoms often present atypically and prediabetes can actually represent metabolic syndrome in some cases. So while I think it's both ok and beneficial  to resume the exercise program, if you have the same thing occur again under the same circumstances,  it would  be prudent to have yourself checked while this is happening. Chances are it will turn up nothing, but I don't believe in taking chances.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with  us here as needed.\n\n",

I have these too but her's are much worse. Worse in that they can sometimes last for hours, non-stop. She has them almost every day. We think they are stimulant related but they're very troublesome. She was taking Prilosec for a time and her flutter would last half a day or longer. Her doctor said Prilosec could do that and when she stopped, the episodes decreased somewhat. She had a resting EKG about a year ago and the doctor told her it was not a normal EKG but may be normal for her. She had a stress test a month ago which was normal. She also has GERD and possibly a Hiatal hernia. Her cardiologist doesn't seem to be concerned but would not prescribe a beta-blocker or anything for palpitations. His reason was that these medications may cause more problems than benefits. I know her cardiologist and he does not like to prescribe medications unless absolutely necessary, which I really like. Her regular doctor isn't worried about it either but still, this causes her a lot of problems and worry. Should she get a second opinion?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Frequent Heart Flutter",
    "content": "Hello --  While we don't know exactly what's causing the palpitations (what sort or sorts of arrhythmias your mother is feeling), it appears they are benign, which is usually the case. However, they can cause tremendous anxiety in the person feeling them, and this is often reason enough to treat with a low-dose beta blocker. The idea that these \"cause more problems than benefits\" is not generally true anymore. When only non-selective beta blockers were available some of those could cause pronounced lethargy, at least early on, as well as to aggravate asthma or COPD. (And if your mother is such a heavy smoker that she has been already diagnosed with COPD, this may be a reasoning factor for witholding beta blocker therapy). However, since the introduction 25 years ago of cardioselective beta blockers (in particular metaprolol) the annoying side effects are usually minimal if any at all, and the medications are now available in very low doses (from 12.5 mg. on up). If the palpitations are causing your mother a great deal of discomfort and anxiety, and if her doctors won't prescribe low-dose beta blocker therapy for her, she certainly would be within her rights to seek a second opinion. While most doctors see even very frequent premature heartbeats as inconsequential, I think sometimes they lose touch with the fact that these are a major cause of severe anxiety and even social isolation due to the fear and anxiety they produce.   Further, I have to disagree with your mother's doctor about palpitations being attributable to Prilosec use. There is nothing in the literature to this effect and nothing in the medication that would logically lead to triggering premature heartbeats or other arrhythmias. This sounds more like a distraction method, and if she has GERD/hiatal hernia she should be taking something to help counteract the effects of that. Almost none of the medications dedicated to treating those symptoms have any ability to provoke palpitations.   Of course it goes without saying they would probably reduce in frequency if she were to stop smoking, and would also add years to her life. That and losing excess weight together would make her a far healthier person, but the palpitations, while they generally have zero diagnostic significance, could cause her to become more withdrawn and worried and actually add to the unhealthy habits she's already adopted, so I really do think (unless she has severe COPD) a low-dose beta blocker could help her to feel less anxious, cut down on her worry and maybe even encourage her to work on the other aspects of her health that are technically more important to her having a long, healthy and enjoyable life.  I hope this is helpful to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "In 2001 I went to the ER with heart attack symptoms, including a dull ache or slight burning in the extreme upper left chest, and a tingle or slight burning in the left forearm and the heel of the left hand. EKG was okay, some subtle aspect of the timing resulted in an echocardiogram and a cardiac catheterization, which were fine. Symptoms persisted all 36 hours I was in the hospital. I went home, took Ibuprophen and an antihistamine, and the problem went away.  This spring the exact same symptoms arose, accompanied by a brief hot sweat, anxiety, and occasional heart flutter (to be expected, I suppose). I went back to the ER, and the EKG was fine. Potassium was low. Neither mild exertion nor pressure affected it. Symptoms persisted a couple of days, Ibuprophen helped. I decided I had carried something heavy with my left arm immediately prior.  This summer I had a migraine, with the classic jagged lines, on the left side. It lasted only about twenty minutes, but I\u2019ve never had a migraine before. An MRI looked fine, but blood work revealed a CRP of 28. Augmentin was prescribed.  Soon after, while traveling, identical left side and arm symptoms recurred. The doctor felt it might have been muscular, and after a couple of days of Paracetamol it went away.  Now it\u2019s the fall, and it\u2019s happening again. It certainly could be muscular, but it seems like there\u2019s an occasional heart flutter or dizziness, but it could simply be anxiety. It does seem to be helped by Ibuprophen. My CRP is now 18.  The only other symptoms I can think of are I have a long-term history of a bad tooth on the lower left side that I really should take care of, as it occasionally aches. And I am overweight, and was once diagnosed with fatty liver, although my liver enzymes have been fine for several years.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While your pain pattern should have sent you to an ER initially, you've passed most all the evaluations with flying colors, so it would seem heart involvement is pretty much ruled out at this point. Still the problem recurs periodically. While  the palpitations and other ancillary symptoms probably are anxiety-related, the basic syndrome remains, and you are undertandably concerned.   The pain could be one of two things (just offhand): it could be a recurrent inflammatory problem, perhaps of a nerve, or it could also be one of the odd symptoms we sometimes see with mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVPS -- the syndrome can exist even without any evidence of actual prolapse). Often pain similar to what you describe occurs in people with this problem, which is benign. What makes this slightly more likely is that MVPS is also frequently seen in association with chronic anxiety or panic disorder, with occasional palpitations and other autonomic misbehaviors such as flushing, lightheadedness, etc., and also in some patients there is also optical migraine. Since all these seem to be grouped in your case, this may well be the underlying problem.  I notice you're already taking a healthy dose of metaprolol, and wonder why that was prescribed, as it is often given to mitigate symptoms of MVPS.   Given your history and good cardio test results, not to mention the metaprolol, my best guess would be MVPS, with or without evidence of actual prolapse. It's benign, but it does carry with it the occasional cluster of oddball symptoms much such as you describe.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks you for your response. It has taken quite a while to resolve this situation, and I wanted to update you on the combination of causes. In November and December I had complete cardiac workups including stress tests, nuclear imaging, and a carotid ultrasound. No problems were found.  CRP remained elevated, with occasional left side pangs, dull right abdominal pain on occasion. An MRI revealed nothing. A colonoscopy revealed diverticulitis, apparently not too severe. One benign polyp was removed. A CAT scan also showed diverticulitis, and a fist sized abscess connected to the colon. I was sent to the emergency room and admitted. The surgeon was astounded that I'd had no symptoms related to the colon. He suggested the right side pain was gallbladder related and had a sonogram done that showed two small polyps. So while I was opened up to remove several inches of colon and the abscess, he also removed the gall bladder. Everything was benign. It turned out the gallbladder was completely non functional.  I'm still recovering from the surgery, but it seems clear that some combination of these problems was causing the elevated CRP and certainly the gallbladder was causing the right side pain. Whether the left side pain was referential from the abscess, or caused by low potassium, I don't know. (While in the hospital I learned that one of my hypertension medicines, a diuretic, drains potassium.)  In the final analysis, I'm glad I stuck with the search and insisted upon the CAT scan, as although the problem was asymptomatic, I understand it was potentially very dangerous. Thank you for you help, and for maintaining this forum.\n\n",

I also have high cholesterol (Total-462, LDL-370) and borderline high blood pressure (132/81). Two years ago I began having the occasional palpitation (maybe 3 or 4 per wk) about 8 years ago. About 2 years ago the palpitation increased and I even had a few episodes that lasted 15-20 minutes. I wore a Holter Monitor and the PVC's were confirmed. I then had a resting EKG, which was normal. Then a stress with no symptoms. Then an Echo-cardiogram which was normal. Then a Cardiac MRI, which was also normal. All of the testing was done within a month or so of onset of my extended PVC's.  Starting about 6 months ago, I began to have very noticeable pain in the center of the chest and slight dizziness with very strenuous exercise such as walking up a steep hill or lifting heavily. Within 1 or 2 minutes of rest, the pain disappears and I begin to feel better. Even after the symptoms disappear I feel very tired, even to the point of falling asleep. Three months ago I began to have palpitations with even light exercise, although, the chest pains have not changed in their timing or intensity.   I've always heard if you have chest pains to check it out. But all of my tests have been normal except the cholesterol. I take 40 mg of Crestor for that and 25 mg of Toprol XL for the palpitations.

    "content": "Hi there --  While the palpitations actually are of little diagnostic value or prognostic significance, the fact that they helped bring your attention to your heart (because of personal and family history) they have served a useful purpose. The pain you describe certainly could be due to an occult blockage (you haven't as yet had an angiogram, correct?). A stress test plain (with no nuclear study) won't always uncover early or even advanced CAD. At the very least, given your history and rather severe hyperlipidemia, I would think a nuc scan/stress test would be appropriate, with possible followup angiogram if anything looks \"interesting.\" The fact that you're having not only substernal pain with exertion but also fatigue after, is suggestive in your particular setting. The fact that you're relatively young for CAD doesn't mean much with your history and lipid profile. Further, the cholesterol-lowering medication could certainly be pushed further (increased), probably to good effect.   While worry isn't a very productive emotion, concern can be, and can often be channeled into constructive action. I think that given your labs and family history you might want to think about pushing for a more accurate profile/baseline picture of your cardiac health. You may actually be perfectly fine now, but all that colesterol isn't just being peed away. It's about twice what one would expect at your age, so a lot of it is getting deposited as plaque on artery walls somewhere in your body -- probaly in a number of places -- and could not only be reduced in the blood but also, studies suggest, diet, exercise and sufficient dosing of cholesterol lowering drugs may just reverse some of the plaque buildup.   Your biggest challenge may be to work toward future good health rather than meet an immediate challenge, but that, in itself, becomes an immediate challenge, especially since you do describe some potentially telling symptoms. The palpitations may or may not be related to developing CAD -- it doesn't really matter, because we all get those from time to time anyway. Still, I would push for the most accurate baseline \"snapshot\" of where your coronary arteries are right now, for the purpose of future reference, at least. I hope this is helpful, and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Somehow your PS post posted after my initial response. Anyway, this does throw a little extra light on things, as the extra weight, especially with hiatal hernia and GERD could certainly provoke chest pains that might well mimic cardiac pain, since it's all in the same neighborhood and shares much of the same nerve supply.   Metabolic syndrome is worth looking into simply as a motivator to lose the excess weight, since this seems to be one of the single biggest contributors to insuling resistance, type II diabetes, metabolic syndrome, etc.   I think you may have uncovered a very likely cause of your symptoms. Treatment for the hiatal hernia/GERD would be very informative if it produced good results. Loss of the extra weight would also affect this as well as any possible pre-diabetic problems.  Good luck!

I've been taking 20mg of Prilosec OTC daily for a few years now, however, it doesn't always control the reflux and \"knawing\" stomach. Judging by my symptoms which include moderate to severe upper abdominal pain, I think I may also have an ulcer, although I've never sought treatment for it - keeping it full helps. The reason I became so concerned with my chest pain is it's timing - during heavy exercise. Can gastric disorders also be aggravated by exertion and cause this type of pain?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While women do tend to present most often with atypical symptoms when they have heart disease, what you describe, because of its \"wandering\" nature, its general location, and the fact that it seems to have remained stable (except for its focus) is probably not cardiac in origin. However...  You did have a false positive nuc scan back around the time of the start of this pain. I'm curious as to how your doctor determined the test to be false positive. This has to have been determined by some further testing. Did you subsequently have a followup nuc scan/stress test or perhaps an angiogram? False positives are more common in women than men, usually due to breast tissue (when there is a good deal of it present). However, a positive test with no symptoms doesn't automatically rule out heart disease. I don't think your current symptoms are cardiac related, but I'd be remiss if I didn't suggest that this be ruled out with some degree of certainty, along with trying to determine the cause of your discomfort.  Possible causes of your wandering pain: postural problems of which you would likely be unaware (and can be fairly subtle), cervical or thoracic spine problems, lower GI irritation (often just gas collected in the splenic flexure of the colon on the left side can cause pain that's referred up against the diaphragm, which then distributes it randomly in the general area you describe), Tietz' syndrome (costochondritis), an inflammation of the cartilage between the ribs, and even thoracic outlet syndrome, an abnormality of the brachial plexus which can cause wandering pain in the back, neck, chest, arm and hand and even numbness and tingling in the pinkie finger and side of the hand on the affected side). All these things could be explored and ruled in or out.   I'd be very interested to learn how your doctor determined your stress test to be false positive. Other than that, I think you might look at the rather long list of potential non-cardiac causes of your pain and perhaps start ruling these out, one or more at a time, via an orthopedist or neurologist.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 35 year old tall slim female with many of the typical MVP symptoms. I suffered stress depression and anxiety from childhood, and took antidepressants for many years (dosulepin). I had Cognitive Behavioural Therapy which has virtually cured me, and after reducing them gradually, stopped them totally in April this year. Two months after this I started getting heart symptoms including: chest pain, severe palpitations, a choking sensation, dizziness, and near faints. I had a 4 day heart monitor which showed extra beats, and these are my echo results: LV appears undilated with normal wall thickness. Overall/reasonable/good systolic LV function with an estimated EF55%. In the apical views the IVS appears mildy dyskinetic. RV appears undilated with good contractility. RA/LA of normal size. All valves appear structurally normal for age. Unable to determine number of cusps for AV. Trivial mitral regurgitation detected using doppler. MMode/2d measurements & calculations IVSd: 0.80 cm LVIDd: 4.1 cm LVIDs: 2.7 cm LVPWd: 0.70 cm FS: 34% ESV(Teich): 27 ml EF(Teich) 64% LA dimension: 2.6 cm When I had a guided tour of my heart, I saw the 2 chamber apical view, and was shown my left venticle, atrium & mitral valve. The leaflet that I could see was an arced horseshoe shape, and as it was beating it seemed to be wavering.  Does this all sound normal, as I've been told I definitely haven't got MVP?

    "title": "Re: Has MVP been missed on echocardiogram???",
    "content": "Hi there -  Your perplexity is understandable, and yes, one might say MVP could be \"missed\" on echo. Actually what sometimes happens is that it disappears. It's difficult to find two doctors who will agree on the diagnostic criteria for MVP anyway, as many prefer to regard it as a \"variant of normal.\" What you describe re: the visible mitral leaflet is that it may possess \"redundant\" tissue, which is a roundabout way of saying it's not perfectly normal, but doesn't meet a given doctor's \"gold standard\" for prolapse. (The actual gold standard is a triad which is rarely seen: floppy leaflet, click murmur and flattening of T-waves in some leads).   In short, one may have MVP and/or MVP syndrome without prolapse being revealved upon echocardiogram. Then  the patient must either accept the (questionable) diagnosis of no MVP, or seek a second opinion.   MVP, when it is treated, is almost always treated symptomatically, and some centers regard the syndrome as the condition,  not the other way around. Therefore, some people,  those with significant and disruptive or disturbing (to the patient) symptoms are treated for the symptoms, usually with  a beta blocker, which reduces both the frequency and force of premature beats, discourages paroxysmal tachycardia from occurring, and helps with chest pain and other symptoms. Some  patients are also given an anti-anxiety medication as well, if that seems appropriate, since anxiety and panic attacks, as you already know, are frequently associated with MVP or at least the syndrome.   Since the  mitral leaflets are composed of vascular tissue, they can shrink and enlarge just enough to appear \"redundant\", prolapsed or normal on any given day of any give echocardiogram. Because of this it can be \"missed\" or, more properly, be missing, at any given time and yet appear some other time. The syndrome is what is important, as the valvular derangement is almost never significant and doesn't even account for the symptoms anyway.   You certainly describe the symptoms which comprise MVP syndrome, even though you may not have a concrete diagnosis of MVP and, in fact, have been told the opposite. Well, you didn't have it that day. But the syndrome, because it doesn't necessarily correlate with the prolapse anyway, is what is treated, and what you probably have. It's not life threatening, not dangerous, but can be very frustrating, alarming, and lifestyle-threatening (causing one to limit one's activity needlessly).   You might consider a second opinion for this, since while your heart is structurally normal, with or without MVP, you may well benefit from medical treatment of MVP syndrome.   I hope this is helpful. You're healthy, but if you don't feel as though you are, it's understandable. Best of luck to you, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome!  I think the second opinion is a pretty good idea, even if it doesn't yield any new information.   About that \"mildly dyskenetic IVS\": the IVS is your intraventricular septum, the wall which separates the two lower chambers of the heart so the fresh and \"used\" blood doesn't mix. \"Mildly dyskenetic\" means it moves a tiny bit sluggishly relative to the free walls of the ventricles. This  is usually a pretty meaningless finding,  but we are obligated to note all things normal and,  consequently, anything that isn't exactly as described in the textbook. It's more a description than a diagnosis of anything, and this particular finding borders on being completely meaningless.   Again, you're very welcome. Every patient deserves to be taken seriously, but you fall into a subset of patients who often are not, which is something of a sore spot with me. It's my pleasure to take the time to explain these things. I hope you'll follow up with us after your second opinion, and follow up with us if you have any further questions as well.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, At last I've managed to get a second opinion, but it's not been an easy task though! I started off by talking about it with my Doctor, and was told that I was ok. I then ended up being taken to Accident & Emergency, they gave me an ECG which lasted about 30 seconds, and they sent me home after telling me it was normal. I then decided that I'd had enough of the NHS, and decided to ask my Doctor for a private referral to see a Cardiologist, which she was happy to do. I was lucky as the half an hour appointment that I had, was with the lead consultant in the area, and he took the time to listen, and explain things to me. He looked at my reports and said that there is a possibilty that I have got MVP, but as the regurgitation is only slight at present, it is of no significance. He asked if I had a history of Marfans  in the family (which I haven't) as apparently I have the typical build of people affected by this syndrome. He also said that females; particularly ones with my build, are more likely to get mitral regurgitation, and has suggested that I contact him on a yearly basis to have an Echocardiogram, to check whether or not it has worsened. When I asked about medication for my symptoms, he said that they would normally prescribe a betablocker, but in my case he did not think it would be a good idea, as my blood pressure is quite low, and it may make me feel worse. Even though I still frequently suffer the symptoms, I do feel reassured that I'm not about to drop dead. Although, I do feel a bit disappointed that I didn't have a second Echocardiogram, and the chance of possibly having MVP diagnosed, so I still don't really have a definite answer to what causes my symptoms. What do you think, should I just accept this, and hope it shows up in my echocardiogram next year? Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Good deal about the private referral! That worked out extremely well, it seems.   I think you got a comprehensive and useful answer, and the sort that you may want to get used to, since marginal MVP is often not visible and is clincally inconsequential. What's important is the set of symptoms that is associated with it, even when it's not actually possible to visualize the MVP. The only real use of an MVP diagnosis is that more doctors are more likely then to treat the symptoms, even though they have no clear conncection to the prolapse anyway. This is an enduring mystery, why people with even borderline or intermittent finding of MVP (or none at all) can have significant, annoying (though not dangerous) symptoms. It's worth going back to check on a yearly basis, and perhaps one of those times it will be evident. The important thing, though, is that the symptoms be treated, since the actual prolapse, if there is any, is almost always irrelevant to anything else.   It's true, or at least seems to be the case (I'm not sure anyone has actually compiled statistics) that tall, willowy people with longer than average long bones (arms, legs) and who tend to look similar to  possible Marfan's patients, do tend to have MVP more often, as well as loose joints, and other Marfan's-like issues, without actually having the genetic defect and actual Marfan's syndrome. Also, women seem more likely than men, in general, and women of your build in particular, to have either MVP or at least MVP sydrome. Again, what's important is to relieve the symptoms or at least help the patient adapt to them. In some clinics, at least here in the US, MVP syndrome without a finding of MVP is called dysautonomia, meaning a malfunction or inappropriate responses by the autonomic nervous system, which is what MVP syndrome is anyway. The symptoms are classic, and are often treatable with beta blocking drugs, anti-anxiety medication, and sometimes even cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). All these are worth a look-see.  Good luck to you, and I'm happy to learn everything seems to be in order. If one has to have attention drawn to the heart, it's good to know at least the heart is heatlthy, even if symptoms are unnerving. As you say, you can know you're not going to drop over, and that's worth a lot!\n\n",

She had a cardiac catherization in December and was told that, although she had some 50-60% blockage, it was nothing that needed to be removed.  She was given nitroglycerin and isosorbide at that time to deal with the pains.  She later saw her primary care physician, who thought the pain in her arms (she had developed similar pain also in the right arm) was bursitis.  He gave her injections (a steroid?) in each arm, and the pain in the arms did improve after that.  She decided that she did not want to continue taking the isosorbide, when the arm pains went away.  However, she started having a strange pain, mostly when she is sitting or lying down, in her chest (maybe 3 or 4 inches higher than the base of the sternum) when her heart beats.  She says that it happens most of the time now when she is sitting or lying down.   Do you have any idea what could be causing these pains?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pain when heart beats",
    "content": "Hello --  It's an odd symptom, but sometimes happens when one's heart starts beating in a regularly irregular fashion called ventricular bigemeny. It's not really serious, just a regular occurence of a premature heartbeat followed by a normal one. This can, if timed a certain way, cause pain or pressure. This sort of arrhythmia is often seen in association with short-term steroid use, too. Heart pain also often occurs when lying down if the patient has pericarditis, an inflammation of the sac around the heart, which also may have some fluid buildup inside it. This is possible since your mother recently an angiogram, which can sometimes cause this sort of inflammation. Other than these two things it's hard to imagine what could be causing pain in time with the  heart beat, that is, if I am understanding the description right. If she simply has pain when she's sitting or lying down then pericarditis is more likely. Of course there are other, more obscure possible causes, such as sliding hiatal hernia, but this probably would have been present for a long time before now.   All the above mentioned things are pretty benign. If the problem persists or becomes more pronounced then it most certainly should be checked, but if  it remains stable and only happens in relation to posture, it's probably nothing very serious.  I hope this is helpful. If you have any further information, by all means share it or just follow up with us as needed. Good luck to you and your mother.\n\n",

This is called costochondritis, and usually is highly localized (unlike heart pain, which almost always radiates to one or more distant areas),  is aggravated by upper body movement,  and responds well to anti-inflammatory pain medications such as ibuprofin or naproxyn.   Heart pain also is rarely stable,  but tends to progress,  and is usually accompanied by other  symptoms (such as weakness, faintness, nausea, shortness of breath, etc.).   Your blood lipids are  very good overall, and this somewhat makes up for the low HDL, which is preferred to be closer to 40, but that in itself isn't a major risk for you at this point,  although it's something you could work on.  In  short,  your pain sounds  unlike anything serious. I'd suggest a trial of one of the anti-inflammatory drugs as mentioned above. Otherwise, by all means go forward with your plan to stop smoking, which will eliminate a major risk for a great many things you realy don't want to develop later on. Good luck to you, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your quick reply. I'm really feeling much better than before.   Now I restrict my cigarette smoking to 1-2 per day ( previously 10-15). Within a few days i will be able to quit this completely. But after restriction over the cigarettes, i faced a few problem. i found some mild chest pains in the center of my chest & mostly on left chest.. sometimes right also, but not in rib joint. I feel a bit chest tightness also.   One more thing, i've a problem with cough.. it's increases after my morning meal & sometime i feel like something is want to exit from my lungs. But no vomiting. Now, the color of the cough is white, a few days earlier it's yellowish & after restrict upon cigarette it was yellowish with very little black contents. Now, there is no black contents, it's white now. i don't know, it's normal cough or something serious. I don't have cough problem before.. but from last 1 year it's pain me.  Want your suggestions for that.\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome and I'm glad you're feeling better.  The cough you're experiencing, since it happens in the morning after eating, may be related to acid reflux from the stomach, or could also be due to loosening of secretions due to much-reduced smoking. If it's gone from yellow to white, then it's probably improving, or else that change could be due to less tar and other combustion by-products entering the lungs. Hopefully this resolves completely as you finish your smoking cessation program.  The pain is likely related to the coughing. If the cough and pain don't resolve or at least start to get better over the course of a week or so, you should have this checked by a doctor. Otherwise it sounds as though you are doing really well. Keep up the good work.\n\n",

Yesterday I see some blood coming from my mouth (not with cough.. with spit - don't know it's from respiratory organs or from gum or teeth.. may be teeth, coz my teeth is very poor). There is no pain. I tried to cough more, but no blood coming. But in the afternoon.. when i spit.. i see some blood.. I don't know what is the reason behind it. From tomorrow i wake up at 6:00AM (but i always wake up at 9:30) & feel i've some problem with my breathings. I've another problem form last 1-2 months in breathings. Sometimes I breath suddenly & inhale a lot of air.. ( daily 1-2 times).. I don't know why it's occours.

    "content": "The chest discomfort (\"strain\") is almost certainly orthopedic and/or muscular, as it is provoked by certain bodily movements. No problem there.  The blood from your mouth, since it was not produced by coughing nor vomited up, and since you acknowlege dental problems, is probably due to inflammation of your gums, which often happens with poor dental hygeine and can produce spontaneous gum bleeding at random times. If at all possible, even if you do nothing else, it would be important to have your teeth checked and have a deep cleaning done to reduce inflammation of the gums, as this is often a source of later trouble in various organ systems, something that can be avoided with proper maintainane.  Other than that it sounds as though you are doing well.\n\n",

    "content": "34 year old male, no family history of heart disease save one grandfather who was undoubtedly exacerbated by smoking. Don't drink, don't smoke, no recreational drug use, high moderate level of activity (fencing 2x per week for 2+ hours)  About a month ago, I started having episodes where my heart rate elevated from a completely resting position (120-130bpm, sometimes higher). Went to the ER, had EKG/blood work (I don't know the full details but I know it screened for heart damage and thyroid issues) as well as a chest X-ray and CAT scan with and without dye.  There has also been a second ER visit, about a month later with similar symptoms, EKG and bloodwork were done again with no abnormalities.  Was disagnosed with panic disorder (which I do have a history of, but had fully resolved itself a few years back. Started Lorazepam as needed, switched to Clonazepam for a longer duration of help, and have just started on sertraline this past week.  My daily life now consists of a dizzying variety of symptoms, including:  1) Burning sensation in my chest, across both sides of the pectorals; pressing on my chest will make the burning worse when that happens. (This happened to me last night, and I was able to walk down a slope for 2+ miles with no shortness of breath or other symptoms)  2) Pain in my left arm/wrist/fingers sometimes going up to the shoulder (this has been diagnosed by my PCP as the beginnings of carpal tunnel, but it doesn't seem to be dependent on the activity level of that arm, and it doesn't exist on the right side)  3) Feeling of extremely hot skin along my face/neck/shoulders  4) Pain up the left side of my neck sometimes accompanied by a throbbing pulse.  5) Occasional \"shooting\" pains in my chest, usually at the right side of my sternum.  These all occur when I am completely at rest and have no anxiety triggers to speak of. I don't get anxious UNTIL I feel one or more of these happening for a while.  Shortness of breath is notably absent as a symptom, except when I get super anxious and start breathing faster due to that.  With the anxiety, of course, every one of these when they happen makes me want to run to the ER, but as I am still waiting for new insurance to kick in, that's a spendy proposition. At the same time,   Every single day, I am hitting one or more of these symptoms, and it's having a drastic effect on my daily life. I've spoken to my PCP about all of these symptoms and have been told \"your heart is fine, you don't need to be worrying this much\".  Should I be trying to push harder for more testing to be done? In particular, I didn't have an electrocardiogram; is there a possibility that something might show on that that hasn't shown on the testing done previously?  It is just difficult to chalk up all of these various symptoms to being \"just symptoms of a panic attack\", especially when I don't feel panicked until well after they start.\n\n",

EKG looked fine at the ER, and they tested all the usual things for a possible cardiac event as well as doing a CT scan for a possible pulmonary embolism; all came back negative.  Even now, though, I feel nauseous and am having a little trouble breathing, along with feeling flushed. Yet every time I go to the ER, they can't find anything.  I did wear a 48 hour Holter monitor last week as well as a 24 hour urine test to check for a possible tumor overstimulating the adrenal gland. No results back from those tests yet.  Am I going insane? I have a past history of panic attacks but these just feel different and my body just doesn't feel right.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While you describe a galaxy of symptoms that most likely are attributable to panic disorder and/or mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVPS) or both, it is unreasonable for a doctor to \"diagnose\" you as simply an anxious patient (which you undoubtedly are or have been) when you present with potential cardiac symptoms (even if they are \"only\" anxiety-related) without having performed an EKG.   While I truly believe, based on your description of your symptoms, that they are likely as above (either anxiety or MVPS or both), if MVP is at the bottom of this it would certainly be helpful to know, as addition of a beta blocker (low dose) might well help and work well with either clonazepam or sertraline to manage the symptoms and help you feel more safe and secure. And of course, if the EKG did show up  some other extraneous and unlikely factor, well, we always need to remember that even anxious patients can also get sick. This tends to slip the minds of many healthcare providers. At any rate, taking the little extra time and care just once, to set your mind at ease, could save everyone a lot of worry and time and exense in the long run.   Hopefully this helps put things into perspective for you. Please feel free to follow up with any other questions or to update us. Thanks for using this site to find your answers. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

The Holter results should be surfacing soon, and they should be interesting even if they show nothing (which would help build a case for anxiety disorder as the underlying cause). So what you haven't had done, then, is an echocardiogram. Well, that certainly wouldn't hurt, again if only to rule out any structural heart problems. Anything that either points to a problem (which then can be addressed) or rules one out (thus setting your mind more at ease) is going to be helpful and this wouldn't be an unreasonable thing to expect.   By all means let us know when you have the Holter monitor results so we can discuss them. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Mr. Kenyon:  Just to follow up, I got a call from my PCP about my Holter monitor results, and he said that aside from a few rare premature beats that everyone gets from time to time, everything looked normal.  In addition, the urine testing for pheochromocytoma came back negative as well.  However, I am still getting these \"episodes\" from time to time (once a week or less) that I can't explain, that the Holter didn't capture.  The symptoms, as best I can describe them: 1) Flushed feeling, especially across my shoulders and neck 2) Sudden extreme anxiety/inability to sit still 3) Feeling like I need to sit forward/fidget.  There's no pain or chest tightness associated with them, and I usually feel fine within five minutes after or so (although there's sometimes some residual \"what the heck was that\" anxiety).  What could be causing something like this to happen? I do know that I was at the ER once and had the feeling I am describing, and the yellow alert light on the bedside heart monitor went off; but no one came rushing in to check on me or anything along those lines.  My PCP is awesome, but his response to my description of these symptoms was \"I have no real idea what that might be\".  They definitely don't feel like the panic attacks I am used to, but it's not impossible it's just a different \"flavor\" of them than normal.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  This is actually quite helpful, as the triad of \"new\" symptoms you describe here is another set of things that are classic, at some point or another, for PD, GAD and MVPS. With the latter (and sometimes actually a cause of the former), we sometimes see what's known as dysautonomia, which can either be a result of MVPS/anxiety/PD or, perhaps, causes or triggers it. What dysautonomia means, literally, is \"dysfunction of the  autonomic nervous system.\" The autonomic nervous system is that part which controls a lot of normally unnoticed functions, such as heart rate and output regulation, moment-to-moment blood pressure regulation, and even dilation of blood vessels, especially capillaries in the skin. While this can be an essential and physical (though poorly understood) syndrome, it is also definitely a part of various anxiety syndromes. These are all inter-related, including MVPS. In some clinics MVPS is simply called dysautonomia, as there is often no evidence of MVP, yet the same symptoms are present. The symptoms change often, also, which is frustrating as can be, and are either the product of, or the cause of, much anxiety.   The flushed feeling across your neck and shoulders is extremely common in people with any combination of these problems, as is the sudden, spiked level of anxiety; needless to say, the feeling the need to lean forward at these times goes with the triad, and is less well understood, but probably has something to do with a sense of being able to breathe more easily or perhaps is an anticipatory posture poised for \"fight or flight\", which is where all these feelings become confused in the temporal lobe of the brain. One senses a threat and is prepared to run, although to where and from what is not exactly clear.   Again, this is all classic, it is benign, but since it's new it will command your attention for a while. Once you've become more accustomed to it and perhaps even begin to ignore it, often the process will shift to some other set of equally odd and functionally pointless sensations. It's very difficult to subjectively recognize these things as a rule, because they keep changing their \"colors\" periodically, or, worse, adding to their \"repertoir.\" Ideally what is most helpful is for the affected individual to learn to maintain the presence of mind to evaluate and dismiss these things as meaningless. unfortunately, the snap responses often elicited by chronic anxiety (and always in the panicky patient) make this nearly impossible, at least in the short run. This is why I so often recommend a referral to a psychotherapist who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), since it is an education and re-training process rather than endless \"talk\" therapy, and the patient actually has \"homework\" which helps, along with the sessions, in learning how to recognize and manage the symptoms. Often it results in a dramatic improvement and even if the symptoms persist, the patient no longer reacts to them the same way, but learns to evaluate what is going on calmly and once this is accomplished, the symptoms no longer have the power to control the patient. Anti-anxiety medication sometimes works well in combination with CBT.  Your PCP is technically correct to say he has \"no idea\" what might be causing these symptoms, since they fit no ordinary medical paradigm for illness. However, many seasoned MDs will recognize these as part of the classic anxiety/dysautonomia picture and refer accordingly. If your doctor doesn't do this you may ask for an appropriate referral or seek effective help independently.   This can be a long, annoying process, but in the end you'll wind up with a lot of valuable self-insights that are gratifying, not to mention the fact that you'll feel in control of your life once again.   Best of luck to you. Please stay in touch.\n\n",

The sertraline is definitely starting to have a noticeable effect as well, and I'm already tapering down the benzodiapines and hope to not have to use them at all going forward.

I wake up fine in the morning; in the late morning/early afternoon I start to get a heavy feeling in my chest, with occasional pain near the side of my sternum (usually on the right side though, not the left).  Then in the evenings, I start getting very noticeable palpitations. I can actually, when at rest, see my stomach vibrating in time with my heartbeat.  No shortness of breath still, or anything like that. However, my benzodiapines don't really help much either, so I have to just wait it out.

    "content": "Hello again-  I think this is probably the anxiety \"talking\" in a new symptomatic dialect, and certain of the symptoms can be explained as (relatively) normal. Still, given the fact that even an anxious person can have physical problems, and because reassurance of the concrete kind is so helpful in the setting of anxiety, that I think it might be worth a trip to the doctor anyway.  Those symptoms are, to a great extent explainable. For instance, the ability to see your heartbeat by looking at your stomach while lying on your back is actually so normal as to be almost universal. While a very pronounced pulsing may be cause for concern, the problem is interpreting the word \"pronounced\" against a background of anxiousness. Again, almost anyone can see this pulsing when lying supine, with or without palpitations. Palpitations, by the way, occur most commonly (in otherwise healthy people) in the evening, after the evening meal and close to bedtime, two times when the vagus nerve is active, stimulated, and trying to slow the heartbeat, which always predisposes to premature heartbeats. This phenomenon is normal.   Some palpitations happen to be felt by some people during periods of utterly normal sinus rhythm (NSR), so the word loses a little of its meaning. If they are only felt as distinctly \"missed\" or \"skipped\" beats (both are misnomers, but make good descriptors of the sensation) it is more meaningful, but no more serious. These are still normal. And again, they happen most often in healthy people later in the day or evening, especially after dinner and before bedtime.   The heavy feeling in your chest deserves the appropriate attention, in your case perhaps an echocardiogram, as pretty much everything else has already been done. If you were to learn via echo that you have mitral valve prolapse (MVP) it might actually ease your mind, since it is a benign condition that is often accompanied by chronic anxiety and panic disorder, so that could explain a lot. If it doesn't show up, however, then that's one less thing that's not exactly normal, so it would be a win-win. The right-sided sternal-edge pain sounds like it is probably costochondritis, something that responds to simple over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofin (Advil), and if it can be reproduced by manual pressure on the spot, and if it does not radiate to the shoulder, arm, neck or back, then it is probably nothing of concern.   So given this information, I'd still make a doctor appointment and while there explain what's been going on, if only so you can be told you're fine. There's nothing wrong with that kind of news. You might also mention that the benzodiazepines don't seem to be working well and ask if there is something else that might warrant a trial.   That's about it. Hang in there. You'll have better days and worse ones with anxiety as an underlying problem, but on the whole it seems you're doing quite well and just require some occasional reassurance. There's nothing wrong with that.\n\n",

    "content": "Doing better these days as far as the anxiety goes, but I do have one new symptom that is puzzling me.  I get tightness (no pain, just tightness/pressure) across my chest, concentrated above the level of my sternum, a couple of times a week. My doctor thinks it's connected with the anxiety issues, even though I don't have any feelings of anxiety that go along with it.  I tried a muscle relaxant (Flexeril) to try to help with it, but didn't get much relief; if anything, my Clonazepam helps more, as does regular aspirin, but neither of them gets me enough relief to be comfortable when it happens.  My doctor prescribed Prednisone to see if it's an inflammatory issue that might be helped by that medication, but I'm leery of Prednisone after reading about some of the potential side effects.  At the same time, it's pretty uncomfortable (I'd describe it as someone tightening a metal band around the upper part of my chest), so I'm willing to try just about anything at this point.  I'm past the point where I think it's anything cardiac-related with all the testing that has been done, but maybe it's worth revisiting? Should I maybe seek a second opinion, or try to self-refer to a cardiologist just incase something got missed?\n\n",

    "content": "The sensation is an interesting variation on an anxiety theme, and one thing I do like to stress is that even anxious people can get sick or have physical problems. Sometimes  doctors do tend to begin to attribute frequently changing complaints to anxiety (and usually they are right), but there is a certain value in exhausting some of the aresenal of tests to ease the mind of the patient and confirm beyond any reasonable doubt that there's nothing else going on. For that reason I think it would be not unreasonable for you to have both an echocardiogram and stress test, if these haven't already been done by now. I think the current chest symptom does sound like a variation on an established  theme (anxiety), and it is telling that Flexeril doesn't help as much as clonazepam. If it is actually inflamatory musculoskeletal in nature, the steroids will probably make it go away; the most likely side-effects would be increased heart rate, increased tension, possible flushing (or sunburned appearance on the face and chest) and slightly increased blood pressure. These effects could last up to a week, but if they relieved the primary complaint that would prove several things: first, that the problem is superficial and physical,  and second that you can know what to expect from steroid therapy,  and this might actually help you to recognize anxiety symptoms via cause and effect, since if your chest symptom is anxiety-based, again, the anxious person is usually the last to realize this fact. It's a very frustrating feature of anxiety that we tend to deny its presence or totally fail to recognize it. This actually makes sense, since it's a status we live with for such a long time it becomes like \"background noise\" and we tune it out unless it's punctuated by panic attacks.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please continue to keep us updated. I think the steroid \"experiment\" might well be worthwhile, at least so long as you're aware of the possible side effects of short-term steroid therapy as outlined above.\n\n",

    "content": "Well, the weird (or not so weird depending on your point of view) thing is that I tolerate exercise just fine. I fence recreationally, which is pretty demanding of the cardiovascular system, and I don't have any problems at all.  And my perceived level of anxiety has improved markedly since starting the sertraline; if there's \"background noise\" anxiety that's causing these symptoms, I just need to figure out how to better manage the symptoms, because they aren't making me feel anxious enough that I'm doing silly things like rushing to the emergency room, anymore.  Still, discomfort is discomfort and I want to get to where I can feel \"normal\" as much of the time as I can. Hopefully the steroid experiment will get me there, and help me and my doctor figure out how to manage these symptoms long-term.  Thanks again for all of the follow-up!\n\n",

    "content": "Mr. Kenyon:  Not sure if you're still watching this thread for comments or not, but I got a copy of my medical records today and there were a few things in there that I want to ask some questions about, and see if you think I should get evaluated additionally.  I'll preface it by saying that we've moved up to 50mg on my sertraline as of the last few days, but I'm still having lots of chest tightness, in addition to severe left arm pain/ache and the occasional palpitation (still no real pain in the chest itself though).  Here's the things I'm curious about:  1) On two of my four ER visits, they did a D-Dimer test on me, and it was \"elevated\". They did CT scans both times and found nohing there to worry about. There is a part about \"tiny exophytic probable small cyst in the left upper pole kidney\" noted, but I gather that's a minor thing.  The D-dimer level on the one test was H 0.87 mcg/mL with a \"ref range\" of 0.22-0.50, so about .30 higher than the top of the ref range.  On the other, it was 0.74, again slightly higher than the norm.  The other two times, it was normal.  2) The EKGs they did on me Show some concerning things:  All of them show sinus tachycardia, but that is to be expected since that was my initial comlaint with all of these visits.  However, they also show things like (on various of the EKGs, these are all the things I see that I don't know what they mean):  [SR] - [Now Absent] Sinus Rhythm [QT] 328 - [SIGR] Significant Rhythm Changes [QRSD] 96 - [REPDI] - Nonspecific Repol Abnormality, Diffuse Leads [Remains] PR 160 - [ETRSR1} - RSR' in V1 or V2, Right VCD or RVH T -5, T -15 = Abnormal Confirmed under Axis (on two different ones) T -46 - Abnormal ECG (this was from the time that was probably the worst)  The 48-hour Holter monitor seemed to be pretty normal, with one thing I am wondering about:  There were 55 \"brady runs\" (I am assuming this is bradycardia), with the longest being 23 beats, and the maximum brady rate being 42.  This is a lot of word salad to me, but the consistent message from my primary doctor and all of the ER personnel has been that \"everything is normal, you're fine\", and yet I'm seeing a lot of \"elevated\" and \"abnormal\" and other disturbing words.  If you're able to take a look through this, it'd be greatly appreciated; I'm contemplating getting a second opinion but at the same time, I have a lot of faith in my doctor and trust that he is looking out for my best interests. At the same time, there's a lot in here that LOOKS out of the scope of normal to a layman's eye.  Appreciate any help you can give!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While your resting heart rate is higher than average, it does fall within the broad, statistical range of \"normal.\" Anything between 60 and 100 is generally considered to be \"normal.\" So far, so good, unless you previously averaged a significantly slower rate.   The fact that your rate reaches 180 - 200 during presumably vigorous exercise puts you at a slightly higher rate than expected  (a working range of 75 - 90 per cent of your maximum heart rate is considered the aerobic range for working out, and using the standard aerobic formula of 220 minus your age equals a maximum rate of 201; 90 per cent of this would be 180). Based on the calculated rates just stated, you're really working at or just above the high end of your projected effective aerobic range, which isn't unusual at all. Again, so far, so good.  The only concern I draw from what you've reported here is the actual chest pain during peak exercise (shortness of breath at peak exercise is not uncommon if not extreme), and this could be caused by many things, some unrelated to heart. If you could describe the character of the pain you experience and the location, this might help determine if you may be having some heart related problem or if this is something else. The rate numbers themselves are really not bad. Please let me know if the shortness of breath is significant and how quickly you recover from it, as well as a description of the nature and location of the pain you have. I'll be standing by to hear more. Good luck to you in the meanwhile.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While there's no chance you damaged your lungs, depending upon the type of paint it could have some effect on different organ systems, but only if it's highly volatile and is inhaled in a poorly ventilated atmosphere. I'm not familar with fabric paint specifically, but you might look on the label for warnings about inhaling and what the contents are. Most paints are fairly innocent now, although some paint thinners (usually used in house painting) can be fairly noxious. They won't hurt your lungs as a rule, but prolonged, repeated exposure in unventilated areas can be damaging to the liver, kidneys or brain over long periods of time, and even this is rare. You weren't using house paint products or thinners. I think this is all fine.  Hope this is helpful. It's better to check and be safe rather than sorry. No need to worry though.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: chest pain, SOB on exertion",
    "content": "Hi there -  I'd say that based on your family history and the too-short-to-be-conclusive stress test you probably have reason to be concerned, although I wouldn't go beyond \"concerned\" at this point. I do feel you should be worked up more thoroughly, however, preferably including a stress test with nuclear scan, and an echocardiogram.   The long Q-T on EKG could be a separate concern, but was probably transient (and should be rechecked to be certain); T-wave abnormalities are frequently seen in healthy people for various reasons, but when  coupled with symptoms such as you describe they shouldn't be brushed off. However, you're a young, otherwise healthy woman, so it's difficult for a lot of doctors to accept that there could be a cardiac cause for the symptoms. This is an ongoing problem, because odds are the symptoms aren't cardiac-related,  but they are caused by something, and heart disease is too often overlooked in younger women.   Since pulmonary hypertension seems to be ruled out I'm thinking possibly a structural abnormality of the heart's workings. It could be a thickened chamber wall, a malfunctioning valve, something like that. An echocardiogram would  very likely rule this sort of thing out -- or in.   For the time being,  I'd recommend not over-exerting, and to be very aggressive in seeing that you're followed up for this. Something is causing the symptoms and they are somewhat troubling. They could be due to something fairly minor, but until it's clarified it's not safe to assume there's nothing to this. The symptoms speak for themselves.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.    Having seen a pulmonologist was a very good idea and happily things appear to be fine there. I was thinking possible pulmonary hypertension, but apparently not. Good.  The left atrial enlargement finding is also common and usually meaningless, but also can occur in conjunction with systemic hypertension. Since your blood pressure did get rather high very quickly during your stress test (and I'm assuming this is why it was terminated after less than two minutes, since you were nowhere near your maximum heart rate), your symptoms may be due to some sort of blood pressure abnormality. Do you know what your normal resting BP is?\n\n",

First priority is to protect yourself. If this is due to heart disease (and the symptoms and your age point argue in favor of the possibility) then you'll need to do some things to correct the problem. Since you haven't been felled by a coronary event as yet, you may well be able to dodge the bullet altogether and return to your active lifestyle. However, if you continue to push without checking this out, you may not afford yourself the opportunity to live a long, competitive life on the courts.

The cough has gotten worse and worse, the phlegm I cough up when I manage to is pale yellow with the occasional streaks of blood. I can taste blood when I cough but I haven't actually coughed up just blood (in my spit etc). The problem is that I can barely walk anywhere without getting extremely out of breath, I can barely breathe and it hurts when I breathe in and out now (I assume because of the violent coughing all the time). It started off that I couldnt breathe properly when I exercised (I am on a snowboarding holiday) so I eased off that, I am a smoker but I stopped for the moment as I assume that it can't be doing my poor lungs any good ! But now I can't even walk down the street without having to take deep rapid breaths. I am constantly wheezing and whistling, it is worse when I lie down. The coughing etc hasn't interfered with my sleep, it's only when I'm awake that I'm coughing and unable to breath properly. Should I be worried ? My partner is, he is attempting to make me go to the hospital but it doesn't sound too serious. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While your situation might  not be an emergency back home, you're in Bulgaria, and you either have severe bronchitis or perhaps even pneumonia, and it's compromising your breathing. This can sometimes get out of hand, and since you're in an area where you probably can't just go to a well-equipped walk-in clinic, the hospital probably wouldn't be a bad idea. You likely need to be on an antibiotic, you most certainly require an expectorant (like  guaifenesin) to  loosen secretions, and you probably would beneft from a breathing treatment (nebulizer). All these would be most readily accessable in the emergency department of a hospital.   I'd vote with your partner. Take care of yourself, please, and by the most expedient route. This would probably be a hospital given where you are right now. Sorry about the vacation, but these things happen.   Good luck to you and please follow up with us.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there. Thank you for you're response. Well, I arrived back in the UK and was almost immediately carted off to the hospital. They administered the usual tests etc and then concluded the same as I did after an X-ray showed an infected lung - severe bronchitis. They helped me with my breathing by using a nebulizer and then gave me a blue inhalor alongside a 7 day course of antibiotics (Amoxycillin/Amoxicillin).  To be honest, although I don't advise it, I didn't finish the full course of antibiotics as they sent me running for the bathroom rather frequently ! I had 2 days left I think.  The inhalor definately helped though (as of course did the antibiotics but I just got rather sick of the sight of my bathroom) and it cleared up within another week.  Overall I would think the bronchitis lasted 2 weeks.  Thank you for your help\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Severe chest pain with exhalation",
    "content": "Hi there -  The likely reason you were prescribed naproxyn for the chest pain is that the ER staff suspected mild  pericarditis (or pleurisy -- the pain and the treatment is the same). Usually with pericarditis the  pain is aggravated by breathing and by lying flat on one's back, and is often relieved by sitting up and/or leaning forward; Also there may even have been some slight suggestion in the  EKG (which I assume they did). Sometimes it doesn't respond to naproxyn, and assuming that's what they were thinking, when it doesn't, then the next step is usually steroids.    It's  very rare for a VSD to cause this sort of symptom unless there's been some  wholesale change, which is also very rare.   Apparently the ER visit didn't do what you needed it to do, which was to find a way to resolve the pain. For this reason, while you would appear to be OK in that there's no emergent problem, you still have this disruptive pain, so you might need to make an appointment  with a doctor who will take the time to sort this out and prescribe something that will   actually manage  the pain til the problem resolves. It really does sound  like  pericarditis, which can be caused by a lot of things, but most often is due to a recent viral infection.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

I did blood work, EKG, ultrasound, stress test and holter for 24 hours. All tests were except he holter were normal. The holter had 4 irregular bits. She suggested I see specialist. The specialist told me that there is nothing to worry, but to be certain he suggested doing nuclear stress test. While waiting for the test I start having numbness\\pain in my left jaw and discomfort/pressure in the left chest, close to the breast towards the shoulder. I also noticed mild ear buzzing. Maybe anxiety was the reason due to a fact that I was waiting for the test/results. The nuclear streets test results were normal. The symptoms went away and come back after 15 days. Thinks to mention is that I have lost some weight (knee injury) for the last 12 months. From 115kg to 102kg. Physical activity 3-4 time a week.  Your help is greatly appreciated.

    "content": "Hi Marko -  The really good news is that you've had a pretty complete cardiological workup and everything came out normal. That's great! The only thing that concerns me is that after having a Holter monitor show only four premature beats in 24 hours, your doctor felt you should see a specialist. This is really odd, because almost young, healthy person might well have at least that many premature beats in 24 hours.   Still,  everything turned out well, and I think you've figured out on your own what was causing the symptoms: the situation was anxiety-producing, and this can often cause us to feel the very symptoms  we're afraid we'll feel. They are real enough,  but the basis for them is  physchogenic. It's a very odd thing but it's true. You at lease have enough insight to realize this is likely what happened. I feel certain you're correct.  Your current occasional chest pain symptoms  may be due to a GI problem that's aggravated by overweight,  and you're well on your way to correcting that  problem. Good job on that!   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "chest pain, tachycardia, leaky valves, hypertension",
    "content": "I'm a 24 year old female with constant chest pain, hypertension, tachycardia, and leaky heart valves.  It all started when I started having chest pain, high blood pressure, and tachycardia out of nowhere, in February.  I tried eating a low salt diet and exercised every day for over a month, with no improvement.  One day in March, I had severe chest pains, so i called an ambulance. I had EKG monitoring, and was tachycardic & hypertensive. At the ER, I was told my EKG was abnormal, and was dx with Pericarditis.   I was given a beta blocker [Lopressor] and antibiotics for a UTI, and released.  I found that I couldn't function on Lopressor, so I stopped. I was given Hydroclorothiazide, and when that didn't work, Lisinopril.   Before starting Lisinopril, I had an Echo done, because at 24, the doctor felt I shouldn't be experiencing these symptoms.  Echo came back with pulmonary regurg, aortic regurg, and mitral valve prolapse.  Before Lisinopril, my bp was 169/119, and my heart rate hovered between 120 and 145 at rest.  After Lisinopril, between 140/90 and 150/90, same pulse as above. Then, my doctor supplemented it with Atenelol, and that has brought my pulse down to between 75 and 89, and my bp is usually around 110/70, or 120/80, and occasionally 141/87 or in the 130's. Pulse has never been higher than 89.  However, my dad spilled my pills and my pulse was hovering around 120 today, and I have SEVERE chest pain. On a scale of one to ten, it was an 8, and it was a squeezing feeling.   I debated going to the hospital, but I decided against it, since I will be able to pick up an emergency supply of Atenelol.  However, I've noticed that I still get chest pain, whether on Atenelol or not. I also get palps, and I get out of breath going up the stairs. I also feel like I am going to pass out, but never do.  Sometimes when I get up, I black out for a couple of seconds, and I am constantly tired.  I am seeing a cardiologist soon, but I was wondering what kind of tests will be done.  The Aortic regurg is trace, the Pulmonary regurg is mild, and the Echo doesn't mention how severe the mitral prolapse is, or whether that also has regurgitation.  Will I be able to find out of the Pulmonary regurg is being caused by Pulmonary hypertension? if not, is there a way to find a cause for all these problems?  Up until last year, I've been pretty heart healthy.   I am a little overweight, but I've lost 20 lbs, seeing as I've apparently developed acid reflux, but wonder if it's related to the heart problems I'm having.  I've went from almost 190 lbs to 170 in 5 weeks. I don't smoke or drink, though I live with my mom, who does smoke.   My grandfather died from COPD (he only had one lung), and my dad has an electrical valve problem with his heart. My grandma also needed a pacemaker, but I wasn't born with any heart problems.  So far, I've been on Norvasc, Lopressor, Hydroclorothiazide, Atenelol and Lisinopril.  The only thing that has seemed to work is the combo of Atenelol + Lisinopril, but I still have symptoms both at rest and with exertion.   I also want to mention that I have different kinds of chest pains, and I have it on both sides, but it mostly comes from the left.  Most of the time, it feels like my heart is being squeezed very hard, but it can sometimes feel like a sharp, stabbing pain, or pinching.  Any insight you could give me would be wonderful.   At first, I wasn't going to go to the cardiologist, but reading about pulmonary regurg, and pulmonary hypertension is what made me go, since PH is a pretty serious problem.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: chest pain, tachycardia, leaky valves, hypertension",
    "content": "Hi there -  You present  a lot of different symptoms and findings, some of which raise some possible concerns, and others that do not, but which probably can be explained.   First, however, I need to know if your diagnosis of pericarditis was upheld and if so, why was it not treated? This can cause significant sharp chest pain, especially when lying down and when taking in breaths. The medications you were given at the time of that diagnosis were aimed at blood pressure management and a bacterial infection, which I find odd. Usually pericarditis is treated at least with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofin or naproxyn. Just wanted to get that out of the way.  As for the echocardiogram findings, \"mild\" pulmonary regurge is fairly common but  probably should be followed up. \"Trace\" aortic regure is extremely common, as is mild-to-moderate mitral regurge, especially when found in comination with MVP, which in itself is so commonplace as to be regarded in some circles as a \"variant of normal.\" It can be associated with other symptoms  such as you describe, however, and in those cases, if there is no other cause, it is called MVP syndrome.   I feel that for your peace of mind and to be prudent and reasonable, PH should be ruled out, even though it is unlikely to show up abruptly as your symptoms have. It's not outside the realm of possibility,  but it is statisically extremely unlikely. Still, it should be ruled out, and yes, this can  be done realtively easily.  Having lost 20 lbs in 5 weeks will cause a lot of people to experience temporary elevation of blood pressure, just FYI.   Sharp,  stabbing  pains are almost never cardiac in  origin. Hopefully that eliminates some of your concerns. Squeezing pain can be cardiac related, although there are usually other symptoms that go with that, such as profound fatigue, nausea, etc. The pain would also be  prolonged, at least 20 minutes at a time, and would most likely be aggravated by exercise. For these reasons, this also needs to be looked at and ruled out. I think seeing a cardiologist would be a very good idea, as it would either uncover any serious underlying problem (which seems unlikely but is not impossible) or would ease your mind considerably.  Oh, sudden cessation of a beta blocker (auch as atenolol) can cause or aggravate existing chest pain -- please get those pills replaced ASAP).   I suspect you're probably quite healthy (and congratulations on the weight loss, although I hope you won't lose any more quite so quickly as the first 20). I do hope you'll follow up with a cardiologist just to make  sure everything is in order. MVP could actually account for all the symptoms (or most of them) and if so, the atenolol would be the drug of choice to manage them.   I hope this  is helpful to you. Good luck to you with this,and please let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Throbbing pain with two exposed blue veins upper right chest",
    "content": "Hello -  First a couple of questions: were these veins noticeable  previously? Do you have thin, semi-translucent skin where the vessels are easier to see through it? Loose or hyperflexible joints? Answers to these questions would be a big help in ruling out (or in) certain congenital  problems.  Other than  that, your pains are rather diverse and suggest a number of different origins, all of which probably require individual attention. I notice you take clonazepam and a sleep aid also,  and so am going to assume you suffer from some degree of anxiety chronically. This usually causes people to be far more aware of what they're bodies are doing, especially when their bodies are misbehaving.   If the blue veins definitely were not visible  before, and if they change further (this would be unusual, but if...), should  they become larger or raised, then you should bring this to the attention of your doctor promptly. I honestly have no idea what would cause this,  but it would be unusual enough to warrant a further look for  sure.  As for the other pains (eye, heartburn,etc.), these should be  addressed also by your primary care physician, separately, since they have no apparent connection to each other.  I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Either the pain was precipitated by the lemonade (acid reflux can sometimes be felt in this area by referral), or the pain was coincident with the lemonade and that's confusing the issue.   Some  important facts would be helpful: Could you please describe the character of this pain? Also, is it possible to cause or worsen the pain by manual pressure on the area or by turning your head or moving the arm on the affected side? Is the pain worsened by taking a deep breath? A \"yes\" answer to any of these rules out cardiac problems.   Is the pain worsened during exertion? Does it respond to antacid or GERD medications? Knowing these things would also help.   Do you feel any nausea, dizziness, shortness of breath or radiation of the pain down your arm? Sweating? If the answer to any of these is yes, get yourself to an ER at once and don't take any chances. Preferably, if in the US, just dial 9-1-1 and let them do all the work. If none of these things are happening, please get back to us with the other information as soon  as you can. This may well be GI in origin, but it can be difficult to tell without knowing the answers to the above questions.  Hope this is helpful and that you're feeling better.

    "content": "For about a week now I have had this major pressure with pain in the left side of my chest above my left breast and under the left collar bone (general area).  The same feeling is also in my upper back above my left shoulder blade near my shoulder and neck.  I am so scared that it may be heart related.  I am a 29 year old, single mother of 4 small children.  When I was pregnant with my youngest child, who is now 3 1/2, I was diagnosed with mild dilated cardiomyopathy.  My injection fraction got as low as 40% during my pregnancy and by the time my son was a year old everything was back to 100%.  I go to the cardiologist every 9-12 months for a check up.  I ran out of the medications I was on (apresoline and coreg) and when I went to have them refilled they wanted $200 and there was no way I could afford to have them refilled, so I have stopped taking the meds.  I left my husband of 9 years at the end of April 2008 and started smoking about 2 months later because of all the stress, I stopped smoking at the beginning of December and started back up 2 weeks later and have just recently stopped again and plan on never touching a cigarette again, my health and being here for my kids is much more important.  I have only been off my meds for maybe 2 months but continued to take my anxiety medication (klonipin) up until a few weeks ago when that ran out.  I sat down last night and decided it was time for me to make my life healthier by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, I started this morning and plan on sticking to it.  I am 5'8\" and weigh 140 lbs.  There is history of heart disease on both sides of my family and just recently my sister had some heart testing done because she was having problems.  I don't know if it is heart related or maybe just muscle tension.  If there is a Dr in the house that can recommend anything, please do, any questions about my health or history, please ask.  I need to know if I should be worried.  I would go to my Dr in a heart beat but I already have an outstanding bill with him and can't afford another one.  PLEASE HELP!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Well  I'm not an MD, but I am a cardiology tech with very deep experience in the field and in clinical settings. Hopefully I can help you out here.  The pain or pressure you describe most certainly could be heart related. Between your own very distinct heart history and your positive family history, there is probably some mild dilated cardiomyopathy still, although if mild it can, sometimes, be reversed to some extent, especially with a supervised cardiac rehab regimen of monitored, supervised, progressive exercise. That's one. You've covered the smoking, so no sermon is forthcoming. You know there's no room for that in your life. Your height and weight are fine. You've been through some very stressful life events recently, so that has to be taken into consideration. All in all, this has been a really bad time to go off your meds, but especially Coreg, which is a beta blocker. Any member of this class of drugs should never be stopped abruptly, so this may actually account for your symptoms. Cessation of Klonopin may also be contributing to your  discomfort, although it's not as literally dangerous to stop it as it is the Coreg. Klonopin, by the way, is available in generic form as clonazepam, and costs a good deal less that way. This would be very helpful with  managing anxiety and stress which has to be at a pretty high level for you right now. Your heart doesn't need that and neither does the rest of you.   If you could find a way to afford to resume the Coreg and clonazepam (generic Klonopin) at least, then you'd be mostly back on track. Apresoline (hydrazaline) is probably important to your care program as well, but if you have to pick and choose to make things optimum, until you can find some assistance for medication costs, the Coreg would be number one and clonazepam would come in second, I would think.   You also need to be evaluated right now for the pain/pressure, even though it is atypical in presentation. In young, otherwise healthy women, cardiac pain is most often atypical anyway, so nothing can be taken for granted. With your history and your family history absolutely nothing can be assumed. Please be seen, even if you can't pay right now. You can't be refused care if you need it. If your doctor won't work with you during this period of financial difficulty, then go to an ER to be evaluated for this problem; you can't be refused because of inability to pay, and even if you're billed, if there's no money then you don't pay the bill, but you do stay alive and well, which is absolutely the number one priority.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please stay in touch with us here and update us as needed. Best of luck to you. Your kids need you and you're young and have been through a lot and deserve to be able to enjoy your kids, your life, and to look forward to positive change. Hang in there.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for replying to my post.  I was very worried about everything.  I started an exercise and healthy eating plan on Monday and after 3 days, other than soreness of muscles, I am starting to feel a little better.  I am going to call my cardiologist taday and see if he can call me in the coreg or even something generic just like it , if they have such a thing.  The apresoline I don't really think I need, it was for high blood pressure during my last pregnancy and I haven't had any problems with my blood pressure since.  The klonipin, I try not to take if I don't have to anyway because I know too many people who have become dependent on that drug and I don't want to become dependent on any kind of drug.  Thank you for your advice you have been very helpful.\n\n",

I suspect you don't need the apresoline either, and there are lots of adequate beta blockers, many now available in generic form, that might suffice as a replacement for Coreg (although that one does have some unique qualities -- it just doesn't seem like those would apply to your case anyway). I'm glad to hear everything is starting to settle down. All in all, pretty good news.   You are very welcome. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Tightness in chest since stopping vicodin",
    "content": "A couple months ago, I was prescribed vicodin by my dentist for some tooth pain I was having. I took it for a couple days, then stopped. Two days later, I had a massive panic attack. I ended up in the emergency room because I thought I was dying. I had a couple EKGs done along with some basic blood work, and everything looked normal except for a branch bundle block that I've had for years. I was dismissed.   I continued having minor panic attacks, with tightness in the chest, tingling and numbness in the arms and hands, and dizziness, for about a week. After that, I had recurring tightness in my chest for about three weeks. I had a follow-up check-up with my doctor, who did a general exam, ran a lipid panel, and an a1c. He said everything looked great. By Thanksgiving, all my symptoms were gone, and they stayed gone for a month.   Now, I've just had a tooth infection, and I thought I'd try the vicodin again, just in case that's not what caused all this (I was in a ton of pain!). I was on the vicodin this time for several days. When I stopped taking it, some of the tingling in my hands came back, along with the tightness in my chest, shortness of breath, etc.   It's been over a week now since I've been off the vicodin, and I'm not having any panic/anxiety symptoms, but the tightness/squeezing feeling in my chest still comes and goes, sometimes with a little lightheadedness. It was gone all day yesterday, but it's back again today. Activity doesn't seem to make a difference, as I can be sitting doing nothing and the feeling will come over me, or I can be out for a long walk and feel nothing at all.  I talked to my dentist, who prescribed the vicodin, and he said that I might just be very sensitive to opiates, and I could be going through somewhat of a withdrawal, even though I wasn't on the drug for very long.  But I keep worrying about my heart. What if it's NOT just the vicodin? My dad had a heart attack recently, and is 55. I'm 25 years old, but my lipoprotein (a) was 76 mg/dl when I was 21, so I worry that I've developed heart disease early or something. Other than the Lp(a), my lipids are good and I'm in good shape.  Any help would be appreciated!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Tightness in chest since stopping vicodin",
    "content": "Hi there -  Here's what seems to be going on: you are probably \"wired\" for panic disorder, but are only on the fence with it (so far, so good); use of Vicodin probably upsets this balance because it has a slight sedative effect. If you're already tensed up or anxious (maybe not realizing it, since it can be your \"baseline\" status), then using Vicodin briefly then discontinuing it could be just enough to upset the balance and allow you to feel panic symptoms. It may also be sheer coincidence, but since it's happened twice I think there is sufficient cause-and-effect evidence for this hyptothesis to hold up.   If you are, in fact, suffering from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) along with frank panic disorder (PD), then it may just be evolving into a higher gear, and the Vicodin may have just pushed things over the edge. While you have a positive family history for early heart disease, you're still quite young to have had time to develop significant heart disease. Also, the lipoprotein (a) isn't sufficently high to be considered significant (it needs to be >90, and even then only if the overall LDL is high -- >160).  You haven't given us your LDL nor total cholesterol numbers, which would be useful for baseline purposes, but your lipoprotein (a) isn't  high enough, as yet, to be classified as a risk. It is higher than what one would expect, and needs to be followed, but it still only has meaning in the light of how high the overall LDL is.   I think you are beginning to experience both chronic and acute anxiety/panic problems, and it's pretty clear Vicodin plays some role in aggravating them. I'd avoid that if at all possible, since things seem to be quieter when you haven't taken it, and you can't take it as a remedy for anxiety/panic. There are alternative pain meds that are similar; otherwise, if you should need this sort of pain med again, perhaps you should just prepare yourself to expect some agitation after using it.  So here's a plan  to consider: see someone for management of anxiety/panic disorder, while it's still relatively mild. At the same time, recognize you may have a future risk of premature heart disease and have at least annual cholesterol and homosyctein/CRP checks. Maintain a healthy diet and stay in shape. See your denstist regularly to avoid development of sytemic inflammatory problems which could affect your heart in the future and at the same time avoid infected teeth, etc. Teeth are so much easier to maintain when there's a dentist involved.   I hope this is  helpful to you. I don't think you have any current heart problems, but there is a low to moderate risk of future problems which probably is completely manageable since you'll be on top of it. Best of luck to you and  stay in touch with us.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Tightness in chest since stopping vicodin",
    "content": "Thanks so much for the reply. The chest symptoms seem to be diminishing more, though I still have some very small tightening sensations every now and then. Definitely less, than a few days ago, to be sure. I rubbed my chest a lot of of nervousness, I think, and now it feels bruised. It's sometimes hard to distinguish whether the discomfort is coming from within or without! I also kept thinking (hoping!)that perhaps this was a weird case of costochondritis or something, so I would be looking for sore spots sensitive to pressure and palpating. I think I over-palpated. Haha.  I also thought that perhaps this was related to my teeth. Both times this has happened, I also had some infection due to a cracked/abscessed tooth (which was painful-- which is why I took the vicodin). A touch of endocarditis, perhaps? I'm taking antibiotics, and I had the tooth pulled yesterday. The symptoms continue to decrease. I still think the vicodin seems to have a noticeable effect since the reaction is so pronounced, predictable, and so close in proximity to the cessation of the drug. Maybe it's a both/and instead of an either/or?  Also, I would not consider myself a generally anxious person, but I guess I have had an enormous amount of stress in my life over the last year or so. I got married, my wife and I have miscarried several times, I lost my job, my grandfather died, and my dad had a heart attack. And then there are these teeth that are giving me problems (bad filling and a cracked/failed root canal-- both fixed now). That's mostly all in the last half of 2008. I wonder if I was just at my breaking point?  I don't have my lipid results right here in front of me, but I can generally remember the results. My total cholesterol was around 180. LDL: under 100. HDL: around 70. Triglycerides: under 100. Last I checked, CRP was 1.0 mg/L. I can't remember the exact homocysteine result. I think it was around 5.0 umol/L. I can say with absolute certainty that it was under 7.0 umol/L.  I will definitely avoid the vicodin from now on. My dentist suggested that as well, and I'm practically afraid to even look at the stuff! When I had my tooth extracted yesterday, I requested that they not give me a prescription for anything with hydrocodone in it (or any of the codeines, for that matter), so they gave me darvocet. I'm afraid to take it though, just because I'm finally feeling better and I'm frightened of even the slim chance of experiencing those symptoms again. Panic attacks are incredibly scary, and so are the chest symptoms.  So I just take ibuprofen, and that seems to work well enough.  Again, thanks so much for your help. I'll let you know if I have any more questions, but for now, things do seem to be looking up. Feeling a little better, and not quite so worried. Thanks again.\n\n",

Everything else I said previously I would refer you back to.

    "content": "18, Male, good health, no pre-existing conditions to speak of.   I recently was hit in the chest while working in my garage. Without explaining how it happened the impact was similar to a 10 pound weight being dropped onto my chest from 20 feet high. The impact was over the heart but closest to the sternum. It spans about 8 inches vertically but hurts the most over the heart. The pain heightens when I breathe in deep or stretch the area. It has been 10 days and I feel better everyday. I haven't felt any difference in my heart though I haven't been able to exercise yet to fully test it.  At the hospital they found that I have a LEFT bundle branch blockage. My dad has a right bundle branch blockage.   Is my blockage most likely genetic or could it be from the impact? If it isn't genetic is medical care needed? Should I see a cardiologist?

    "title": "Re: Left Bundle Branch Blockage from impact?",
    "content": "Hi there -  First, it will help with future discussions with other medical people, to straighten out the terminology: what you're talking about is left bundle branch block (LBBB), not blockage. This is an important distinction,  as blockages involve arteries feeding parts of the heart, while a \"block\" is an electrical problem, in this case the left ventricle beating just a hair after the right one instead of both at the exact same time.   Since there's a history of BBB in  your family (your dad's RBBB is generally of less concern) this could be some sort of inherited thing, but LBBB is often associated with congenital defects or injuries, so most all patients with LBBB are worked up for structural defects and specific details of their block as well, since it is a more complicated issue than RBBB. It also could be a result of the blow to the chest, since cardiac trauma is often overlooked and not always symptomatic except for the orthopedic pain caused by the blow. You seem to be recovering nicely, so if this bundle branch block disappears, it may have been related to the injury (and that would have been quite a hit! You're very lucky it didn't knock the heart out of rhythm). So what you'll need now, in order to determine why this is showing up, is to have an EKG (you've already had that done), an echocardiogram (an ultrasound  look at the inside structures of the heart), and bloodwork to determine if you have some irritation or injury to the heart muscle or the sac around the  heart.  This could account for the pain you're feeling, although it's just as likely superficial bone and soft tissue trauma. It's important to be certain there's no injury to the heart itself. If there isn't, once the discomfort has resolved you'll need to be followed for this problem, as some people have LBBB for no apparent reason  and it can eventually become a problem requiring a pacemaker. While this is far from a sure thing in your case, since it may be due to the thing falling on  your chest, it also could be a congenital problem. Again, right bundle branch block, such as your father has, is generally not a problem. LBBB can be moreso in some cases.   It's impossible to say if this was there before the accident,  so it's very important to determine whether or not that's what caused it, as it may well go away if that's what caused it. Otherwise you'll need to be followed up by a cardiologist over time to make sure it doesn't progress to a more troublesome sort of block.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you with this and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Extreme Chest Pain (left side) and Left Arm Tightness",
    "content": "Hello.  I hope you can provide me some insight for my situation.  For about 3 months now, I have been experiencing anxiety problems and chest and left arm pain.  This first began to manifest itself when I contracted mono from my 6 month old nephew (end of September).  I would have small bouts of extreme nervousness and anxeity which I read online can be caused by mono, so I just passed it off as a symptom and thought it would pass once the mono had ran its course.  However, I never really had any other symptoms from the mono...I would get tired but I could still manage to do all my daily activities, which included exercising and full 8 hour work day.  My doctor gave me xanax to help wih the anxiety and I went on my way.   Well, during the month of November, I noticed that these panic attacks became more frequent (daily) and always seemd to revolove around when I would eat (when I would get hungry or after I eat a large meal).  The \"attacks\" aslo seemed to change from just feelings of anxeity to total exhaustion, EXTREME dizziness and lightheadedness, a \"flushing\" or adrenaline rush feeling over my body for 30 to 45 mintues at a time, difficulty remembering and speaking at times and chest pain and left arm tightness began.  So, I decided to go to a cardiologist and they gave me an EKG, Echo test and Stress test...all of which came back normal.  I still kept having the attacks, but I would just take xanax for them which I don't like doing because they just make me fall asleep.  Now to current, at the beginning of the month of December, the \"attacks\" changed again to what feels like im about to have a full blown heart attack and they seem to get worse each one I have.  I can be doing nothing or in the middle of telling a joke and almost instantly, my left arm will tighten up, chest will begin to almost \"clinch\" and then pulse with pain (right over my heart on the left side), breathing becomes difficult or tight and I get dizzy and confused easily.  As a result of this new, more difficult to handle \"attack\", I went to the emergency room becasue I thought I was about to pass out during one of them.  They ran and EGK, did blood work, CT scan of head and X-ray of chest and all came back normal.  They said to visit a nueroligist, so I went and had him run blood work for a possible thyroid imbalance...however, it came back normal too.  This brings me today (12/31).  I had an extremely bad attack yesterday and it has lingered since 6pm last night to this morning.  While my symptoms are not as bad (mainly becasue I have taken 1mg of xanax) they are still around.  I am at a stand still as to what to do next.  This has become a debilitating problem as I cant leave my house without a xanax in my pocket and I am afraid to go to out and have fun for fear of the next attack since they are progessively getting worse.  I hate taking Xanax becasue it just puts me to sleep or makes me \"foggy\".  One important fact is that I have only had to stop exercising once because of an \"attack\"...usually I can workout without any problems but the one time I did have to stop, I felt like I was going to pass out IMMEDIATELY once I began running on the treadmill. I don't workout if I feel like I am about to have one of these attacks.  I have to take my xanax before bedtime so that it will still be in my system when I workout in the morning...otherwise I wake up with the symptoms I mentioned earlier.   I have two questions: 1. Do I need to see a psychologist or specialist for anxiety or is this possibly a physical problem that I have not addressed or been tested for? 2. Is there any drug that you would reccommend I can suggest to my general care doctor that would work better than Xanax at managing these \"attacks\"?      A few things about me and my family: - father had a heart attack at 39, triple bypass at 49 - sister is diabetic and wears an insulin pump - grandmother died of heart attack at 72 - I have had high cholesterol (once at 253) but took lipitor for some time and lowered it to 151.  I stopped lipitor once I began having these problems - I have used drugs and alcohol in th past but never been addicted, it was more a social and weekend thing - Despite the sporadic alcohol and drug use, I workout and diet daily...I have done this since I was 15 - I have ran 2 marathons in the last year (12/07 and 2/08) and participate in sprint triathlons and 5-10K, often on the weekends - I work as a motgage banker, which can be very stressful but has never been an issue in the past - I am 30 years old, single male with a MBA and also help run a start up business...all of which sounds stressful but I find fun and enjoyable   Thank you for time and any insight you can provide.   -C\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Extreme Chest Pain (left side) and Left Arm Tightness",
    "content": "Hello -  First, thanks for your detailed and comprehensive post. While there are things in it that would naturally be suggestive of a heart problem, that seems to have been ruled out -- for now. Since you have a history of elevated cholesterol and a family history of early heart disease, I would suggest you restart the Lipitor at once, as that is one of several things you have working in your favor (your lipid reduction was typically dramatic, and that's how you want it to stay).   As for the symptoms, they are somewhat different from most panic attacks in that they mimic more accurately a \"real\" heart attack -- almost to a fault, actually. The fact that the pain is felt over your left chest would lessen the likelihood of this being heart related, but that's now been more than ruled out anyway. Panic attacks can certainly cause very real chest pain (usually felt on the left side, by the way). This is partly due to tension, partly due to unwitting use of accessory muscles in the course of hyperventilating (again, usually unwittingly, sometimes knowingly but because the subject believes he is not gettiing enough air), and partly due to muscle tetany secondary to hyperventilation (which can also cause sensations of numbness or tingling in the hands and around the mouth, along with lightheadedness).   The fact that you generally tolerate your daily workout with no symptoms is one more argument against heart disease (at least active heart disease, again noting your family history, which means you'd be wise to be followed by a cardiologist on at least an annual basis). The \"last nail\" would be that all this responds to Xanax. The problems with Xanax are several, although it is a most excellent \"rescue\" drug. First, it is primarily a rescue drug intended to abort panic attacks, not prevent them, and secondly, it can have a strong sedative effect in many people, as you have experienced. I wouldn't ditch them, as they may carry you through an awkward situation while out (or at home for that matter), but you definitely could benefit from both something to (temporarily at least) stabilize and perhaps prevent the attacks (either an SSRI antidepressant, any one of several could be tried) or clonazepam, a long-acting relative of Xanax which is a maintainance drug and is taken twice a day to ward off panic attacks. My personal preference is the latter, since the side-effects are minimal (generally less or no noticeable, significant sedative effect); While SSRI meds work well for many people, they are slow to \"kick in\", usually require some dosing adjustment, and can, in people with acute anxiety problems, actually exacerbate the issue during early use.   All this could be worked out with a psychiatrist or psychopharmacologist, in conjuntion with a therpaist who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a self-limiting, interactive form of psychotherapy which actually teaches the patient how to manage the problem (in your case panic attacks, in others either generalized anxiety or depression), and then, given those tools, the patient can avoid open-ended talk therapy which can go on for years. (Nothing wrong with talk therapy, but CBT has its place also).   I would stress, however, restarting the Lipitor ASAP, and having an annual cardiolgical checkup because of family history. Other than that, in order to get back to enjoying life to the fullest, you'll need to get this current problem under management, and the plan spelled out above, I think, would probably work wonders. I don't think your MBA and startup business status need be overly stressful at all, although some insight into where it might be (via CBT) probably wouldn't hurt and might actually aid in the enjoyment of it. Mainly, you need to be able to enjoy all aspects of your life, and panic disorder will certainly bring things to a screeching halt. Foruntately it is manageable, if not technically \"cureable\" and the proper medication (with Xanax kept handy for breakthrough symptoms early on) and CBT, together could pretty much eliminate this before it begins to really hamstring your life.  Best of luck to you. Thanks for bringing your questions here, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the quick reply.  It was very helpful.  I do have one more question I forgot to ask earlier.  Why do I get these panic attacks at odd moments?  Or why do I get them when im not stressed out? It seems logical that I would get them when I am very busy at work or having stress in a relationship, but I don't.  I get them while im daydreaming at work or watching TV at home....it literally happens in seconds.  It is this inability to determine when I might have another one that makes it so tough to manage and adds to the symptoms...   Thank you again.\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome and you pose an excellent question -- for which I just happen to have an answer, since this is a very common issue for PD sufferers.  While panic attacks can be brought on by situational stress or an upward anxiety spiral, they are most notable for their apparently coming \"out of nowhere.\" They are extremely common when seeming nothing untoward is going on. There is some controversy about why this is, with some arguing it is the result of subconscious concerns playing out \"under the radar\", while others suggest, rightfully so, that panic attacks are a seizure-like event, originating in the temporal lobe of the brain, and so can come on without any intellectual content being involved. I strongly suspect both are right and probably more often than not it is a combination of the two, but based on observation alone, I tend to favor the second explanation as being the more common one. This would account for why this problem responds so well to certain anti-seizure drugs, specifically clonazepam.  In either case, you are far from alone in wondering about this, as it is a classic part of the usual panic attack patient's narrative.  I hope this answers your question. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you agsin for responding to my last question.  You have been extremely helpful.  I think ive learned more from your replies than visiting all the different doctros ive have seen through the course of all this.  I did have one more question and it is about the Xanax.  I didnt stress in my initial reply that since these attacks became more serious in the beginning of December, I have to take the Xanax everyday.  I have the 1mg blue generic ablets (alprazolam) and I usually break them up into quarters or halves and take 1 qtr in the morning, one in the afternoon and then a full half before bed.  If I don't do this this, then it almost like clock work, I will get them above mentioned symptoms everytime.  I have to carry one in my pocket incase the last dose I took itsnt enough and doesnt completely work...and this happens about every two or three days too (one of these happened on 12/30 and then prompted me to write my initial post that morning on 12/31).  Is it posible to just feel like this permenantly?  And not necessarliy have it just in an \"attack\" form that comes and goes? (the chest pain, shortness of breath, exhaustion, over all depressed feeling and high anxiety).  I wanted to make sure it was understood that I basically have to live on the Xanax to function.  Thank you once again.\n\n",

    "title": "frequent lightheadedness and more....",
    "content": "Hello, my name is Bill and I have had a rough last year and a half.    A little history first.  I am a 30 yr. old male and up until my story begins 1.5 yrs. ago I had no medical problems.  I have prehypertension for the last 10 yrs right around the 130/80.  Nothing too serious.  I did not take medicine at the time.    It all started when I took a workout supplement called firballz from Vitamin World.  It was a fat  burner and also an energy booster pill.  I discontinued the pill after a week as it was making me dizzy and really short tempered.  The problem was that I never really recovered.  Within a week later I was at work (and I have always worked in sales standing up) and it was so bad I went to the emergency room.  I felt as though I was about to pass out, sweating, confused and my left arm was tingling.  The e.r. took my b.p. which was 179/112 and then made me wait an hour before they took me back.  I could barely stand up.  My b.p. then was 160/100.  They gave me salene and sent me home.  Knowing what I know now about possible heart conditions etc. I can not believe they didn't even give me an ekg.  I then followed up with primary physician who put me on lisinopril 20mg for b.p.  I had an echocardiogram done with normal findings.  They checked my blood sugar and it was fine.  Blood work came back normal.  Not sure what all they checked.  Two weeks from first emergency room I was back in a different e.r.  The entire I could not make it but 100 ft. or so before I felt lightheaded.  They checked things out and kept me over night and said I was fine.  However I told them while in the hospital I passed a tarry stool.  They still released me.  LOL.  I was home for 2 hours and luckily my friend was still there when I passed another toilet full of bright red blood.  As I was going out to tell him I barely remember making it to the couch before blanking out.  I came to almost instantly and back off to the e.r. I went.  Now they knew something was wrong.  Within 30 hours I had passed so much blood 3 pints of packed r.b.c's were given to me.  Tests concluded a duodenal ulcer which was not bleeding at the time.  Also lower endoscopy revealed a malignant polyp that they removed.  Things did get a little better after that but I never been able to stand for periods of time since.  I was out for  another month after leaving the hospital before I was able to return for a half day of work before leaving due to lightheadedness and fatigue.  To this day I stay constantly fatigued and get lightheaded when walking the distance of 1000ft. or so or doing sufficiant talking.  I just remembered they also gave me a stress test afterwards and I stopped it when I felt bad on the 2nd tier.  My b.p. on the screen was 207/125.  I was later told they should have stopped it after I passed 200 on the systolic.    The problem I now face is that I no longer have insurance.  So I can't just go get the full work up right now looking for clues.  I just recently paid off what was done to me in the past.  Loads of reading on the internet and led me to believe it could be anxiety, which doesn't make sense to me, Orthostatic intolerance, which I have many of the symptoms of, or something related to my G.I. tract.  I forgot to mention that I had liquidy stools for over 4 yrs. but had related it to \"beer *****\" as I used to bring beer 3-4 nights a week.  Please excuse the expression.  The liquid stools continued after I quit drinking and still persist today.  I had a friend in general ultrasound who scanned my guts at her site for me on the side and she said my liver and gall bladder looked ok from an ultrasound perspective but she could not see my intestines because it was full of sludge and gas.  This was done 3 weeks ago.  Also around this time I was leaving work one night and as I was walking to my car my heart went into an arrhythmia.  It lasted for 45 seconds.  There was no pain associated but I could feel everything beating independently of each other.  It scared the jeepers out of me.  This has so far been an isolated incident.  As of the last 2 weeks I have noticed a small dull pain under my left armpit and a prickly sensation on the top of my left hand and on the palm side of my forarm.  Similar to carpal tunnel.  I have monitored my b.p. every night and morning and it has never exceeded around 145/85.  My resting pulse stays around 52 b.p.m.  I just want to find the answer so I can enjoy life again.  I was very active under I started taking those cursed pills.  I am scared to go on vacation and I can not go places involving a lot of walking.  Laying down seems lessen the symptoms and in most cases resolves them within an hour or so.  My Dr. was at a loss and still trying different things when my insurance ran out.  I am sorry for this long novel but I am trying to be as accurate as possible.  I have included a list of symptoms I have suffered from since the pills below.  Thank you very much for your reply and time,  Bill   Symptoms:  Fatigue shortness of breath sweating upon lightheaded spells lightheadedness left arm tingling diarrhea the one instance of g.i. bleeding 15 pound weight loss since. feeling of anxiety weakness occasional palpitations exercise intolorance on 3 occasions I have woke up on my back with both hands and sometimes feet numb.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: frequent lightheadedness and more....",
    "content": "Hi Bill -  Not a good time to lose your insurance, but it happens all the time. We just never know. The only real problem here is that while many of your symptoms could be due to anxiety, I don't think all of them are, and there is some overlap of possibilities.   One thing I find interesting is that quite often people are told they won't \"feel\" any symptoms  with high blood pressure, but many do, and of those many, a significant number seem to feel lightheaded, as though their pressures should actually be low. This contradicts most \"facts\" about hypertension, except for one: anxiety. Anxiety can cause lightheadedness via other means, even as the BP goes through the roof. This is one reason I suspect part of your problem is anxiety-related. However, any person can have more than one thing going on at the same time (witness your GI bleed, which was significant, yet probably has nothing to do with your other symptoms).   By the way, I've done an extensive websearch for \"firballz\", \"fireballz\",  etc., and can find nothing related to any sort of fat burner supplement, but I did  find, on the Vitamin World site a fat burner called \"Fireball Liqui-Fusion\" which only states the following: Precision Engineered\u00ae Fireball Liqui-Fusion Designed with the purpose of creating a thermogenic, metabolic stimulator that\u2019s as strong as they come.  While supplements containing ephedra have been mostly removed from the market due to the dangers associated with that component, Vitamin World is trying to make Fireball Liqui-Fusion sound at least as potent as ephedra, and suggest further on that it works in much the same way (by deliberately vague description of its mechanism). This was probably the catalyst for the blood pressure and (likely) anxiety problems, though I can't ascribe the GI bleed to it in any obvious way.  Your stomach ulcer seems to have healed,  but thank goodness you persisted with that or you'd have, at best, wound  up feeling terrible and quite possibly more than that.  Keep an eye out for any future signs of GI bleeds and, as you've done in the past, go to the ER if that should recur.   As for untangling the other symptoms, this may require some additional medical detective work not possible on-line. For instance, while you seem to have your blood pressure back to roughly where it was, and may have calmed your (presumed) anxiety a good deal, you're still having some symptoms that shouldn't be happening (like the striking exercise intolerance). I could go on a rant about healthcare and insurance, but this isn't a political forum, so I'll keep that to myself. However, the inability to tolerate exercise does concern me, and I'm going to do some more looking into Fireball Liqui-Fusion, to see if it could have had any lasting effects.   I take it your stress test was normal up til the point you felt the need to stop (and at which your BP was getting rather high).   For the time being I'd suggest you continue doing what you're doing, exercise if you can, but don't push beyond what you feel is comfortable, and work on either getting health insurance or, at the least, try to find a doctor who may be willing to work with you on this, to rule out (or in) a physiogical cause for your symptoms. At the very least you might be able to be put on a beta blocking drug to help manage the blood pressure and some of the other symptoms until a more clear picture can be drawn of just what's going on.  As for the GI symptoms, I think that's a whole other thing, and of course needs to be followed as well, but not acutely, at least not at the moment. The other things you mentioned, the localized pain under your armpit and the prickly sensation in yor left hand, are things most people have from time to time, but you're noticing them because you've becomed more attuned to what your body is doing, a by-product of anxiety. This does not mean you have nothing serious going on, only that it is going to be masked, to some extent, by any anxiety you're experiencing. Then again, it could all be anxiety-related, which would be great. However, we don't  know that.   I hope this is helpful to you. It sounds like you at least have the situation stabilized for now, except for that exercise intolerance. A thorough cardiopulumonary workup is definitely in order, but how you'll get that to happen will have to depend on how resourceful (or lucky) you may be.  Best  of luck to you. Please follow up here as needed, and keep us updated as well.\n\n",

    "content": "Well let begin first by telling you thank you very much for your reply.  I did my own control study after typing this to you with a remarkable result.  As I listed my symptoms at the bottom of my first post something snapped in my head.  Almost all of those were side effects of the lisinopril I was taking including some rare cases of a swollen abdomen.  I stopped taking the medication for the first time since I was put on it.  Low and behold by day two I had NO DIZZINESS!  I had energy for the first time in over a year.  My general condition improved dramatically and was starting to feel normal.    However, on day 4 I had an incident.  Just after reaching sexual climax a sharp intense pain arrose in the back of my head on the left posterior side.  It was a pulsating pain which made me want to scream with every heart beat.  Of coarse I monitored my bp and within a few minutes it went to 151/88.  I do realize pain will raise your bp and I didn't see that very threatening.  The pain grew and went from that spot into my left ear and jaw.  Then it continued down my left carotid and I could feel the carotid was tighter than the rt. carotid.  The pain was relentless.  I sat up in bed trying to keep as much pressure away from my head until the pain lessened.  Finally I ended up taking a lisinopril and within 30 minutes the pain went away.  I did notice hearing some running water sounds in the back of my neck as the pressure subsided.  I am not sure if the bp med did the trick because it is my understanding the med as a slow onset.  I was wondering if that may have been due to my body adjusting from cutting out the lisinopril cold turkey?\n\n",

    "content": "Well, that was mostly good news. The bloated stomach went right by me, what with all the more disturbing symptoms. I'm glad to hear the cause-and-effect between lisinopril and the dizziness has been established. As for the sudden headache (with moderately elevated BP secondary), you're probably right about it being due to the abrupt cessation of lisinopril (and again, cause-and-effect strongly suggests this), so perhaps you'll need to taper that med if you do decide to do without it. This is potentially very useful information for others who may have had similar experiences with the same (or similar) drug.   Thanks for this update. Please continue to let us know how this plays out, and for now we'll hope for the best. It seems you've solved the original puzzle and the subsequent one as well.\n\n",

    "title": "Heart rate drops when I stand up?!",
    "content": "I need some answers.  When I was pregnant in 2006 I found I that I have low blood pressure.  My OBGYN said it wasn't low enough to worry so I just ignored it.  In 2007 I started having dizzy spells.  One was so bad that my parents took me to the ER because the spinning in my head was causing me to vomit uncontrollably.  They did a cat scan, gave me fluids, and put me on meds for nausea and dizziness.  I only took the meds the first day because I couldn't care for my son and he's breastfed.   They diagnosed me with vertigo and said they basically can't do anything for me.   I recently went to a chiropractor for a pinched nerve in my shoulder.  The took my blood pressure and noticed it was low.   Then they had me ly down and took it again, it was higher while lying down.  They tested it out a few times and got the same result every time.   My question is, is there anything I can do about this?   My heart beats faster when I lay down, I can feel it pounding when I try to go to sleep.  They when I stand up, I get SO dizzy sometimes I have to not move for a minute.  I'm otherwise healthy as far as I know.  I eat healthy and I'm young (22).  I want to work out, but I can't because every time I try I feel as though I'm going to pass out.  Then when I lay down to rest after a run, my heart rate goes up and I can't catch my breathe.  I'm so confused!   Why is this so backwards?!   I hate this because I want more energy, I have a 2 year old so I need it! Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Heart rate drops when I stand up?!",
    "content": "Hi there -  It sounds as though you have a paradoxical situation going on that seems to happen more often in women than men, and which involves the baroreceptors in your neck just below your ears, as well as their partner nerves in the heart itself. This is inappropriate or \"backward\" regulation of the blood pressure and heart rate. While not dangerous it can be very disruptive (as you've obviously noticed). You may need to be seen by a cardiologist who will do a tilt-table test to establish the diagnosis. If you're positive in this test you have what's often  now referred to as neurocardiogenic syncope or dysautonomia. It sounds very much like it from your description, and it often responds to medication. It's also compatable in most cases  with a progressive exercise program, but one that starts out very slowly and works up to regular levels.   You may (or maybe have had) vertigo in the past, but what's happening now sounds a lot more like  paradoxical baroreceptor behavior,  which is exactly backward. The  good news is it's not life-threatening, at least not directly (if you pass out you could, of course,  strike your head, but most people  are aware enough to avoid this happening), it is quite disruptive.   I hope you'll arrange for a cardiology consult with an eye toward the tilt-table test. I think this would probably clear  up a lot of things and,  with a proper diagnosis, you could have this managed and be able to get on with your normal life.   Hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Heart Rate for 2 years old kid",
    "content": "Hello -  While complete heart block will rarely correct itself (usually it means there is some damageto, or failure to fully develop some part of the heart's electrical system) and therefore a pacemaker is almost always required; and since the rate was uniformly slow for a child of the age of two heart block would seem convincing; the fact that the rate varied over 24 hours some 40 beats per minute. In complete heart block the rate is determined by the ventricles at a slow, fixed, \"escape\" rate and rhythm that doesn't vary by much. The average rate was 70, which, again, is slow for a child of this age, and suggestive of some sort of block, but the variation is so great that complete heart block is clearly intermittent (or as the report states, is \"intermittently paced\"). While this is not a status of complete heart block, it is likely to progress to that point, and even if it remains intermittent, as the child grows and the rate slows, this will become, even if intermittent, a great problem which will interfere with function and could lead to life-threatening problems in adulthood (or earlier). A demand pacemaker programmable to full-time pacing if needed would seem the best solution. While this probably seems extreme in such a small child, as he grows he will \"grow into\" his pacemaker, and by adolescence, when he is totally used to its presence anyway, it will seem much smaller and far less cumbersome and intrusive than it will during early childhood. But mainly, it will allow him a relatively normal life and activities.   Given the facts as reported by the cardiology technician and signed off by the doctor, I would say yes, definitely this is a case where a pacemaker would be not only necessary but perhaps even life-saving over the long term. The only (minor) annoyance, beyond early childhood adaptation to the pacer's presence, would be the occasional office visits for pacer checking and the battery replacements, every few years (which, over time, will probably become less frequent).   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "chest pain, hurts to breathe, last only 30-45 minutes",
    "content": "I am a 26 yr old female.  I was diagnosed with neurally mediated hypotension in 2005 through tilt table testing.  I have never passed out from low blood pressure.  I was placed on Atenolol (50 mg) once a day and Fludrocortisone (0.1 mg) twice daily.  I was also diagnosed with a very mild form of sleep apnea (it took 2 sleep studies to come to this diagnosis).  Since July 28th, I've had 6 episodes in which I have a stabbing pain that starts in the middle of my back and goes to my chest.  It hurts to take normal breaths so I take tiny, shallow breaths.  The pain used to last 30-45 minutes but the last 3 times, I have felt the back pain and laid on the couch with my feet up against the wall and taken tiny, shallow breaths until I feel the pain going away.  This seems to help the pain go away faster and tonight when I felt the pain in my chest, I just took shallow breaths and leaned against the counter in the bathroom.  All of the episodes have taken place between 8 pm and 3 am.  I also have a warm feeling during the episodes but when we take my temp at home, there's no fever.  I haven't been able to see the doctor while having an episode because the nearest doctor is 30 minutes away and the pain is usually gone by that time.  I have had lung X-rays done and the doctor said the turned out normal.  At first, we thought the pain was coming because of the pressure setting on my CPAP machine, which I used for the first time when the first incident occured.  We have adjusted the settings to allow an automatic pressure setting.  I have also had 2 episodes that happened during the night when I wasn't using my CPAP and 2 episodes that occured before bed.  I have been sleeping or sitting when all of the episodes have occured and did not stand until after the episodes began.  My CNP is confused as to what may be causing this and think it may be the CPAP machine.  I have also talked to my cardiologist to see if it's the neurally mediated hypotension that is causing this.  He said to come back in if I have another episode.  Do you think these episodes are caused by the hypotension, CPAP or something else?  Thanks for your help!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: chest pain, hurts to breathe, last only 30-45 minutes",
    "content": "Hi there -  This is an interesting complaint. I don't think it's likely caused by either C-pap pressure settings or neurally mediated hypotension, and cardiac pain is almost never manifested this way. However, there is one potential cardiac-related problem that might be causing it, although if it is the case this time, it's behaving in a somewhat backward fashion: that problem would  be pericarditis, an irritation or inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart, sometimes with some fluid collected inside the sac as well. This can cause sharp, stabbing chest pains that can be felt in the back or beneath the sternum, and can be aggravated by breathing and can be positional. This is the \"upside down\" part, as usually pericarditis pain is aggravated by lying supine and relieved by sitting upright and leaning forward. However, since this does seem at least partially positional, it's one thing to consider. You could also have an inflammation of some part of the chest wall (like pleurisy, which can cause pain very similar to pericarditis), or some sort of nerve irritation.   I'd want to rule out cardiac-related causes first, even though pericarditis is rarely very serious (unless following surgery or trauma). It  (as well as pleurisy) responds well to over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain meds such as Advil and Aleve, so that might  be worth a try.   If this continues, the nuisance value alone would be enough to cause you to go back to see the cardiologist, and although I don't think anything serious is going on, it certainly would be worth taking a look to see if for some reason the pericardium is irritated (sometimes a passing virus can even cause this).  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you and please follow up here as needed and update us if anything changes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Candle Smoke, do they damage lungs?",
    "content": "Hi there -  This is a very reasonable question! The generalized answer would be \"no\", but there are some  qualifiers to this. First, where the candles are burning should not be airtight, and the candles should be relatively clean burning (no visible black  smoke, as when one puts out a candle that's been burning).  Decent quality candles in an appropriately well-ventilated room shouldn't cause problems. The problems that  do occur with bad candles or too \"tight\" a room are usually lung (or more often bronchial) irritation in certain senstitive individuals, but not actual damage. If you're not feeling any ill effects from being around  the candles you aren't likely having any such symptoms, and other than that there's really little to be concerned about. It's an excellent question, however, and thanks for asking it!  Hope this is helpful and that you've enjoyed the holidays.\n\n",

    "title": "longterm left side chest pain, lightheadedness, female - 29",
    "content": "Hello -  This started almost three years ago (just before my 27th birthday.) I noticed chest pain on the left... it felt to be directly behind my breast. I also ended up with a sort of electric-feeling going down my left arm, plus it seemed that I could feel the nerves in my teeth. Ever since then I have had occasional dull pain in the same basic area, but it seems to migrate around, always staying on the left side and either above or below my breast area. I have noticed no connections to physical exertion, eating, and I don't think anxiety, but that one I wonder about.  About 3-6 months later I started to notice some dizziness, but it would ONLY happen after I would lie down for bed and had been still for 10-30 seconds. This comes and goes as well... I could go months with it not happening, then have it happen every night for 4 nights. In the last year or two I have noticed being lightheaded while awake and doing regular things, not getting up and down quickly or anything like that. I never have to steady myself, but I do purposely slow down a tad when I feel it.  Other things to mention that might help...   1) When I exercise and my heart rate gets above 180 for more than 5 minutes, I will develop intense pains that feel exactly like menstrual cramps that I get every month. I will have pain to the extreme that I cannot move or function for 10-20 minutes. When I have been to the ob/gyn they have said there is nothing wrong with me. Such exercise has not caused the above mentioned chest pains.  2) The only prescriptions I have been on in the last 10 years have been a couple rounds of antibiotics. No birth control or anything.  3) I have noticed occasional tingling of my big toe on my left foot for the last year.  4) I am 5'8\" and 155 lbs. I have never smoked, I rarely drink, and have never done drugs. I am also a vegetarian. I have wondered about not getting enough iron, but other vitamins and minerals should be ok.  5) Around the same time that I developed the chest pains, I also seemed to develop a type of asthma. The house I was living in was right next to an interstate and I highly suspected mold in the house but was not in a position to find out for sure.  6) I am about average when it comes to how often I exercise (3 days a week, 1/2 - 1 hour)  Any input would be very appreciated. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: longterm left side chest pain, lightheadedness, female - 29",
    "content": "Hello -  The pain you describe (the chest pain, that is) doesn't sound at all like cardiac pain, which, along with a stable presentation for three years (no progression to further problems) makes it unlikely this is due to coronary artery disease. That said, it's well know women do tend, far more often than men, to present with atypical symptoms. Still, over such a long period of time and not exacerbated by exercise (which causes a whole different problem), it still seems unlikely this is due to coronary artery disease. However, the left chest pain you've been having should be investigated. One good possibility is mitral valve prolapse (MVP) which is extremely common and almost always benign (it's estimated 10-15 % of the general population has it and it is often referred to as a \"variant of normal\", but often people  with it also have a syndrome that frequently includes sharp, stabbing, non-specific but usually left-sided chest pain, near the breast). The lightheadedness and dizziness sounds a great deal like benign positional vertigo (BPV) especially since it can be aggravated by lying down, something that normally would relieve lightheadness (faintness), not aggravate it. Then again, you also complain of lightheadedness while performing ordinary upright activities. It doesn't slow you down (as actual faintness would), so it may just be vertigo also. This is easy to check in the doctor's office without any special tests, just a simple \"watch my finger move\" and \"close your eyes while standing with your feet together\" usually will expose BPV. The MVP, if that's what's causing the chest pain, can often be diagnosed by resting EKG, oscultation (listening to the heart via stethescope), and sometimes also an echocardiogram. While positive findings using this triad are the \"gold standard\" for MVP  diagnosis, it is often not found anyway, at least not the first time. It can be elusive. Other problems can, however, be ruled out via this same simple process. It might help ease your mind.  And at what age did your father suffer a heart attack? This is just a family history question, but it's important to know if he was relatively (or very) young when that happened.  As  for the abdominal pain, that sounds like probable muscle cramping. I'd suggest, regardless of the ultimate diagnosis of that, that you try to keep your exercising heart rate below 180, since that seems to be the threshold for bringing on this phenomenon. It's odd, but once heart problems have been ruled out it will likely leave you with few other explanations than abdominal muscle cramping.   As to the tingling in your left big toe, no relationship to any of the other things in question, but also extremely common, usually due to a nerve being compressed somewhere between the lower back and the toe itself. Often due to a postural problem, shoes (heels in particular) or Just One of Those Things.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: left ventricle enlargement ?",
    "content": "Hi there -  First, while the sensations you feel are real (and often \"normal\" or at least not dangerous), they can be caused or at least magnified by anxiety. This is no joke, no \"It's all in your head\" response, either. You feel these things. The paradox is many people are not as sensitized to them, and anxiety can actually cause stronger cardiac output, so these nominally normal sensations become very noticeable to many people who suffer from anxiety. Those who experience increased blood pressures because of anxiety are more likely to notice these things than some other anxious persons.   Anxiety was described early on as \"the unpleasant emotion.\" There's no question it's unpleasant. I'm not sure it's proper to even call it an emotion when it goes into overdrive due to a chemical imbalance or obsessive behavior (and somatic awareness -- noticing your body acting normally -- is an obsessive trait). At that point  it becomes a self-perpetuating problem. To feel anxious when there is something wrong is  normal. To feel anxious  when nothing is wrong is sometimes not normal. There are two excellent ways to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and even panic disorder,  which is a more dramatic and less predictable form or anxiety: the first is medication, and  there are several families of meds your doctor can try. Then there is cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps teach the patient how to manage out-of-control anxiety by recognizing the triggers that set it off. The two together are the best combination. You should discuss this possibility with your doctor.  Your left ventricle is of normal size and, just as importantly, is functioning properly. The left ventricular ejection fraction is the single most important measurement of the heart's functioning, and yours is excellent. Try to be happy about that; not everyone knows it.   As you learn to manage your anxious feelings the strange sensations will become less and less noticeable and  will slowly fade from your awareness.  Only your blood pressure may require medication to manage it, but only if controlling your anxiety problem doesn't allow it to go back down on its own.  This is a potential problem, but not a huge one, since the elevation is likely due to anxiety (a very common symptom).  I hope  this helps.  Please follow up with your doctor regarding possible ways of getting the anxiety problem under your control. Also, please follow up with us here as needed, especially if you have any additional  questions. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pinch in lower left arm and burps and discomfort",
    "content": "Hello -   Gastroesophogeal reflux disease (GERD) can cause all the symptoms you describe (including the pinching sensation in your left arm, although that could also be a separate issue), It often mimics cardiac symtoms as well, due to the fact that the same nerves serve the upper GI tract that serve the heart and other structures in the thorax. Since your doctor has found nothing remarkable on your EKG and you have responded well to the protonix, the greatest likelihood is that your problem is GERD and that it is being treated appropriately and successfully.  Since your doctor left open the possibility of an optional stress test, it may help to ease your mind if you can do this and rule out any possibility of heart problems. If this is a concern to you, then by all means have the stress test done. Then you can know with reasonable certainty what is going on and the reduction in anxiety over possible heart problems actually could help ease the GERD symptoms as well, since they can be aggravated by stress.  I hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "HELP! My husband is 75 yrs old and had open heart (QUAD DROUPLE) bypass surgery in july 2008. Since then he has problems with eating. Primary Dr put him on NEXIUM.  It did not help so DR precscribed metoclopramide @ bedtime  lopressorsimvastatin, zocor and ecotrin prescribed by heart surgeon.  He was on metoprolol  but was weaned off it this past week.  We went back to primary DR last week and was put on ADVAIR ( he has allergys as well) He cannot walk outside in the bitter cold air .he has burning sensations in neck/jaw/ears/throat. we are concerned it is more serious complications from heart bypass. Can you shed any light on whats going on? He is a very active 75 yr old and looks 60 ! He stays inside almost everyday because of his fear ofthese problems. I think he may have anxiety  on top of it all and refuses to take any more pills!  He could not eat thanksgiving dinner poor guy..he cooked it all ltoo!   Do we seek a gastro doctor now? Please help  Thank youin advance for any help. Diane\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Diane -  Most of what your husband is going through right now is pretty much par for the course post  coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. For some reason a lot of people find themselves suffering from GERD after the surgery, and sometimes  it resolves after a while, sometimes remains chronic. It may be due to injury of a nerve which controls the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) at least in some  cases. The Nexium might help over time, and the metoclopramide should  help as well, in the short run. Also, I note that all the new heart meds are directed to be take at bedtime, which would be fine except that this is a bunch of stuff lying in your husband's stomch, needing to be dissolved, right as he lays down to sleep, which could be aggravating the GERD quite a bit. It might be wise to adjust (over the course of a few days) the medication time to earlier in the  day (morning would be ideal) so that he's upright most of the time as the handful of pills is dissolving in his stomach.  He should also, of course,  avoid eating anything else close to bedtime, as this is a classic aggravator of GERD.   I'm curious about your husband having been weaned off metaprolol and then placed on Lopressor (which is just a brand of metaprolol). He should be on a beta blocker, I'm just curious what he's taking for sure right now.  No one with heart disease should be  taking walks in the bitter cold, as it does cause discomfort and  can also cause more serious problems. If he has to go out when it's very cold he should wear a scarf over his nose and mouth (don't worry if it makes him look like an old-time bank robber -- it will keep the air warm and help reduce that burning sensation from  the cold air as he breathes it).   The burning and pain in the neck/jaw/ears/throat can  be a perfectly normal reaction to exposure  to cold, but he's going to be more sensitive to that for a while. Also typical of post CABG patients is anxiety, depression, and, oddly, sometimes even a little bit of mania. Sometimes one will see all three in varying degrees. Anxiety is the most common, because the patient actually begins to feel more safe in the hospital setting after undergoing a pronounced physical trauma (and having one's chest cracked open and stuff done to the heart is traumatic!). Most adjust after a while, but it can  take some time, especially if the surgery is done in cold weather, as it makes the patient more reluctant to go outside and do things.   In short,  everything sounds  pretty normal so far. It's a lot to be concerned about, and one looks for things to go wrong and it can be hard to tell, especially when the patient is (naturally) anxious. GERD doesn't help,  and exposure to bitter cold air is really to be avoided as much as possible. Going to the car, etc., should (seriously) be done with something like the scarf over the nose and mouth to reduce exposure to  the cold. It should help a lot.   The emotional recovery from CABG is often a lot slower than the physical part, but they are both normal and can  take a while. Be patient and supportive and encourage your husband to get into a cardiac rehab program as soon as he can. Nothing will help his self-confidence more than that.\n\n",

He takes Simvastatin and metoplopramide at bedtime.  he was on metopolol since day one from the hospital but his primary DR made him wean off it dueto the complaints he made.....he was having problems eating and the burning.etc.  My husband is happy that it is the NORM and I feel better now. You cannot imagine what a relief to hear from you. We thought after 4 months he should feel MUCH better instead of the issues he is expieriencing.  Greatly apprieciated!! Thank you Diane\n\n",

    "title": "6 month chest pain...... and still going???????",
    "content": "Hey there! I am a 37 yr old white male about 5'91/2 and about 195 lbs. I have spent a good portion of my life quite active so my weight is decently distributed with substantial muscle tone. I have smoked for 20 years at about 15 cigarettes per day. About 6 months ago I started having some mild chest pain (never before had I experienced this). I consulted a family practitioner. He ordered an excercise stress test, and some blood work (CBC while fasting, urinalysis, cholesterol). Further, I asked for a CXR as well. Results were seemingly normal. There were no ischemic events from the stress test. As a matter of fact, the EKG was normal as well as the nuclear imaging results according to the Cardiologists reports. The length of the excercise was about 12 minutes at 6.0 mph with an incline of 18% before injection of the radionucleotide. The blood work was seemingly normal as well. The total cholesterol level was 203 with the HDL being 38 and the LDL being 144 (might have those numbers juxtaposed). The family practitioner was not concerned. The CXR was also negative. No abnormal findings. The FP palpated my chest for possible tenderness (costochondritis) with some tenderness associated. This was ultimately his diagnosis. More info, my blood pressure was 116/68 at first visit. It did spike to 118/88 at the second visit prior to the results but after talking to the FP and my worries kinda eased it did immediately drop to 116/76 within 15 minutes.  Let me just say, my anxiety level and stress level are probably at an all time high for me. Generally speaking, I'm a pretty easy going kinda guy. I am not on any kinda meds nor did they prescribe any. Although, as of last nite, I have started taking ibuprofen (4 x 250 mgs./day). My FP did tell me he did notice somewhat of a low platelet count during the blood work. My father's side of the family seems to be a bit hypertensive. My paternal grandfather died of a brain aneurysm, my uncle has had cardiac issues but is probably due to his compulsive drinking and smoking. And my father, who is a urologic surgeon and who concurs with the FP, has been a bit hypertensive. My mother's side of the family has a history of colo-rectal cancer as both my grandmother and aunt passed from this. My maternal grandfather died of emphysema after many years of chain smoking.  NOTE:[/b]  I had to stop the ibuprofen because I had a single episode of blood in the stool and has never reoccurred after the discontinuation of the ibuprofen. My symptoms began about 3 weeks before my marriage in early July after a short bout with a cold type sickness. I was having chest pains in the middle of my chest however they only occurred when I twisted my torso in either direction (ex. like turning towards the backseat while driving etc..). It has gotten somewhat worse since then. Now, it doesn't require any upper body torso movements as it happens spontaneously with/ or without excercise. And the pains are no longer focused on the middle of my chest.  Fast forward a couple of months later to present and I'm still having chest pains that kinda migrate into the center of my back and both shoulder blades. It feels musculoskeletal but I can't say so for sure. Suffice it to say, it makes me VERY UNEASY. And probably causes higher levels of anxiety and stress. All I can say is that I've had a nuclear stress test done, blood work, CXR, and then a CT scan of the chest with contrast (done in early September) and they've all come back normal and negative. Stretching of my upper torso from side to side or touching my toes seems to alleviate the discomfort but it returns a few minutes later. The raising of my shoulders can sometimes mimic the pain.  I gotta tell you it' driving me a lil crazy. I've also recently noticed that when I take a deep breath or yawn, I sometimes may get a lil discomfort in the middle of my chest. Due to the blood in the urine, I have a colonoscopy scheduled for the middle of this month.  And I'm thinking about seeing a Cardiologist.  Any thoughts on any necessary tests or areas I should focus on??  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  You've done all the appropriate things to rule out cardiological causes of the chest pains, and from your description of them they do sound distinctly musculoskeletal in nature. The original diagnosis of costochondritis may have been right or at least close, the only qualifier to that being the fact that your pain now can migrate to the back, which may implicate a thoracic spine problem instead of costochondral inflammation.   While a cardiology consult would probably help put your mind at ease, you've pretty much had all the tests you'd have with  that already, with the  possible exception of an echocardiogram, and it looks like you're clear of any heart problems. Your pains were originally duplicable by upper body twisting, which would confirm musculoskeletal problems, and now they can sometimes be relieved by upper body stretching, which is an inverse confirmation of the same thing.   I  think that while the cardiologist may help ease your mind some, you'll be best served by having an orthopedic consult next or at least after the cardio workup.  You definitely don't sound like a heart disease candidate based on your supplied information. I hope this helps and please keep us updated as to how things go.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for your prompt response.  It's been almost a month since I last posted and your response.  Since then the pains have continued encompassing bilateral chest pains, generally speaking middle to upper back pains and now I can feel a lil bit of left jaw pain just under the palate.  It seems to come and go and never for long or never intense.  It feels almost like a cramp on the left side of my jaw.  I also feel somewhat light-headed and kinda fuzzy eyed on occasion, it also comes and goes.  I've recently had an endoscopy and colonoscopy done to rule out GI problems and the results returned pretty normal as per the gastroenterologist.  I am scheduled for an Echocardiogram on Friday the 5th of December.  In my first meeting with the cardiologist, after he went throught my H&P and going over my symptoms, he said that he didn't think it was cardiac related but suggested to maybe schedule an echo.  By the way, at the time, a resting EKG was performed and came up normal as well.  I'm becoming truly frustrated.  Any ideas???  What kind of information will an echocardiogram provide??  Thank you so much!\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for your prompt reply before.  It is now December 2, 2008 and the chest discomfort with radiating pain to the center of my back persists.  I have also experienced some left jaw discomfort just underneath my chin along the jaw line.  It usually doesn't last long maybe a few minutes and kinda feels like cramping.  I do experience on occasion some left arm discomfort and have been experiencing some bouts of lightheadedness or kinda like fuzzyness in my head.  I've done further testing to look into some more possibilities.  I've visited the GI doctor and ahve had an endoscopy and colonoscopy performed, each of which were seemingly normal.  I must admit two small polyps were found and subsequently removed.  According to the GI doctor, there was no esophagitis.  The GI doctor has recommended that I go on Aciphex 200 mgs. 2X/day and also that I take a Zantac at night after dinner.  Also, I am taking a GAS-X pill 2x/day. (Note:  The lightheadedness and the 1 time bout of nausea which lasted for about 1 minute didn't start til yesterday.)    Further, I did go see a cardiologist.  Resting EKG at the office demonstrated normal sinus rhythm.  According to the cardiologist after reviewing test results and listening to my H&P, my problems didn't seem to be cardiac in nature.  Although he did suggest that I may wanna do an echocardiogram just in case.  Do you have any suggestions????  Cuz I am at a loss here and completely frustrated!!!  I appreciate your help.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  While it is less than likely that you have a structural heart defect, one can have more than one thing going on at the same time, and sometimes certain structural heart defects (of the sort that can easily be visualized via echocardiogram) can announce themselves with these sorts of symptoms. If it weren't for the lightheadedness in addition to the pains I might not be quite so interested to see an echo performed, but given the particular set of symptoms, I think it extremely wise to rule out any sort of cardiomyopathy, especially any thickening of the free wall of the left ventricle, or thickening of the septum that reduces the volume of the left ventricle, which are two of the more common sorts of structural problems that might produce these symptoms. If this comes out negative then all to the good, and you (or at least I) can probably relax a bit, but the most serious possibilities should be ruled out (or in) first. I'm glad your doctor, while skeptical, is still willing to do the echo. I look forward to hearing about those results. Please update us when you've had that done. If there is any significant structural abnormality on the inside of the heart (including any valve problems) this will show them up.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While self-administered EKGs do have their limitations as a rule (for a number of reasons), the finding of \"possible lateral ischemia\", while a very common non-specific finding by the EKG machine's own database, does warrant a \"real\", supine EKG administered by another party. This should be done anyway, pre-surgery. The fact that you saw some .1 mm depression in some leads could be artifact due to you having been upright, having done the tracing yourself, etc., or it could be due to a chronic or recurrent low K levels. A BMP draw and proper EKG should clarifiy this for you, and, as I've said above, should be done anyway, prior to the myomectomy. The HGB is a little high, and that also warrants followup, but shouldn't serve as a contraindication  to surgery.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck and please do follow up with us.\n\n",

    "content": "Age: 18 Weight: 165 Height: 5'9\" History: Skin cancer (Mother) Hay fever (Father) Current Medications: Loestrin 24e (1 pill a day, not sure about dosage)  I've been having sharp chest pains off and on for over a year now. They're fairly infrequent, maybe once or twice a month, but I'm concerned. I read the instructions for my birth control, which I've been on for almost a year, and it says that sharp chest pain is a symptom of worry as it can mean a blood clot in the lungs.   The pain is specifically something like a bad chest stitch, but I'm not exercising when I get them. I'm unable to expand my lungs, the pain is so bad, the episodes last for about 10 minutes at a time, and I have to keep myself breathing to ease more and more air into my lungs until they're normal again. Last night especially, I was woken up with how intense the pain was, and I felt like my right shoulder had the same thing my lung had. Also, it's always the same lung.  I know clots are dangerous. I live an active lifestyle, going to college full time, working, and running my sister various places; however, I don't have any serious exercise habits - I walk my dog every day, I stretch in the mornings and do small ab and inner thigh workouts.   I'd like to know what this is in case I need to go see a doctor immediately. My boyfriend's mother died of a clot to her heart, and I'm terrified the same will happen to me.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sharp chest pain on right side - 18 year old female",
    "content": "Hi there -  What you describe sounds a lot like pleuritic pain, which means an irritation of the pleura, the lining between the lungs and the chest wall. This can be extremely painful, often radiates to the shoulder, and can occur on either side (right-sided chest pain is rarely cardiac related but certainly can involve a lung). There is a certain, discrete risk of pulmonary embolism that comes with use of birth control pills, so your concern is not unreasonable. What  I wonder at is the fact that this pain  has been going on, off and on, for over a year. While  it's not out of the question that you could have (or have had) a pulmonary embolism (PE), it seems fairly unlikely, simply because once the clot has reached a lung, the progress to severe distress is usually fairly rapid and certainly would have forced you to the ER in less than a few days' time, tops. However, since by using Loestrin you do actually assume a certain minor risk factor for PE, it might be wise to find out just what's causing the pleuritic pain. Usually (but not always) a PE is preceded by a clot in a deep leg vein, which causes symptoms of its own, most often severe enough to bring attention to it before the clot has a chance to break loose and make its way to a lung or elsewhere. If you've had any sort of similar experience prior to any of this chest pain then there's a somewhat  greater chance you may have had a DVT, but as active as you are it seems extremely unlikely, unless, of course, you have a rare clotting factor disorder.   I think the smart starting place would be to simply be to a) see if the  chest pain responds to a simple anti-inflammatory pain medication like  Advil or Aleve. If it does, then it's probably a chest wall issue and not at all serious. If that doesn't do the trick,  then plan b) should be to be seen by an MD, who can assess your symptoms and perhaps do  a few simple tests to determine if you have some chronic pleuritic inflammation and rule out any signs of a possible PE (which, again, is still very unlikely). This would be mostly for the purpose of putting your mind at ease about the possibility, but would have the side benefit of having covered the base and of course if there were, by some remote chance, an old clot (which by now would have calcified) you could at least know about it for future reference and prevention of any such future incidents.  While I seriously doubt  the exam would show up even an old clot, you're having pain which is never any fun, and if the over-the-counter pain medication doesn't help, then it would be worthwhile to be seen if only to find a way to get rid of the pain once and for all.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as necessary.\n\n",

    "title": "Chest Pain Incident but normal EKG and labs",
    "content": "I had an incident  2 weeks ago with chest discomfort/pressure/tightness and had some occasional nausea/dizziness.  On the 1st day, the feeling lasted all day until I went to bed.  It seemed to stop during sleep and for about an hour when I got up.  Then it started again.  At the end of the 2nd day, I went to a medical aid unit.  They did an EKG, which was normal but referred me to the ER.  The ER did another EKG along with one set of blood tests and an x-ray.  All were normal and they discharged me instructing me to get a stress test that week.  For various beaurocratic reasons I have not gotten it yet but will next week.  The symptoms have mostly subsided.  I am 44, overweight (BMI = 33); no history of CAD but do take meds for reflux.  I don't smoke or drink.    Do the tests I had in the ER rule out a heart attack?  If the stress test (nuclear imaging with treadmill) is normal will that rule it out?  Did I make a mistake by not insisting on the stress test immediately?  Thanks in advance,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The ER tests rule out an incipient myocardial infarction (heart attack, MI), but do not rule out heart disease, which can, in turn, eventually causes a heart attack. A stress test, especially if done with a nuclear scan, can rule out  heart disease with roughly 95 per cent accuracy. If the test were to come out positive for coronary heart disease (CAD) there is a slightly greater chance for a false positive, which only increases the need, in those cases, for an angiogram to determine precisely if there is any significant blockage.  Given your episode, it is quite appropriate that you have the stress test. If there had been a more suggestive finding with the EKG and/or blood work, ER staff would have recommended a more urgent stress test. You were stable at the time, so that's not an unusual approach, to just refer for stress test, since there is sufficient question as to whether or not you have any significant heart disease. I do hope you'll have the test soon, however, just to be certain what is going on. It may well be GI related, and that would be fine, but you do need to know what's up.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "22 Year Old Male/Panic attack or Heart Attact?",
    "content": "I apologize for the length of this post, however there is a heart related question, I just want to state the facts in which I think are important and have led to my \"problem\":  I am a 22 year old male.  I was extremely obese as a teen.. reaching the weight of 277 lbs at 6' 1\" at the age of 15/16.  As of today I weigh 168 lbs.  Although my weight sounds encouraging, it concerns me how the weight was lost.    I'm not sure if I have been malnourished, undiagnosed diabetes, or anorexic as losing weight has been a goal for the past few years.  I weighed 207 lbs this April and 7 months later I have lost 40 lbs.  I must say I have made a huge change in my food choices (no fast food, rarely eat fried foods, no soda [only water, beer, and coffee], pretty much grilled chicken, salads, slimfasts, and Kashi cereal are my main diet.  HOWEVER, 40 lbs lost just from eating properly doesn't sound right to me?  I didn't workout at all, although I did make a career change (from sitting at a desk in a call center for 4 years; to serving tables walking at least a couple of miles per shift) which did increase my activity level a lot.  So far, I was very obese (very bad food choices), have lost a dramatic amount of weight in a short period of time (from lack of eating because of my odd schedule; although the food I do eat is of good nature)  Now to the heart related question:  My lifestyle includes: -smoking cigarettes since I was 16 (avg 3/4 a pack a day) -smoking marijuana since I was 16 (daily, sometimes once, sometimes 10 times daily) -chewing tobacco randomly throughout the same time -drinking alcohol regularly, but no abusing it (as of late, about once or twice every two weeks)  About two months ago I was at home and went outside to smoke a blunt of marijuana.. I came inside and about 10 minutes passed, when I noticed (more than ever) my heart rate was incredibly fast and hard.  I immediately looked online for what a \"normal\" heart rate should be.  I noticed mine was far beyond what was listed.  I immediately fell into a panic attack, thinking I was about to die, that lasted for serveral hours with full blown symptoms, until I finally was able to fall asleep when the sun came up.  (I thought it was a heart attack at the time, but after researching online, I am trying to convince myself that it was indeed a panic attack)  The next day, I was weak, tired, seeing stars (which all of these symptoms, come to think of it, have happened irregularly over the past several months).  The day after that, I tried to smoke marijuana again, in the morning, just to see if it would happen again, and it did.  I had another panic attack.  That whole day I felt terrible.  Left work, came home, and just laid down all day.  I was extremely achy over my entire body, had a fever, and thought I was getting the flu, but those symptoms were no longer the next morning.  So it concerned me, because it wasn't the flu?  I have been suffering from depersonalization and anxiety ever since this, (2 months now) and over the same period of time, I have been experiencing random, sharp (not too intense) pains in my chest.     They occur about 2 inches to the left of my left nipple, about an inch down, and under my ribcage.  There isn't any particular time that I could say it does happen, except a lot when I try to go to sleep at night, but I believe that's when my anxiety kicks in because I always think I am about to die, thinking that 2 months ago, it was in fact a heart attack.  But my anxiety shouldn't trigger a sharp pain in my chest, right?   A lot of the time these pains occur, simultaneously, I feel a sharp pain in either my spleen or liver.. not sure which one, but I've tried to match it up with an organ diagram from the internet.  I try to focus on these pains more, because I feel like they are less important than my chest pains (which I believe are heart related) and helps me feel comforted thinking it's something other than my heart. I experience light-headiness, a feeling that I'm \"not all there\", and depressed.   So,  Did I indeed have a heart attack, which has weakened my heart?  But then, would I have been able to go right back to work like I did, and play basketball like I do?  According to research it takes a couple of months to recover.  Do I have clogged arteries because of my previous life style and food choices?  Does it sound like I have diabetes because of my possible liver pains and weight loss?   I've read about Precordial Catch Syndrome (PCS), could it be that?  Could ALL of this be a cause of malnourishment in which I am lacking either some sort of blood cells, or vitamins and minerals?  I know this a very complex situation, so where do I start?  I have not seen any type of doctor, physician, cardiologist, or psychiatrist due to the fact that I have no money, nor does my job offer health insurance.  If I were to see some sort of expert, who should I see first?  The last time I went to a doctor of any sort has to have been over 6-7 years ago when I had mono.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 22 Year Old Male/Panic attack or Heart Attact?",
    "content": "Hi there -  The lengthy but intelligent and well-written, thorough explanation of your concerns is greatly appreciated. Hopefully the somewhat shorter answer will help you feel better.  You describe a number of things which deservedly have gotten your attention, but which are, for the most part, quite benign. However, anxiety-related symptoms, in particular, can be lifestyle threatening only,  which is bad enough.   First, your weight loss. You are wise and well-informed to understand the importance of rapid weight loss. However, in your case, what you describe is not especially abnormal, but is, rather, something that is easier to achieve at your relatively young age than it would be later on (and so, I must say, good job!). It is odd, but in my experience 40 pounds seems to be a watermark for intentional weight loss over a period  of 4-12 months. Not 34, not 43, but 40. The number comes up with remarkable frequency. I have no scientific rationale for this, but it has been my experience that young people who have become obese or at least significantly overweight often do, by diet alone, manage to lose 40 lbs. Over the course of seven months this is, of course, an average of a little more than  six per month, and admirable and healthy rate of loss. Take it for what it is and be  glad you've done it early when it was still possible.   Now then: there are, as I'm  sure you realize, some more lifestyle changes in order, the first of which would be the elimination of tobacco use. This is the single greatest risk factor you carry, and since you've lost the weight it may be the only remaining risk factor, but it is a significant one. I'm sure you know the story on this,  so I'm not going to launch into a lecture. Do your best to lose the tobacco dependency. That's all.  The drinking sounds as though it's within reasonable limits. Only you can know this for certain, so be careful, but don't deprive yourself unless you know you have a problem. No one can be certain of this but you, so cultivating an awareness about the way you consume alcohol, as well as the reasons, will  help guide your use of this substance.   The marijuana experiements have shown  you that marijuana, while essentially benign (when used on occasion and not daily nor hourly) can sometimes trigger panic attacks. I'm not entirely certain why this happens, but since the THC does alter one's consciousness, I suppose \"playing  with the brain\" can result in unwanted and unpleasant reactions as well as pleasant ones. If it doesn't agree with you, and/or if the episodes begin to happen without marijuana use, you'll have to weigh the pleasure against the pain. Panic disorder, once it becomes established, can  be a real challenge to manage,  and it can definitely put a huge drag on one's enjoyment  of life and ability to function socially and professionally. So another thing for you to consider.  As for the pains in your chest,  what you describe do not sound, in any way, like what cardiac pains feel like.  On  the other hand, this sort of pain, in the location you describe, is classic for anxiety and panic disorder. While \"precordial catch\" is an attractive term, it has no essential meaning except to describe the sort of pains you describe. Its cause is unclear, but is related most often  to anxiety. It  is, therefore, verbal baggage unless used to describe innocent, benign left-sided chest pain.  Depersonalization, which some people don't seem to mind, can be a very disturbing phenomenon, and again,  is classic for chronic anxiety and is often a prodromal sign of a coming panic attack (or, as I personally believe may actually serve as a trigger, since many people have this phenomenon without panic, and actually seem to enjoy it, though I cannot for the  life of me see anything fun about it myself).   In  short, it sounds as though you are a healthy young man who has had some unhealthy habits early on, and are making excellent headway against them, but are also inclined toward anxiety and panic disorder, which may need to be addressed by a qualified professional if they begin to interfere with your normal life. Otherwise,  the biggest challenge facing you right now, since you've adopted a very healthy diet, are maintaining an excellent weight, and drink only moderately, is the elimination of tobacco.    I hope this all serves to ease your mind and helps to explain what's going on. If you have any further questions or concerns please do feel free to bring them to us here. Best of health to you, congratulations on the  (healthful) weight loss,  and best of luck with learning to manage the anxiety problem.\n\n",

Thank you again.  The response you wrote me is very encouraging.  I know I have a strong mind, which unfortunately has led me to my anxiety, however I am confident my strong mind will be able to overpower my anxiety.    This was the first time I've read my post since I wrote it, because it was waiting for approval from the webmaster, and I would like to add a correction or clarification.  The pain in my chest that I noted was \"2 inches to the left of my left nipple\", I should have stated that it is \"2 inches to MY left of my left nipple\" (your right if you were looking at me).  Is this how you interpreted it?  Thank you again, for your encouragement and quick response.  It meant a lot.\n\n",

    "content": "First all, let me state that I am a 25 year old female from Southeastern Georgia.  Since this past October, I have been experiencing extreme burning sensations in my chest along with Tachycardia.  Scared of the possible outcome, I have not informed my PCP of the chest pain, I just wrote it off as either being a symptom of either my Fibromyalgia or the anxiety attacks (have not mentioned this to my doctor either)  I now have. On a good day my pulse is between 110 and 120, and on has been known at times to be over 120.  I was diagnosed with Lyme Disease in January of this year, after an entire year of being ill.  My Primary Care Physican for the last few months has noticed a weird rattling in my chest.  My doctor now has decided that he wants me to have a complete physical, labs, pap smear, etc.  Is it possible that Lyme Disease could have caused some damage to my heart?  I have not experienced any shortness of breath, just pain in my back and chest.  I have the following conditions as well:  Myoclonus, Hypermobility Syndrome, Degenerative Disc Disease, , Intractible Migraines, mild focal kyphosis of the cervical spine, mild loss of intervertebral disc signal intensity suggesting mild early degenerative disc desiccation, mild central canal stenosis secondary to mild annular bulging. I also have been diagnosed with osteopenia and scoliosis, Neuropathy.  Medications include: Provigil 200 mg, Naproxen 2 500 mg tablets, Nortriptyline 3 25 mg caplets, Zanaflex 8 3 mg tablets, Lasix 60 mg, Potassium, Compazine, Phenergan, Corgard and Tranxene.    Symptoms include burning pain in muscles, electrical like sensations, Headaches, extreme fatigue, arthritis, difficulty concentrating, stiffness\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  First of all, yes, Lyme disease can, potentially, cause heart problems, and that is one good reason to begin to trust your healthcare provider to care for your problems. While this is probably not what has happened it is possible. The pain you describe sounds like nerve pain which would be consistent with peripheral neuropathy, and is probably not related to the elevated heart rate.   Overall, given the broad scope of orthopedic problems and other related nerve issues, it sounds as though you may also have Ehlers-Danlos disease, Type 3, which also can potentially cause some less serious heart problems.   I think most of your new symptoms are likely due to Lyme disease, which must be treated aggressively, but some of them may be due to what would appear to be connective tissue disease, which can occasionally throw a new symptom into the mix just to make things more confusing.   But first you must be willing to trust your doctor and understand that fear of a positive finding won't help make that problem get better; only by telling your doctor exactly what is troubling you can you hope to feel better and stay healthy.   I hope this is helpful and please do follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again and you're very welcome -  A couple types of E-D are certainly marked by hypermobility syndrome as well as degenerative connective tissue problems, usually in the joints and spinal column. So it seems something that should be ruled in or out, if only to simplify the management and avoid confusion.   If you are most comfortable with your PCP there's no reason why he couldn't function as your \"quarterback\" doctor to coordinate care with the others who you see. It may even be possible to reduce the number of them eventually.   There are often combinations of types of E-D and of other connective tissue diseases as well. It's not unusual for them to overlap. Knowing what's going on more specifically could really help the management of your symptoms and make you feel less like a patient and more like someone who simply has a somewhat different sort of physical makeup.   Best of luck to you. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again -  The diagnosis of E-D is done in two parts: first, the signs and symptoms part, in which each type of the disease is distinguised by certain signs, symptoms and abnormalities manifested in a given patient. This allows classification and projection of the prognosis (which, with the exception of Type IV, vascular, is generally good, although with certain sometimes chronic problems that are not life-threatening. The second part is laboratory testing for specific genetic and collagen abnormalities: the vascular form of E-D (type IV) and for arthrochalasia (E-D type VIIA and VIIB) and dermatosparaxis (type VIIC), biochemical studies can detect alterations in collagen molecules in cultured skin fibroblasts. Molecular testing for Types IV and VII is also available. The rest are diagnosed specifically based upon the physical findings as above.   The determination of what type, the genetic origin, and the likelihood of passing on a non-working pair of genes or just one gene, is all very complex and can and should be included in genetic counseling of anyone who is diagnosed with a type of this disease.   The type of specialist most commonly involved in the long-term management of E-D is a rheumatologist, although dermatolagists sometimes become involved and someone specializing in genetic defects is often of great usefulness as well.   I hope this answers your question.\n\n",

    "content": "On Saturday I noticed these bruises on my upper and lower legs, they are about 2 cm and painless.  They are either purple or red in color, and appear in clusters (majority of which are on the backside).  Like I stated in my earlier post I have a burning pain in my chest as well as tachycardia (normally above 115).  Since my last post, I have been diagnosed with Intractable Migraines, and prescribed Maxalt 10 mg tablets as needed on top of the Nortriptyline 75 mg.  He also prescribed the Medrol Dos pak for the times when they come on as clusters, which is all of the time.  In the last month and a half, I have experienced a constant sore throat, this appeared shortly after the last bacterial infection I had.  (I am an Educator in a Kindergarten class.  My body is highly succeptable to disease.  Last Sunday (Nov 1) I lost my voice and could barely speak over a whisper.  This lasted for 8 days despite the use of Azithromycin 500 mg times 6 days.  I have also noticed that my legs and ankles swell to the point where I can barely fit them in a sandal after infection, despite normal kidney function, what could cause this?  At my  last appointment, my Rheumatologist decided that testing for Lupus might be necessary since my UA and labwork were abnormal.  My current Dx(es) are Fibromyalgia, Hypermobility Syndrome, Myoclonus, Neuropathy, Cervical Spinal Stenosis, Early Mild Disc Degenerative Disease, Early Mild Disc Desiccation, Kyphosis, Scoliosis, Osteopenia, B-12/Iron Deficiency, Anemia, Intractable Migraines, Tension Headaches, Anxiety Disorder, Chronic Rhinitis, Displacement of Lumbar Intervetable Disc without Myelopathy, Neurasthenia, and Partial Epilepsy.   My current Rx(es) are  Naproxen (2 -- 500 mg tablets daily)  Corgard (1 \u2013 40 mg tablet daily)  Phenergan (1 \u2013 25 mg tablet every 4 hours as needed for nausea) Compazine (1 -- 10 mg daily for nausea associated with Migraines) Nortriptyline (3 \u2013 25 mg tablets at night ) Provigil (2 \u2013 200 mg tablet daily ) Zanaflex 8 \u2013 4 mg tablets daily)  Lasix (1 \u2013 40 mg tablet daily) Potassium (1 \u2013 10 meq tablet twice daily) Tranxene (1 \u2013 3.75 mg three times daily as needed for anxiety) Zyrtec (1 \u2013 10 mg tablet daily) Skelaxin (1 \u2013 800 mg tablet three times daily) Lortab (Hydrocodone /APAP) 1 (5 /500 mg) tablet every 4 hours as needed  Intramuscular B-12 Once Monthly  Maxalt (1 -- 10 mg tablet as needed) Medrol Dos pack -- (only used when my migraines begin coming as clusters -- has me on a maintenance dose with refills available at pharmacy)  Lortab 1 -- (5/500 mg tablet needed for pain)  I have also been prescribed a TENS unit by Empi, Pool Therapy and complete Physical Therapy.  I have also been diagnosed with a condition called Neurasthenia,what is this?  There is not much on this, I see though it is rarely used in modern medicine.  Thanks so much for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The bruising or pettechiae on your legs does warrant further study, but probably in terms of blood work. You are on enough medications that it's possible one or more (or some combination) is causing a slight bleeding or bruising tendency. There are, of course, other possible reasons as well, but it should be fairly easy to determine what's wrong, if not precisely what's causing this.  The leg swelling may be related to the bruising, or it may be due to certain meds as well, and one that can do this is steroids (in this case the Medrol Dosepak). You might ask about that as well as a possible connection with the appearance of the bruises.  The term \"neurasthenia\" is an antique word no longer used in medical circles, primarily because it was generally applied to people who were thought to be weak or tired because of emotional disorder -- in the \"all in your head\" sense. It was once also a catch-all term for what was probably chronic fatigue syndrome and other not-yet-recognized disorders for which there was no diagnostic criteria. While an emotional cause for weakness or fatigue is not beyond the realm of possibility, both the diagnosis and treatment of somatic stress disorders is no longer so simple as to be dismissed with a single word. The use of it is slightly disturbing in this day and age.   I hope this is all helpful to you. Best of luck. Follow up with us as needed, and do keep us updated when you learn anything new.\n\n",

    "title": "Palpitations, Dizziness, Blue Hands - 27 year old",
    "content": "Greetings,  In the past 5-6 years or so, I've about 4 episodes of symptoms that are somewhat troubling. Basically, I start to feel extrememly dizzy (vertigo) and notice strong heart palpitations. Each time this has happened I've been sitting down (in class, at work etc.) and it just comes on suddenly. On one occassion I happened to look at my my hand first and it was completely grey - looked like no blood circulation. It frightened my friend who was sitting next to me (and me too!).  The dizziness/palpiations last for a short time but then I feel quite awful - exhausted and shivering. In the days that follow I feel exhausted and have a heavy sort of feeling in my chest. After a few days, I feel back to normal.  I visited a clinic after one episode where my heart rate was found to be quite high (140+) and took a while to come down to normal. In the days that followed I had an ECG and blood tests but all came back normal. There was never any follow-up.  I am an active person with a healthy weight. Don't drink or smoke. There is a family history of high blood pressure and artherosclerosis.  This happened again last week and am not certain if its worth seeing a doctor about...it has only happened a few times over the years. But its now happened enough times that it is a bit concerning.   Any ideas on this would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Palpitations, Dizziness, Blue Hands - 27 year old",
    "content": "Hi there -  Although you describe \"vertigo\" as one of the symptoms that occur during these episodes, I wonder if that's what you meant. Vertigo, usually arising due to a disturbance in the inner ear, causes a sensation of spinning, or of the room spinning, rather like finding one's self in a small boat in rough waters unexpectedly. Lightheadedness would normally accompany a sudden (paroxysmal) tachycardic epsisode.  In any event, generally the symptoms collectively fit the broad description of most sorts of paroxysmal tachycardias, and it would be very useful to learn which sort you're experiencing (it's plain you have some sort, but apparently an EKG wasn't performed during the recent acute episode). A rate of 140 beats per minute with sudden onset and symptoms such as lightheadedness and blanching of the skin are consistent,  as I've already said, with any one of a number of sudden-onset tachyarrhythmias. A resting EKG should  be performed, followed by either a 24-hour Holter monitor or, preferably, a 30-day event monitor, to try and identify the type of tachyarrhythmia you're occasionally having. Most of these are relatively benign, although one  or two can be of concern, but any has the potential to cause a faint with consequent injury (such as striking one's head on a hard floor or piece of furniture), and even if that doesn't happen, it's a profoundly unpleasant feeling and can usually be managed medically.   I'd strongly suggest a workup via cardiac consult to try and determine which sort of arrhythmia you're experiencing, both to determine the degree of seriousness (if any) and how best to manage it with medication or even possibly radio frequency (RF) ablation.  Meanwhile, since you seem to be fortunate enough to feel this coming on, continue to be careful about staying close to the ground when it's going on, or to pull over if it happens when you're driving. In most cases these things are essentially benign, but you don't need to crack your head or lose consciousness at the wheel. These are the biggest risks usually associated with this sort of problem.  I hope this is of help to you. Please keep us updated, and follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been having daily chest pain that last through the day.  Sometimes it is worse than others.  I went to the ER after a couple of weeks and a day that seemed to be getting worse.  The EKG, blood work, and x-rays looked good.  They told me my heart looked good and I didn't have any risk factors but I could follow up with my doctor and have  stress test.  I haven't done this as I don't have insurance and spent a TON at the ER.  When I was in the ER, when the Blood Pressure cup would inflate, it caused the pain to intensify in my chest and shoulder area into the arm.    I am starting to feel a lot more pains the last couple of days.  I exercise early every morning but I cannot determine if it makes it worse or not or if it brings it on each day.  I recently lost 30 pounds and went from 180 to 150 where I have maintained for a couple of months.  My blood pressure is good.  It has always been on the low side and my ER visit showed it still low.    The pains I feel vary.  I sometimes feel pressure under the breast or just throbbing in the armpit, shoulder, arm and sometimes neck.  I also sometimes get similar pains on the right side. Once I had a shooting pain go down my are from my arm pit on the right side.  Sometimes I only notice the pains when I think about them and other times they force me to stop and take notice.    Even though my ER visit showed a healthy heart, might there still be a problem?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  From  your description of the pains, as well as the negative findings of the ER studies, it seems very unlikely you're having heart-related symptoms. Pain below the left breast, into the armpit and otherwise as you describe are rarely heart-related, and in fact may be due to GI or orthopedic (usually rib cartilage) problems. The right-sided pains you describe don't fit the profile of heart pains even remotely, as they are sharp and traveling in the wrong direction.  The  fact that the inflation of the blood pressure cuff triggered pain retrograde to toward the usual area of origin suggests a possible nerve compression problem.   Lacking risk factors and having had a good result in the workup in the ER, plus the highly atypical (for cardiac purposes) pains, I strongly suspect no heart involvement, but possible orthopedic/nerve-related pains. You might want to pursue this angle if the pains become excessively bothersome.   Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Maximum heart rate in exercise, age 61",
    "content": "Hello -  First, as to your maximum heart rate, yours does seem to be just a tad high, but of  course these things are not actually hard and fast rules, although we try to draw a line somewhere, Actually, using the standard formula, your maximum should now be 159, and of course you're just barely above that. However, the usual goal is 75-90% of maximum. Again, however, you're doing a high intensity program, and for one hour, so you're pretty athletic, and your resting rate demonstrates this, as you have typical \"runner's bradycardia\" or an unusually slow resting rate. This is actually quite normal for your fitness level.   It sounds as though all this is  close enough to right so that without any symptoms you are probably in excellent condition.  As for that \"extra click\", I would have to assume this referred to a click murmur, which is characteristic of mitral valve prolapse (MVP), which is an extremely common and generally very benign condition that is so prevalent among the general population that it is often considered a \"variant of normal.\" The only reason you're even aware of it is because you were told about the click, and this is done only because doctors have an obligation to note anything not strictly by-the-book-normal, even though MVP is controversial in  some circles as even being abnormal. It doesn't seem to be affecting you at all, so it can safely be ignored.   All in all you sound like someone who is remarkably fit and healthy, and that it runs in your family, which is another plus.  Hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you and keep up the good work!\n\n",

The pain in my back was bad enough that I did go to my family physician who xrayed my spine but did not find any abnormalities and also did a abd. sonogram that was normal.  He perscribed Moblic 7.5 mg for inflamation and it made the pain much better for one week.  It has been a little over a week now and it is better but it is begining to hurt again.  I have a very  bad family history of heart disease...both parents have had bypass surgery.. my father had his first heart attack at age 41 and my mother at age 69.  I am concerned that it may be my heart and the Moblic is just making the pain better.  My B/P has been elevated anywhere from 140/84 - 165/104 which is unsual for me but I have gained about 10 lbs recently (I weigh 150 now) so I think that is prob what caused my B/P to go up.  I do have the discomfort in my jaw/s without having the pain in my back.  Does this sound like something I would need to have checked again?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While the Mobic did  seem to ease the back pain for  a while, the associated neck and jaw pain along with your markedly positive family cardiac history, should be  a red flag to your doctor to explore and hopefully rule out any coincidental heart  problems that may be overlapping with what does seem to be an orthopedic back  problem. The trouble here is that there are often unfortunate overlaps of medical problems which sometimes represent strange and very serious coincidences -- that is, more than one thing can be going on and the symptoms become blurred or one masking the other.   You have several major risk factors for heart disease and you have some symptoms which could be suggestive of a problem in that area. You need to have this ruled out, despite the fact that the central issue -- the back  pain -- has grabbed your doctor's attention and possibly distracted from  a more thorough exam.   You may well have no heart problem at all, but given the risk factors and the symptoms, it's really quite important you have this checked.  If there's no problem, that's great. If there is one, you certainly need to know, because once heart disease becomes symptomatic, it definitely requires treatment.   I hope this helps. Best of luck to you, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

I have had (for about 5 years) periodic episodes of very sharp chest pains (typically lasting several minutes) always immediately followed by very sharp headaches on the frontal lobe. Typically, when the episodes happen they will come several times within one day. They may then repeat within a several day period and then cease. These episodes may appear every several months. During the episodes I have not been able to take any action that will relieve either the chest pain or headaches (this includes laying down, standing-up, deep-slow breathing, hands over my head, avoiding lit areas). These episodes always occur while sitting down on the couch or at the desk, and never follow or are during physical activity of any intensity.  I have no known chronic illnesses though have had asthmatic conditions as a child. My family, particularly males have a history of heart disease with only one male family member surviving past 50 and the remainder (12) all passing from either a single cardiac arrest or after chronic cardiac diseases.

    "content": "Hello Shaso -  While it is unlikely you're experiencing heart problems, it is not impossible, even at your pretty young age. I don't know what your family history is like in this regard, but even so, you are describing enough classic symptoms which could be heart-related that the very best strategy is to be seen urgently to have that ruled out. I wouldn't wait any longer and, in fact, symptoms such as you describe, in general, should be investigated much sooner. However, now is as good a time as any.   As I said before, heart-related illness is unlikely, statistically at least, but going by symptoms alone, what you describe warrants a prompt look by either your doctor (if that's feasible) or, preferably, at an ER or urgent care facility.   Please follow up with us here and keep us updated. Hopefully it is something innocent that will go away on its own, but without further information, that's not a risk I'd be willing to take. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Consistent Cramps on Left Side of Chest",
    "content": "For the last two months, approximately, I have been experiencing consistent cramps on the left side of my chest.  The cramps produce a sharp pain that occurs toward the center of the chest, and can span out toward my left shoulder.  I am a 35 year old male, 5 ft 7, 165 lbs, a light smoker (3-4 ultralight cigarettes daily), and a social drinker on the weekends.  I am not on any medication, have been tested with normal to slightly elevated blood pressure twice in the last year, and although I was diagnosed with childhood asthma, it has not bothered me in well over a decade.  Here's the curious part:  the cramp in my chest occurs consistently when I walk, especially in the heat.  Within twenty minutes of walking, a sharp chest pain appears that forces me to stop.  If I relax for a few minutes, it goes away and I can continue walking.  However, inevitabley, the cramp will reappear.  This perplexes me because I often ride a stationary bike for up to 45 minutes a session, usually three times a week, in a rigorous manner, and the cramp has never occurred while riding.  However, even a leisurely walk now will almost certainly produce it.  Sadly, I have given up walking to and from my office because of this problem.  As you can imagine, I am very frustrated.  I am in decent shape, I eat well, and yet I can hardly walk anymore before I cramp up.  I did have one panick attack approximately three months ago.  A doctor performed an EKG and told me my heart was fine.  A blood oxygen test was also administered, and the results were 'stellar'.  I have been under some stress this summer that is related to my work and a move to a new city, but I am beginning to feel like things are under control.  What's the problem and how can I stop the cramping??\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While it certainly seems your chest discomfort is non-cardiac (based on your normal resting EKG, ability to tolerate high-intensity exercise on a stationary bike, plus your age and body mass index or BMI), something is going on. It is not unusual for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in particular, to manifest as chest pain or discomfort during exercise. This is also often associated with asthma, and is even sometimes the cause of asthma.   The pain is described as \"sharp\", and is located on the left side. Cardiac pain is almost never described as sharp and is rarely localized on the left side. It definitely doesn't sound like cardiac pain given all the facts as presented. This is a good thing.  Even if not caused by GERD, there are other gastrointestinal causes of this sort of pain. There is no guarantee this is the locus of the problem, but it is one area that needs to be looked at closely. It  could also be a muscular-metabolic problem, such as the classic \"stitch in the side\" phenomenon, which often happens when running or walking, and involves the up-and-down movement of certain internal organs while walking or running, which produce referred pain up through the nerves of the diaphragm.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Consistent Cramps on Left Side of Chest",
    "content": "Hi Arthur -  This sort of pain, which can be duplicated by using the chest wall structure and muscles, is not cardiac in nature, but is usually one of three benign but annoying things: either a muscle pull (on the inside or outside of the chest wall), inflamed cartilage between the ribs (Tietz' syndrome), or pleurisy, an irritation of the membrane that lines the inside of the chest and surrounds the lungs to allow them smooth movement as they inflate and deflate. All three will usually, unless quite severe, respond to over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain meds such as ibuprofin (Advil, Motrin) or naproxyn (Aleve). If one of these doesn't relieve the pain, at least during the time the drug is on-board, then a doctor can prescribe something stronger to resolve the inflammation.   Once in a great while there can be a chest wall anomaly, such as a cracked, bruised or displaced rib (often from something as innocent as a hard sneeze), which may benefit from being taped for a while, but this would be something only a doctor could determine. Even then usually the most effective treatment is symptomatic -- something for the discomfort.  Cardiac pain doesn't manifest that way and can't be duplicated by breathing or movement.  I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am a 22 year old student who has a history of chest pain for around 10months now. No history in our family, and I am 5\"7 and 9 stone. Do not smoke, but do drink. The pain is dull in nature, slightly towards the left side of my chest and often radiates to the back and down my left arm.  The only thing that I know for sure brings it on is alcohol. But this only occurs the day after I have been drinking and not immediately after a few beers. I feel a 'dragging' sensation throughout the day, with occasional deep, dull aches. Exercise can bring it on, but not always. When I am lying down the pain seems worse. Noticed that along with chest pain, accompanies a scatter of petechiae. Around 10-20 on arms and abdomen. These always increase in number day after alcohol consumption.   I saw a cardiologist 3months ago, who did ECG, stress, echo and bloods. All normal, about from mild tachycardia during echo, probably due to excitement/nervousness. Doctor prescribed proton pump inhibitor and sent me on way. Said petechiae likely to be incidental finding as bloods were clear.  Have tried mixtures of different antacids and proton pump inhibitors with no avail. Spicy/big meals do not bring the pain on.  Cutting out all alcohol has improved the pain to a degree, but is still brought on at random intervals. Petechiae have however stayed.  Completely up the wall with this, is really having a massive effect on my life. Have researched hundreds of conditions on the internet. What would you advise doctor? I'm totally lost which path to go down, cardio, gastro or possibly even respiratory?   thanks in advance\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  OK, here's what we know so far: you suffer occasional dull left-sided chest pain, especially after drinking. The pain sometimes radiates to your arm or back. With the pain you've also noted some pettechiae on your arms and abdomen.  This has been  going on for 10 months. Now to deconstruct:  Ten months of chest  pain would, were it heart-related, have progressed most  likely to something that would have sent you to an emergency facility by now. Also, because of your age, you are far less likely to have developed vastly premature coronary artery disease. The pettechiae definitely sounds incidental, although it may be related to drinking.  It would help to know if there is any  family history  of heart disease.   The pain sounds, on balance, as though it is GI in origin, probably an alcohol-aggravated gastritis, and a prescription for a potent proton pump inhibiting drug is probably in order, as well as giving some consideration to removing the most obvious trigger for the discomfort, which is the drinking. It seems you may have a stomach condition which is irritated by alcohol, and cause-and-effect tells us you feel worse after you've been drinking. Even an experimental period of abstinence might be useful, at least to test the theory that this is the cause.  Oh, and spicy foods do not, necessarily, despite advertising and common beliefs, cause or worsen heartburn or gastritis.  You may need to have an endoscopic exam if this doesn't get better, but given your age, the circumstances described, etc., it really doesn't sound like a heart problem. That  said, gastrtitis (which can become a frank gastric ulcer) can be every bit as serious as a heart problem over time, and is nothing to leave to resolve on its own. Please follow up with a gastroenterologist about this.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please stay in touch here.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 40 year old male. I quit smoking 2 years ago (although I never smoked too much), drink beer ocassionally, do  not properly exercise but walk a lot and normal weight. I do not eat any vegetables and little fruits. My father died of stroke at 52. He had hypertension and arterosclerosys (blocked arteries). I have been experiencing anxiety symptoms on and off for a few years, due to many personal life issues. I had a full checkup done 2.5 years ago to analyse the symptoms and it concluded it was anxiety. I do not take any medications now, although at the time I was prescribed Celexa and it seemed to work (although maybe it was the placebo effect). The symptoms have lately become worse and I worry about heart problems and arterosclerosys due to my non-vegeterian diet. I have been experiencing an uncomfortable sensation breathing, like I cannot get enough oxygen and find myself needing to take long breaths. This sensation gets worse when I am outside, although some times it happens in the morning at home. It comes and goes. Often I also feel tightness in my chest. Additionally, I feel lightheaded and a little disoriented. Is it normal, even with anxiety, to feel all these symptoms and in such a recurring fashion? Many times is a feeling similar to that after having been running in the cold weather, where you are gasping for air and feel that light headedness associated with the cold. Also, if I eat a lot, it gets worse. Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Difficulty Breathing, Chest Tightness and Light Headedness",
    "content": "Hello -  First, given your history of anxiety as an established diagnosis, what you are describing is pretty classic for chronic generalized anxiety (GAD), which has a nasty habit of adapting, over time, and changing so that it seems something new is going on. This is not to say you couldn't have some new physical problem,  although your symptoms are both vague enough and consistent enough with GAD (more about that in a moment) to justify an educated guess that you've simply worked your way into a new stage of the anxiety problem, it has mutated once again, and now it's time to address this new stage of the problem.  Part  of addressing this would be to have a thorough physical exam,  just to rule out any possible physical causes of any of this, plus the fact that you do have a positive family history for premature cardio and cerebrovascular illness (your father). You, yourself, sound fairly healthy, however. Still, by all means do schedule a physical exam for baseline  purposes.  Now then,  at the time of the physical, you should mention to your doctor that you are having new anxiety symptoms. The most telling one is your breathing problem, which, while it could possibly signal new-onset asthma, probably is not that. Your description of the sensation of inability to draw a full, satisfying breath, the resulting lightheadedness, etc., strongly suggests the deep sighing so often  seen in both anxiety-plagued individuals as well as some with depression. What happens is the sighing starts out being an unconscious expression of being \"weighed down\" and when it is done, this throws off enough carbon dioxide (CO2, the gas which the brain uses to \"know\" when it's time to remind one to breathe) that the breathing impulse is stifled. It's of no harm whatsoever, but what then happens is the  subject becomes aware he should be breathing and feels he can't get it quite right. Actually it's just that the brain isn't sending the usual \"breathe now\" signal. While breathing is a voluntary action, it is also a very deep reflex, and we are very aware of the need for it, even if we've been doing it wrong.  So the CO2 balance gets thrown off, we feel unable to breathe properly, and  begin to consciously sigh to get that  satisfying \"full breath\" feeling. Only it doesn't seem  to work, because doing  this just throws off more CO2, tricking the brain even  further. Eventually what happens is called hyperventilation syndrome,which means, very simply, symptoms caused by overbreathing. Those symtpoms normally include lightheadedness (which only makes us more certain we  need to breathe even more),  numbness and tingling around the mouth or in the fingers, and sometimes a vague feeling  of mental disconnection. Consequently we assume there's something bad happening to our breathing or heart, and try to compensate by breathing more: a vicious cycle.   Eating makes it worse because, as a rule, we tend to swallow air when we eat (aerophagia), which makes it more difficult to draw a full breath anyway, because the swallowed air (classic \"gas\") is trapped in the stomach and presses up against the diaphragm (the muscle which we use to breathe), just making the sensation  all the more disturbing.  Often, once a person has had this explained, he then becomes more aware of what's happening and is able  to control it better -- particularly by deliberately relaxing when the difficult breathing sensation starts, by breathing more shallowly and through the  nose (which makes it more difficult to sigh), and sometimes he is then able to break  the cycle and recognize it in the future. If not, sometimes a new antianxiety medication is in order, or perhaps cognitive behavioral therapy,  which is a self-limited (as opposed to open-ended and sometimes seemingly endless \"talk\" therapy) special type of therapy which helps the patient to learn to manage the problem by becoming aware of how the symptoms are caused.  I hope this is helpful to you. Again, I do recommend a standard physical exam, but I believe you are in excellent health most likely, and I am all but convinced you're hyperventilating and mistaking it for a breathing \"problem\" when actually it is represenative of a too-good ability to breathe.  Best of luck to you. Please follow up with  us as needed.\n\n",

Constant chest pain, even if it is left-sided, especially radiating (in this case into the left armpit) is a slightly ambiguous finding normally, but given the risk factors plus the fact that diabetics don't always feel the full extent of normal pain, and women often present with heart problems atypically, this should  be your first order of business. Get this ruled out, preferably at an ER or acute care walk-in facility.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here and keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Stabbing Chestpain with slight physical activity",
    "content": "Hi there -  While the hydrocodone is potentially problematic, and poses (for your grandfather in particular) a serious  legal liability, since it is illegal to share prescription  drugs (especially schedule II opioids) with anyone else, it is unlikely to have caused any damage to your heart. If anything -- and the doses you've been taking shouldn't do  this -- it is more likely to cause liver injury if anything.   You're doing very well to cut back on the hydrocodone and hopefully you will be able to fully wean yourself from it shortly. The  Excedrine should not be taken \"like candy\",  but then, no medication should be taken except as prescribed (or instructed, if the are over-the-counter drugs). There are very good reasons for this. In  the case of Excedrine it could very well injure your stomach lining, which is a whole different area of concern. Even at directed doses this can happen in some people, which is why it's good to have chronic pain problems  monitored by a doctor,  who can decide it you might need to take something in addition to Excedrine (or Advil or Aleve, Motrin, etc.) to protect your stomach lining -- once you're off the hydrocodone, that is.   Again, the hydrocodone wouldn't injure your heart, although  it could injure your liver. The Excedrine could have (more likely) injured your stomach lining. Anything has potential limits and side effects, and again, the transfer of prescription drugs, especially schedule II drugs,  presents a potentially very serious legal problem. Assuming all those things will  not happen and you continue to wean off the hydrocodone, everything should be fine.  As for those stabbing chest pains with slight  physical actiivty,  that sort of pain is almost never associated with heart disease. Since it happens  with even slight activity, it is most likely either muscular or skeletal in origin, and you may have become more sensitive to this  discomfort (and other  sorts as well) due to the use and  then reduction of use of hydrocodone, which tends to mask normal sensations and discomforts as well as easing major pains.   Your pain doesn't sound heart related and will probably resolve on its own. However, if you have any further questions or concernes, please do follow up with us here. Good luck to you.\n\n",

It is almost like a gurgling sensation over my heart area. I want to add that it is also hard to breathe at times and I frequently have to take deep breaths which increase the pain. The pain isn't the same level, 1-10, at all times but it is worrysome and annoying. I am very worried because my family has a strong history for Thyroid conditions, Heart conditions, and Diabetes.   Thanks and please ask any questions if you have any for me!  Brian\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Brian,  What you're describing doesn't sound like any sort of classic coronary artery disease symptom, and very little like even structural heart disease. Of course, since I can't listen to  your heart, perform an EKG or otherwise check you over (and I'm not a doctor, but am a very good assessor of incoming patients), it's impossible to make an unqualified statement about this. Nevertheless, since this is a website dedicated to advising, referring, directing, etc., I can make a couple of educated guesses about the symptoms and you can act accordingly.   This sensation you describe is heard occasionally and can be caused by one of several things: for one, it can be a referred gastric sensation, one which actually is what it feels like, stomach \"gnawing\",  but referred up into the left chest. The stomach and this part of the chest share a number of nerves, and the stomach itself is physically quite near the heart, at least part of the time. This is the most likely explanation. However, it also could be due to a thyroid condition which can cause odd flushing sensations (hyperthyroidism, that is). Another frequent cause, oddly enough, is panic disorder (PD), and you just happen to suffer from this very frustrating problem. This  is the most likely culprit in your case. I'm sure a lot of things get written off to this by doctors who see you, simply because it's an easy connection  to make, and that's why I'm not willing to make that unqualified statement about your heart being fine. However, since I can only answer statistically here, statistically your likelihood of having heart problems that could cause this sort of symptom are almost nil, whereas it is quite likely caused by PD, and may even be related to the intake of the (quite necessary) thyroid replacement medication. At any rate, knowing it's not heart-related should be  helpful. I certainly hope so.   Now then,  if you have any further questions, please feel free to ask us here. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  For the last 4-5 weeks or so I've noticed a mystery pain near my crotch area (around my pubic hair), and I've always noticed it about 10-30 minutes after ejaculation.  After about 2-3 weeks, I started noticing it when I had to go to the bathroom (both urination and bowel movements) and shortly after a full urination.  This entire time, also, I've had a decreased appetite and have lost 2 or 3 pounds.  Also lately, I've noticed smaller stools (1 inch long, 1/2 inch wide) and not typical ones.  I went to my Doctor about a week ago, who checked for a hernia and didn't find anything, and indicated he thought I had constipation and suggested Colace for a period of one week.  I've noticed no difference in my \"strange feeling\" nor have I noticed any difference in my bowel movements either.  I know it may not be anything, but I know far too many things go unaided because you think it's nothing (and could be more serious).  I've had this for 4-5 weeks now, and I feel it quite often (again, shortly after ejaculation, when I have to go to the bathroom, and shortly after going to the bathroom).  I'm not sure what it could be, but the decreased appetite definitely isn't unwelcome (I was on Paxil for a year and a half, and still trying to get some weight off), but the \"strange feeling\" is something that worries me and I was hoping for a second opinion.  I may have missed something, but again that's why I'm not a Doctor.  I'd be willing to answer any questions that might help, and generously thank you for your time!\n\n",

    "content": "Given the location and evolution of the character of the discomfort, the noted weight loss and most especially the narrowed stools, I would strongly suggest you be seen by a gastroenterologist or at least insist your primary doctor understand your concern about this. He should have referred you to a GI specialist and/or a urologist (I think GI would be the more productive route given what you've described). At the very least an MRI of the involved area would be in order to rule out any sort of growth which could be causing pressure on both the urinary tract and lower bowel area.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please follow up as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the reply.  About a week or two after this posting the feeling went away, but then lately it has come back again (although from what I can tell a little less).  During that time I have had more frequent stools, although still not any bigger.  I am having less frequent stools again, and still very small.  Also the feeling is still coming back primarily 5-15 minutes after ejaculation as well on occasion only.  I went to my primary care doctor about 2 months ago, and he said I was constipated and suggested I take Colace.  It appeared to do nothing.  I don't want to go back to my primary care doctor again wasting his time, my time, or any more money for it to be nothing.  On the other side, too many things go unaided or unnoticed because of similar situations, so I'm stuck in a pickle as to what I should do.  However I think I should note that as of the time of this writing, the funny feeling isn't that much of a concern anymore (the feelings aren't as noticable or frequent), and I've been having nothing but small stools for the last 2 months.  So at this point, I feel like the small stools are more of the concern, but don't know how to exactly fix that.  Are there other medications I should try, or maybe a fiber regiment?  Thank you for your input and assistance!\n\n",

However, the presence of smaller stools -- or, for that matter, any change in the usual stool appearance, but especially narrowing or smaller-sized stools -- is always a good reason to get it checked out, as this frequently can signify a narrowing of or growth inside the last length of the colon, and that's not something to ever ignore. If it turns out to be a nothing, great. If not, it needs to be addressed, and the sooner the better.  Please stay in touch and let us know how this all unfolds.\n\n",

To be honest, now I feel like I'm making up things and just end up scaring myself, but I know that's not something to ignore either.  So is there any way those two things can be related, by that I mean the smaller stools and the unusual growth on my left testicle?  But after discovering this (what I feel MAY be an) abnormality, I'm making an appointment for towards the end of the month.  However in the meantime, based on what you have said, is there anything I can do myself to \"cleanse\" my colon in an attempt to fix the narrowing?

I'm very glad you've made an appointment to have this looked into, and the new discovery you've made can be evaluated at that time too, especially its relevance to the small stools issue.  While I understand your desire to do anything you can in the interim to help resolve the problem, it's probably best to hold off on tryinig anything like a \"cleansing\" of the colon, as this is more likely to irritate the problem than remove it. Besides, if this results in referral for a colonoscopy, you'll have to do something along those lines anyway in preparation for that procedure.   Let us know how things go, by all means. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Given the negative findings of all the appropriate exams to rule out anything serious, I think your symptoms, while quite real, are unlikely to be anything worrisome. Since you've recently given birth, things can be a little bit moved around inside, and what you're probably feeling is a referred discomfort related to some sort of irritation of your diaphragm on the affected side. Sometimes the spleenic (left-sided) flexure of the colon can become irritable or allow gas to become trapped, referring this same sensation  up to the left chest and even into the left armpit or lower left neck. It's not  serious but can be awfully annoying.  While  everything  would seem to in perfectly good order, I would be remiss if I didn't add that of course, if anything changes, if the sensation becomes more severe or new, related symptoms develop,  that you should, of course, advise your doctor at once. However, I don't expect this to happen. It would seen you're in excellent shape and just experiencing some of the little anatomical annoyances that sometimes follow pregnancy and delivery.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

ONLY when I jog or run, I experience a very sharp pain in my center, upper chest a few inches below the bottom of my neck. I have had this problem since childhood. In high school, I was in prime shape and played soccer, but had very poor endurance comparatively. Even in prime shape, I could barely run a mile without being extremely out of breath. I would have to take rests because of the pain. I had an EKG done, and it showed nothing.   The problem does not happen while doing cardio on an elliptical machine or playing sports such as raquetball. It only happens when I run, which now prevents me from running. I assume I have a small lung capacity, but what would cause the extreme pain?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 24yr, sharp pain (upper center) only when running",
    "content": "Hi there-   Given that you  tolerate stationary aerobic exercise well, it would seem this pain is probably due to some anatomical anomaly. It probably isn't heart-related, and there are ways to make certain of this. For instance, if you can press on the area with two fingers and find this elicits pain or tenderness, then you probably have some chronic inflammation of connective tissue in the area. However, since you've had this problem all your life, this probably isn't the case.   Now then: pain that is highly localized and is described as \"sharp\" is rarely heart-related. In your case, however, you'd want to find out just what causes this pain, and a chest x-ray and possibly an echocardiogram wouldn't be too much to ask. If these both turn out normal, then you may be experiencing some sort of gastroesophageal reflux-related problem. The pain clearly is related to the up-and-down movement involved in running (the bouncing, which is causing something to hurt). This is probably not serious, but some obscure conditions should be ruled out or at least found out. Once you know nothing is out of place (and I am thinking perhaps a skeletal abnormality or perhaps reflux causing esophageal spasm during the act of running), you can either relax about it or treat it as appropriate.   I think you either have an anatomical abnormality (which may be acceptable or may benefit from correction) or are having upper GI problems aggravated, in either case by the bouncing motion of running/jogging. If your heart were abnormal in some way, you'd very likely experience symptoms even during stationary aerobic workouts.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this, and please keep us updated, especially as to what you may learn from an exam targeting this symptom.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It seems as though the test uncovered a defect probably present since (or before) birth. Patent ductus is one defect often seen in a trio of defects known as tetralogy of fallot, but since there is \"no significant ASD\" (ASD: atrial septal defect, or hole between the left and right atria or upper chambers of the heart), then you probably don't have the tetralogy, just a mild ateriovenous malformation or fistula, an abonormal blood vessel connecting the heart and pulmonary vein (as a rule) which can cause some degree of loss of oxygenated blood. From the report you quote, it doesn't sound as though it would be enough to account for your symptoms, especially since at your age your heart and related anatomy has probably remodeled itself to accomodate the small abnormality. This sort of remodeling is often seen even in gross congenital heart defects, and while fairly vague midlife symptoms sometimes develop, the problems are usually well-tolerated by that time and are compatable with a normal lifespan.   I hope this is helfpful to you. It would seem you have a relatively minor defect. Your symptoms  are probably more related to the diagnosis of CFS than to the shunt. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Welcome to the club. We all have premature heartbeats from time to time, but many of us aren't aware of them, and then one day -- there they are. It's unclear why they become perceptable suddenly, but that's almost certainly what you're feeling. Something momentarily irritates the heart muscle (which is sensitive anyway, and doesn't like to be \"touched\" internally). So something (caffeine, nicotine, fatigue, adrenaline, gas -- yes, gas -- etc.), makes a small area of heart muscle annoyed, and this triggers a premature beat. What happens next, in a normal heart, is a slight pause, so that the overall rhythm stays regular. It's like when a drummer misses a beat and, instead of sending the whole band off on  a diffferent tempo,  he waits a split second, then  picks up the orignal rhythm. This is actually a normal,  good and even healthy thing, but when felt by a person, it can be disturbing. However,  it's really common and normal. And yes, gas can definitely cause these little \"blips\", as can digestion itself. Exercise generally makes these things go away, but they can start up at rest, especially after eating, falling asleep, or when there's gas crowding the  heart.   I hope this answers your question and eases your mind. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I am a 28 y/o female. I'm 5'6 and weight 290 lbs. I'm a heavy smoker and drinker, and a not so great eater. I know it sounds bad but I'm trying to be honest and trust me, I'm trying to change! I have been diagnosed with panic disorder, generalized anxiety, depression, and ptsd. I have been experiencing chest pains for years now that all the doctors say are related to anxiety. But lately my symptoms have changed.  I have cut down on my drinking because I know it does not help my anxiety and I'm just self-medicating. I've begun to attempt to eat better as well but I am still smoking. It's frustrating knowing something is horrible for you and not having the motivation to change your habits.  Anyway, I am on effexor xr 225mg daily, atenolol 25mg daily (new because for the past few day my bp was up, around 150/95), klonipin 1/2mg twice a day, and prilosec 40mg a day. But lately my symptoms have changed. I have been consistently nauseous 3-4 hours a day and get intermittent chest pains and strange aches, which I attribute to anxiety but lately I've been getting chest pains and dizziness with exertion but not consistently. During these periods my chest on the left side and left arm hurts. I get really hot and sweaty and feel short of breath. I also can feel some pain in my neck and jaw. When this happens I take a klonipin and it pretty much subsides but the tightness is still there in my shoulders and chest.I have had numerous ekg's and an echo all which came back normal. I am just wondering if I need further testing or not. My doctor seems to think that this is all related to my anxiety but lately I've been wondering just because the symptoms seem more severe and different than before. I am also going for a med check with a psychiatrist later this week. So, does this sound cardiac related to you or consistent with anxiety? If I need more testing, what would you suggest? Any insight would be helpful. Oh, my father, whom has been an alcoholic for years had bypass surgery around 50 and my grandfather on my maternal side died from a heart attack when he was 32 y/o but they think that he had a congenital heart disease. Thank you so much for reading!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  You have an unfortunate personal and family history combo. The symptoms are very likely due to anxiety-related problems, especially since they seem to respond to a great extent to Klonopin. However, anxiety can sometimes wind up masking actual medical problems, so, given your family history as well as your weight and smoking history, these new (or changed) symptoms should not be dismissed out of hand. While you've had some pretty good cardio exam results, what you describe is more like classic heart symptoms than the previous ones. Again, this can be due to anxiety, since the anxious patient tends to see somatic sensations through the lens of the thing which makes him or her anxious. If you have a chronic concern with the possibility of heart disease you are likely to percieve symptoms in a way that evolves and adapts so that it seems more and more like the classic symptoms. This is not a judgement of you, the patient, who has no direct control over (or awareness of) this process. And still, it doesn't mean the symptoms cannot be, at some point, real. So again, they mustn't ever be dismissed out of hand.   I think perhaps asking your doctor for a referral to a cardiologist would be reasonable, given your personal and family history, maybe even moreso because of the anxiety problem, since it makes it more difficult for everyone involved to differentiate between preceived and actual cardiac symptoms (the symptoms themselves are real regardless -- the question is, are they heart-related or anxiety-related). Your therapist can certainly play a big role in this as well, but a cardiology consult may help ease your mind and also help you to learn better ways to tell when you're having anxiety-related somatic issues and when they may be \"real.\"   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you, and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for replying! I feel the same way. I know that anxiety can cause these things but I have always felt that the symptoms I experience warrant further testing, just to be safe. My doc on the other hand has said, and I quote, \"Any cardiologist would laugh @ you.\", because of my personal habits, which I know are bad and create further anxiety! But any medical doctor would realize, I hope, that its' a vicious cycle...you are anxious so you smoke, drink, and overeat and then what you fear become real! Its' awful and I am trying desperately to get off the \"hamster wheel\", so to speak.  But you have validated for me what I felt in the beginning of all this...that I need to be evaluated by a cardiologist! Thank you again for your response. I don't think you really realize what a difference you and your colleagues are making with this website, I know a lot of people, like me, who don't know where to turn and this is an excellent alternative with common sense advice and answers! Thanks again and I'll let you know how things turn out!\n\n",

I think you're doctor is way off base with his \"...any cardiologist would laugh at you\" comment, as most cardiologists -- and most MDs in general -- are a lot more professional and a lot more compassionate than that. I'm glad you have a good understanding of the situation and I think that will serve you well. You know what your part of the job is, which is great (not everyone will take responsibility for their part in staying healthy), and your doctor would do well to get on board with that attitude. At any rate, I'm sure you'll find a cardiological consult very helpful one way or the other. Again, glad I could help. The doctors and nurses here on the site are just awesome. It's great to hear compliments like yours directed at the people  who make this thing work. Best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Ok I feel like a dork posting this but here goes. I'll be as brief as I can   30 years old male non smoker very very light drinker I do have a weight problem I was as heavy as 380 but now down to 318. I walk twice a day total of 1.5 to 1.8 miles a day I climb stairs I bowl I swim and I am beginning to do some lifting.   FOr the last few months I will sometimes get tightness that seems to start in my back right around the left shoulder blade and it will wrap around and I'll feel the tightness in the left side of my chest. SOmetimes also I'll feel an achey burning in my back between the shoulder blades and it will sometimes wrap around the ribs and I'll feel a slight pressing on my chest. Every now and again I'll notice a spasm in the left chest not painful just feels jumpy for a split second and then gone. Seems muscle related tightness in the pectoral and back muscles? I would liken it to someone pressing a hand on the chest nothing terrible but enough to notice. Seems benign enough but these symptoms drive me insane. I have seen my Dr bout this stuff and we did a workup. BP is moderate it runs high during anxiety attacks but when I am clam it's not bad it's like 120/82 last time I had it checked it was 123/78. Total Cholesterol is fine it's like 170 Blood Sugar is like 93 my BP has been getting better and better as I have been excircizing when I started I'd get reading like 143/89 so I am really proud of myself. My Dr says it's really pretty silly for me to worry about my heart since I am doing well at taking good care of it and with the acitivty I do he says even if I had minor cardiovascular disease I'd be terribly fatigued. Yet the symptoms and my anxiety about them presist. My dad is 61 has BP that is under control by meds and my mom is in top shape and she is 56. My maternal grandfather died of a heart attack at 45 but he had malaria in the war and was a chain smoker and drinker my mothers brother also died of a heart attack at 58 but he had type 1 diabetes.   Could my anxiety be causing all of this? I do get the ocasional panic attack I had one a few night ago at bout 2am got up out of bed and it freaked me out good ole heart racing my shoulder were tight but no tightness or pain in chest. and of course it all went away like panic attacks do.   30 is way too young to be worrying about something like angina isn't it? Especually with the tests I've had done and the excircize I do? I guess mostly I am looking for some peace of mind here I am sorry if I am a bother. EKG's have been done once even during a panic attack and they've come back strong and good. MY Dr always comments when he listens to my heart \"man you got a strong heart it sounds good\" How do I stop worrying bout all this stuff so I can just enjoy life?  Thanks for your time M\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  First, you shouldn't feel like a \"dork\" for bringing this up. The prospect of heart disease at any age is quite frightening and can produce a lot of anxiety. What offsets the obesity issue (which could cause early coronary artery disease in some people) is the fact that a) you tolerate significant exercise very well and b) you've had EKGs which show no indication of heart disease. These are very promising findings. The  thing your doctor could (and probably should) do, both for your peace of mind and to be relatively certain his assessment of your cardiovascular health is correct would be to subject you to a stress test, preferably with nuclear scan. The latter may not be practical, given your current weight, but even a plain stress test without the nuc scan should  help verify the soundness of your heart.   I would congratulate you on your excellent weight loss progress and urge you to keep on working hard on that, and to also say Good job on the excellent exercise program. As for the symptoms, while they are atypical for heart disease, that alone isn't going to make your concern go away. You apparently suffer from panic disorder (or at least occasional panic attacks) and this always complicates the issue. The discomfort you're feeling is very likely due to a combination of tension due to chronic anxiety which occasionally crescendos in a panic attack, and you have also undertaken a lot of physical challenges which would involve the upper body's musculature, so the odds are that these are the reasons for the back and chest discomfort. Awareness of these sensations is always heightened in the anxious patient anyway, which leads to a vicious cycle of concern, anxiety, and eventually panic.   I certainly hope this has been helpful. Keep on doing your terrific job of taking care of your body. You're highly motivated and on your way to really excellent health. Best of luck to you and please stay in touch with us here. It sounds  like you're doing everything right, but if you really want to proceed with an easy mind, I think a negative stress test should really help put your mind at ease. Other than that, learning to quiet one's self, practicing meditation, relaxation techniques, etc.,  are often quite helpful in breaking the anxiety-panic cycle. Just bear in mind that wanting to not think about worrisome symptoms means not thinking about not thinking about  them! That's quite a trick, but it can be learned.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello I thought I would check back in. I'm down to about 315 losing weight very slowly partially because of changes at work I went through a department change and went through changing and the schedule didn't allow me to walk like I wanted to for the last few weeks but am getting back into it now. Can walk a mile or more at one time with no shortness of breth and no chest type pains. Most of the aches and pains I feel(as discribed in privious post) occur when seated perhaps to bad posture leaning forward abdoment pressing against chest a bit. A Chiropractor I am seeing thinks I coud have Hiatal Hernia which from my own study could explain pretty much every symptom that I have except tightness in left shoulder and back ache below shoulders. The pain is never ever enough that it stops me from moving around but it is noticble enoughto make me go \"hmmmm what's going on\" the symptoms never worsen but they presist. The Chiropractor used AK muscle testing tocome up with her hiatial hernia theory and where I don't know if I completly trust in the use of muscle testing for diagnosis her understanding of the symptoms makes me think she could be onto something. I have not asked about stress test I am a tad bit nervous about the invasive nature of nuc test. Are there risks involved? Also would a non evasive CT Scan checking cacium images around heart be a good route to go or is that a no go I've heard some folks sware by the test and some say it's hogwash.  Oveall I feel better occassional acheyness in the chest which again always seems to resonate from somewhere else which I can usually dismiss as skelital muscular issue and it passes fairly quickly. I have ben checking my resting heart rate when I first wake up and it's usually around a 63.  Your thoughts? ANd thanks for your time as always\n\n",

    "content": "Regarding weight loss, you're still  doing well, and slow and steady is the way to go with a deliberate, large weight reduction anyway. Just keep up the good work.  It also sounds as though you are doing well with the pain problem in general, and your hiatal hernia theory could certainly be correct, even including the symptoms you seem to feel don't \"fit\" that scenario. The pain can  be diffuse at times. It's  something worth looking into.  As for the stress test vs. CT cardioscan, the stress test yields more information about the functioning of the heart, and there is also a chemical type that can be done without the treadmill (adenosine or some similar drug is injected via IV to increase the heart rate and workload, then shut off -- it eliminates very rapidly -- when the goal is reached). This could be a third-way measure for you, although stress tests are generally safe, though by nature not utterly risk-free. Then  again,  living with undiagnosed heart disease is pretty risky too. Stress tests in essentially healthy populuations have awfully small risks attached. Any of the three tests would probably be better than none of them, with one of the stress-types preferable, since if the CT shows anything you're going to need to do one or another of the stress tests anyway, for the previously mentioned reason that they can yield information the CT cannot. Ultimatel, however, it's your decision.   Hope this is all helpful. Please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lightheaded, chest tight, short breath",
    "content": "Hello -  It is always possible to have more than one thing going on at the same time, and this may be the case with you. While  I believe the diagnosis of panic attack, and while I suspect it was brought on or at least triggered by the exposure to ammonia. You also apparently did have a respiratory infection, which sometimes helps to put things over the edge anxiety-wise. While the  infection would likely be cleared up now, once one has had a panic attack they tend to recur. This is unfortunate,  as this leads to chronic anticipatory anxiety and a belief there is something seriously wrong.   One of the classic pictures of chronic anxiety (whether or not punctuated by panic attacks) is the  sense that one cannot breathe properly. Another part of the picture is a vague, inexplicable sense of dizziness or lightheadedness, often caused by faulty breathing due to anxiety and stress. (It also can be caused by coincidental vertigo, and this is easy to determine by a trial of one dose of meclizine, brand name Dramamine \"non-drowsy\"). If this makes the giddiness go away, it was vertigo. If not, it is probably part of the generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and there are excellent prescription anti-anxiety drugs, but it's always better if the stress can be managed and the patient learn to recognize and abort these problems on his or her own.   There is also one other thing to consider, and that is the question of your having been and possibly still being exposed to mold. This can sometimes account for odd, annoying symptoms. Hopefully that isn't the case, but it's one other possibility.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome.   I'm glad the sensation of shortness of breath has gone away. I can't imagine an ENT telling a patient a chronic sinus problem can't be causing lightheadedness, since it often affects the inner ear provoking mild to severe vertigo. What I don't know, though, is whether your lightheadedness feels as though you are about to pass out, or if it is more a matter of dizziness and a sense of the room moving. The former could be due to a drop in blood pressure, the latter would definitely be vertigo. If turning your head, looking upward, or hanging your head off the end of a bed cause an increase in lightheadedness it is very likely vertigo related to the sinus problem. If it gets worse when you stand up from sitting or lying it may be due to a transient drop in blood pressure or it could be due to the  varying pressures in your sinuses, despite what you've been told. Let me know if any of these things apply. If it's not a low-blood pressure problem, then meclazine (as Dramamine or generic) could likely help control the lightheadedness.\n\n",

    "content": "37 male, 210, 5'10\"   For the last year and a half I have been noticing worsening conditions that up until now neither my GP or other related doctors can seem to track down.   am getting more and more concerned that while the solution eludes them, something really bad is happening.  Currently my specific concerns are - listed in order of primary to secondary  1. Breathlessness, even with slight activity. 2. Very general bone pains - specifically along the lower frontal rib-line 3. A dull pain most notable on the left side of my chest. 4. Blood in nasal mucous - most notable in the mornings.  Generally clears up throughout the day, but is very worrisome. 5. Notable sweating during light activity  Initially DX with Lyme Disease, but after this last year not convinced that several of these conditions have anything to do with Lyme.  The DX was barely positive, and I have not been convinced.  I have smoked in the past - (20 yrs 1/2 pack a day), and really think that is where the problem lies, but every single doctor that I have talked to has been redicent to confirm that.  I have been working on quitting, and that has gone fairly well.  After many visits to have Xrays, CT scans, and MRI's nothing has shown up and I an starting to think my Dr may have decided that alot of it is perhaps in my head.  Of course, I do not think so, and my surrent condition really is worrisome to me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Were you treated for Lyme disease? And have you had follow up testing for it? This set of symptoms could possibly be due to Lyme's. Again, you may be correct that something else is going on. The symptoms  are vague enough as a collection, to make a  guess as to the cause difficult, but I would suggest at least a thorough physical and maybe an echocardiogram to rule  out any structural heart abnormalities, which is the only other thing that comes to mind (and this is deliberately vague, as there are too many possibilities in that area, some of which could actually be caused by Lyme disease if it is present).  Please do follow up with us here, and if there is any further information it would be helpful in trying to figure out what's going on.   Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Tight left arm, slight chest tightness, fluttering in throat",
    "content": "Hi there -  While the fluttering sensation is common and can be due to premature contractions of the heart, either atrial or ventricular (PACs or PVCs), they are harmless. They also frequently are accompanied by a feeling of the need to cough. As for the coughing between the episodes, well, that may just be due to needing to cough.   The arm sensation is something heard of on occasion from people who have premature heartbeats, especially, for no known  reason, among those who are eventually diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse (MVP), which also is almost never of any real consequence, although some who have this also are prone to a clear-cut but somewhat non-sensical set of symptoms (syndrome) that includes not only palpitations but also unexplained anxiety, fatigue, and even migraine headaches. Again, it's nothing truly serious, but these collectively can be crazy-making.   Then again, you're mainly just complaining of palpitations and chest and arm tightness. These are as I've already said, fairly common and not generally serious,  but it's always best to know what's going on, and a resting EKG and possibly an echocardiogram should make it possible to rule MVP or any other heart-related issue out -- or, though unlikely,  in. Either way works, because if you know what's causing your symptoms and it's manageable or not significant,  then you can  really relax about it, and if there's something that does need attention (once again, very unlikey) then it can be treated and, again, you can relax.   This was probably more of an answer than you were looking for, but while the symptoms  you describe are extremely common and almost always insignificant, I would be remiss in just telling you to forget about it. Besides, understanding what's going on is usually far more than half the battle.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Satya -  While the  pain sounds like it involves the left ulnar nerve pathway, the most prudent path would be to first rule out cardiac problems. While the visible swelling at the focal point of the pain suggests this to  be non-cardiac, the location and nerve pathway are  also shared by pain originating in the heart. While  I suspect this is due to some other cause,  I think it wise to eliminate the more serious possibilities first, then look at the other possibilities (ulnar nerve compression, rib-muscle problem of undetermined nature, etc.) via a neurologist.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While this sounds like an orthopedic problem most likely, the fact that it starts up after (but not during) sports concerns me just a little.   If you can reproduce or aggravate this pain by movements or manual pressure on the  location, it isn't heart-related.  If you can't, and if it doesn't occur during exertion but does immediately after, are there any other symptoms that occur along with it? Again, if not,  it is likely not heart-related. A very simple way to rule heart issues out (or, less likely, in) would be for a doctor to perform an electrocardiogram and also to probe the area of your spleen for possible enlargement (again, unlikely).   Let us know if you can describe the precise location of the pain, and whether or not you can reproduce it by any sort of movement or contortion, or by pressing on the site of the pain.  Please get back to us on this. While  it really doesn't sound cardiac-related, I'd like to be reasonably certain before sending you on your way.\n\n",

    "title": "PVC's, Anxiety, and Chest Pain",
    "content": "First, I am an extremely anxious person. By nature, I am a worrier. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder in 2005, and I'm also a hypochondriac. I'm 21 years old.  I currently take Pexeva for anxiety. I also smoked for two years, but I quit a year ago. I'm overweight, but recently adopted a more healthy lifestyle. I exercise, and eat better, and I've lost 15lbs so far.  My question is I'm prone to PVC's (I assume they are PVC's because my mom gets them), I'm not very concerned about the \"skipped beats\" especially because since I cut caffeine out of my diet, they happen much less frequently. What I'm concerned about is a dull ache I get in my left chest above my breast. One doctor I talked with told me it was most likely muscle cramps between my ribs, or at the worse, benign chest wall pain that is brought on by stress. I get this dull ache almost daily. It is not brought on by exertion, and exercise seems to help with the ache. I have been extremely stressed recently. I have a lot of family problems, and I've noticed if I think about it, the pain gets worse. Half of me thinks it's something to do with my heart, and the other part of me thinks it's cancer or something like that. I've had a small lump on my neck for years that I've been told is harmless, it hasn't grown in size, but it is hard. Sometimes I think that it's cancer that's spread to my chest. Wow, do I sound crazy or what? I don't have insurance, or a family doctor, so going to the doctor is a little difficult.  My question is, do you think this sound cardiac in nature, or even something I should address? Or would you chalk it up to stress like most of the other people have? As I said, I'm a hypochondriac, so I sometimes make things a lot worse than they really are. Any input would be appreciated. Thank you!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: PVC's, Anxiety, and Chest Pain",
    "content": "Hi there -  Have you been diagnosed with hypochondria or has a medical person actually called you a hypochondriac? The reason I ask is that this is a separate condition from somatically-based anxiety, and often makes it difficult for a person to get proper care because eventually everything becomes \"all in the head.\" Your feelings, your sensations, are real. Whether or not they are significant is what needs to be determined, and all of us have to deal with that from time to time. If you are a very anxious person at least you recognize it, and how it can cloud the picture. This still by no means should allow anyone to dismiss your symptoms out of hand.  There. I feel better about  that now, as it is a sore subject with me and I hope the \"hypochondriac\" tag has been self-applied, because you then can  probably discard that. It's enough to deal with anxiety. But let's get to your immediate concern: Your pain is a very legitimate concern, although it does sound non-cardiac in nature, based on certain things you've told us about it, as well as its location and character. Part of that involves recent stress you mention and the fact that you experience the pain  when you think about \"it\" (either the stress or the pain -- I'm not certain which you meant, but it doesn't really matter). It could definitely be an inflammation of chest wall muscle or of the  connective tissue between the upper ribs near where they connect with the breastbone. Pressing firmly on the affected area may well produce some tenderness, which almost certifies that it is inflammatory (this connective tissue inflammation is known  as costochondritis or Tietz' syndrome and is harmless; it responds to over-the-counter anti-inflammatories such  as Advil or Aleve). You also say the pain is not  brought on by exertion, which cardiac pain would be. In fact, you say it tends to go away with exercise, which pretty much rules out any cardiac cause.  As for cancer, something no one  wants and is a scary subject for many of us, keep in mind that most cancers are quite advanced before they begin to cause pain, so chronic pain with no other symptoms preceding it rarely signals a cancer problem. The knot in your neck has already been diagnosed as innocent, so I think you can safely let the cancer concern go.   You don't sound crazy, though, no. Anyone who has these symptoms  and doesn't feel some concern would sound closer to crazy, unless they had a medical background. The question is a perfectly legitmate one. I'm happy to be able to tell you that with  the information you've provided you've given me enough to feel very safe in telling you I don't believe you have either a heart problem or cancer (based on the current symptoms). I'm not so sure you're a hypchondriac, either. Anxious maybe, but there's a lot of that going around.   I hope this is helfpul. Please follow up with us as necessary and thanks  for bringing your questions to this site.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the response. It really made me feel better about all the symptoms I've been experiencing.  To clarify, though, the hypochondria term is not self applied. I was diagnosed with it when I was really young. Third grade to be exact, after years of thinking I had cancer or AIDS. It was my third grade teacher that convinced my parents to take me to the doctor. I've been in therapy for it before, but it's something I've been learning to manage myself, and of course, the Pexeva takes the edge off a bit. I was diagnosed with a panic disorder when I was 18, which the doctor said goes hand in hand with the hypochondria, which I can see, but am not sure that's the case. Anyway, off subject, I know. I tend to not want to tell doctors about my diagnosis, because instead of treating me how they would treat a \"normal\" patient, I feel they overlook things because they think it's \"all in my head\". And when I go back because I feel I was treated inadequately, it presents an even bigger problem. I've stopped going to doctors before because of this. I do admit I'm a bit annoying, as sometimes I really don't believe a doctor's diagnosis, and will look up every symptom until I find the illness that's going to for sure kill me, and then I return to the doctor. I can't help it.   But I really do appreciate the response. Thank you so much!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 24 year old female, 5'8\", 220lbs.  I am fairly active, and I travel a lot - I just got back from spending 3 months in the Middle East (I doubt this is relevent).  I have a family history of heart disease and high blood pressure.  Although, I have never had any problem with either of these.  Also, my father died of an anuerysm.  I take Nexium and Yaz daily .  About 6 months ago, my doctor prescribed Nexium for acid reflux, since I had the constant sensation of something stuck in my throat.  After a few months on Nexium, that sensation went away, and I haven't really had any problems since. However, for the last three days, I have been having a dull achy pain in the center of my chest.  It started right after I woke up, and it felt like a burning sensation right between my breasts.  I assumed it was heartburn, so I took several Rolaids and an extra Nexium.  The burning sensation went away finally, but later in the day I took a nap, and when I woke up the burning had been replaced with the chest pain.  The pain has been pretty much constant for the last two and half days.  It is a very mild pain, and is pretty much centered along the breastbone.  It bascially just feels dull and achy, although there is a slight heavy feeling as well. I have also noticed that I am belching a bit more than is normal. Other than that, there are no other symptoms.  I have tried everything, including Rolaids, extra Nexium, and GasX.   I am assuming that this pain is caused by acid reflux, but I want to make sure that it isn't something more serious.  Is this something I should go to the ER about, or could it wait until I am able to see my family doctor?\n\n",

When I take a deep breathe, cough, sneeze or excert myself the pain gets worse.  I can't lay on my back, left side or stomach.  I can lay on my right side and few ok.  I have also had periods of lightheadedness and on the first day felt nausea and started to sweat.  My pulse rate increases also.  I happen to be in a local pharmacy and took my blood pressure on one of those machines and it was 141/94, few minutes later, 137/93, few minutes later 129/87.  I have spoken to my doctor about this before and he kinda shrugs me off because I have an anxiety disorder.  This is not anxiety, I know my body too well.  I just don't know if I should see a cardiologist or some other specialist or let it go.  Thank you in advance.  By the way, I am 38, female, 5'6\", about 170.  I am a smoker.  Kim\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While women certainly can (and do) develop heart disease, I don't think this is what's going on in your case. It's unfortunate that your doctor doesn't look beyond the anxiety problem, which is so often the case (especially when the patient is a woman), as this can cause a problem to be missed.   The fact that your pain is both position-sensitive and movement aggravated takes it almost completely away from the potential for heart problems. It is very likely either a musculoskeletal problem (Tietz' syndrome, an inflammation of the connective tissue between the ribs where they connect to the sternum), a recurrent repetitive motion (lifting?) injury, or perhaps a chronic pleurisy problem, where the outer lining of the lungs (the pleura) becomes irritated or inflamed, causing sometimes excruciating pain that can be felt in the affected side of the chest, sometimes radiating up into the shoulder or the base of the neck. This is  not  generally serious,  especially when chronic, but pain is pain, and should be dealt with. Pleuritic pain usually responds very well to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofin or naproxyn (Advil or Aleve over the counter).   The one way this could be remotely connected to your heart would be a chronic or recurrent peridcarditis, which is similar to pleurisy but affects the sac surrounding the heart instead. Often lying flat on one's back provokes the pain, while sitting up causes it to go away. While this is less likely than pleurisy or chest wall muscle problems, it is possible, and again is not generally dangerous, although in rare cases it can get severe enough to cause some cardiac compromise (by pressure inside the sac or due to adhesions between the sac and the surface of the heart). This doesn't sound like what's going on, put pericarditis is a remote possibility. By the way, it is usually treated with the same medications used to relieve pleuritic pain.   I would definitely seek out another doctor who is willing  to look  past your history of anxiety (and yes, many anxious patients really do know their bodies better than most), to determine if there is an inflammatory problem that can be easily treated. A simple listen to the chest with a stethescope and a good ear can determine if there is a friction rub either in the pleura or coincident with the heart's beating. Even if nothing is audible, a trial of ibuprofin or naproxyn would likely relieve the discomfort.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as necessary.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you doctor for replying.  My EKG done in my doctors office a week ago showed a long heart beat.  He sent me to a cardiologist and she sees what he is referring too, it is 3 spikes, up, down, up.  She doesn't feel it is signifcant and nothing to worry about.  She did hear a murmur and 3 years ago I had an echo done and it showed minor leakage in my valves but again she doesn't think it is significant.  She had me do my scheduled echo and wants me to have a cardiolite test done.  If she shes nothing significant is it necessary to do the cardiolite?  I am chalking it up to muscle strain, pull or something other than my heart.  Thank you for responding.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again -  You're welcome. Your EKG with the \"long\" waves (usually referred to as \"deep\" or \"tall\" waves) can be a normal variant, or sometimes reflects some degree of thickening of the heart muscle (which also can be normal or benign) and sometimes even indicates an unusual positioning of the heart, which is almost always benign and normal for the patient in question. It definitely warrants the follow up echocardiogram, just to see if there is any visible structural reason for the deep waves. If not, the Cardiolite stress test might be called of. If not, I would just go along with it, as it will either show nothing, in which case you can really relax, or, on the off chance it shows something (very unlikely), then at least you'd know what it was and what it would require to keep it from becoming a problem.   Again, if the echo is negative, the Cardiolite test might be moot, but if the doctor urges you to do it anyway, it's really not a big deal (inconvenient, I suppose, but that's about all). This will all help you to feel better about everything. Please let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 44 years old and on 7/31/08, while driving back to work, i felt a flutter in the center of my chest, no pain, just like 3 or 4 bubbles moving up. I started feeling kindof weak and like I needed to catch a breath, I had no pain, just a funny feeling of weakness and shortness of breath, like I might pass out. I drove myself to the ER where i was admitted and they did chest xrays, blood work, and a nuclear stress test the next morning where they got my heart rate up to 167 and the cardiologoit found no abnormalites other than my BP was 179/109 when I walked into the ER. I was released on 5mg of LInsiprol for HBP which I began taking. I felt okay when I left the Hospital but by about the third day I was feeling weak and did not want to eat anything. I also felt my heart beating hard, but not fast when i layed down or sat down. I went back the doctor and told him i still did not feel right. Based on my father's history of heart problems, he sent me to a Cardiologist for a CAth. I had a Heart cath on August 12th and the doctor told me I had \"great looking arteiries\". I still seem to have trouble getting back to normal. I have started walking/jogging 4 miles a day and haved changed my eating habits. I have lost from 270 on 7/31/08 to 244 as of 9/25/08.(I am 6\"2\" tall) I came off my BP medicine after the cath and now my bp runs around 135/85 sometimes a little higher sometimes a little lower. My pulse rate in the morning is around the high 50's low 60's. My FBS is around 110 each morning. I still feel tight in my chest, sometimes feel like a lump in the bottom of my throat, and when i am sitting or laying down, I can feel my heart beating hard, but not fast. This is really bothering me. I had a full blood workup done a few weeks ago and everything was normal (Lipids were: LDL 105, HDG: 31, Chol: 155, Trig: 205). Is it just stress or do you have any suggestions?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Can Feel Heart Beat when at rest, tightness in chest",
    "content": "Hi plowboy -  The initial sensation you experienced sounds like it was probably a \"salvo\" of premature heartbeats, something that happens fairly commonly in the general population. Sometimes we notice them, sometimes not. If the timing is right they can be very alarming, and one thing leads to another, anxiety-wise, and we wind up at the ER. You've now had an absolutely complete cardiac workup and have been declared very heart healthy. That's the good news. The bad news is that anxiety will stick with us more tenaciously than heart problems sometimes. Your rather high BP on  arrival at the ER was undoubtedly due to your alarm over what you preceived to be something wrong with your heart. This happens to a lot of people, and they usually aren't placed on medication right away, but followed up, usually with a normalization of BP such as you now show.   You've lost a lot of weight in a fairly short time, which will change a lot of things, especially the way you perceive bodily sensations, so that may, in part, account for your newfound awareness of your heartbeat. So long as it's not fast or irregular there's no reason for concern over this, even though it didn't happen before. Oh, and before I forget, congratulations on that big weight loss and keep up the good work!  All your other numbers are absolutely wonderful. Your heart is clearly in excellent health, but you may have now developed some anxiety problems. Hopefully as you continue to improve your overall heatlh by losing weight,  staying fit, etc., this will start to go away (you have to get used to the \"new body\" and its new sensations, which is still a work in progress). If it doesn't go away, by all means bring this to the attention of your doctor. If necessary there are some very effective anti-anxiety medications that can be tried, but it's always better if you can learn to manage anxiety and stress on your own.   I really believe if you can get a handle on the anxiety and stress you will feel like a new man. Concentrate on the awareness that you have been proven to be extremely healthy (you run 4 miles a day! That alone is extremely impressive) and try to just let go of the subjective sensations you have become aware of. I know, it's easy for me to say, but trust me, it can be done, and you'll enjoy life a lot more if you're able to do it. It will also be another tremendous accomplishment in which you can take pride.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Doc,  Thanks for your response. I went back to my GP for a checkup on 10/1 and he put me on some Prevacid. I did not mention in my other post that about 8 months ago I had woke up in the middle of the night choking on yellow stomach bile. It took me about 45 minutes to get straightned out and it burned my windpipe and throat like you wouldn't believe. I burp and belch constantly and he thinks I probably have GERD, which is probably right. I have felt better already in my chest concerning the tightness, although I sitll notice the \"forceful\" beat of my heart which I have never noticed before. About a week after the CATH, I called back to the Cardologist office and spoke with a nurse and told her I still had the sensation of my heart beating \"strong\" and \"forceful\" but not fast or irregular as best as I could tell. She said that they had checked my \"plumbing\" and all of that was fine, unless I had an electrical problem. She said I might want to wear an 24 hour holter moniter. I mentioned it on 10/1 to my GP and he did not think it was neccassary to wear a holter moniter since they had monitered my heart for 24 hours back on 7/31 and also did several EKG's and also a cardilogist had monitered my rythem during the treadmill stress test. I don't' know what they check beside your arteries during a CATH, but I guess they check the heart and can tell if if is not pumping right. So I have made up my mind to try to put the \"forceful\" beat out of my mind and live my normal life and trust in God, since I have done my \"due diligence\" and look for that awareness to go away. Thanks again for taking the time to respond to my post.  Blessings to you,  PlowBoy\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again -  You almost certainly do suffer from GERD. This is usually more of a problem at night because one is horizontal and stomach contents, which are supposed to stay in the stomach, are able to wash back up into the esophagus, as you described. This is what sometimes causes otherwise inexplicable asthma, too.  I'd have to agree with your cardiologist that a Holter monitor would be redundant this soon after the last one, unless, of course, you developed some concrete new symptoms suggesting significant heartbeat irregularity. Forceful beating is not the same, and while it is annoying once it's been noticed (and hard to stop noticing) is is often a simple matter of perception only.  During a cardiac cath (angiogram) the arteries supplying the heart are visualized for shape, smoothness, and the presence or absence of plaque of actual blockages. During this procedure the doctor is also able to measure the size of the chambers, the way they move (normal or sluggish), can visualize the aortic outflow tract for obstruction, and can measure the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). This is very nearly all the important information there is to be known about a given heart. So you're in good shape there.   Best of luck with the plan to start trying to let go of the awareness of your heart's beating, and give the whole thing over to a higher power, as you certainly have done your due diligence. You should do just fine.  You're very welcome. Thanks for using this site, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Raulo -  This is a peculiar symptom to have following RFA, and probably is not related, but rather one of those really annoying coincidental things. Your RFA, I take it, was successful, which is great. Your EKG and echo are normal which pretty much rules out a heart issue. You say the shortness of breath occurs every 2-3 hours. Is there anything else you can relate it to or correlate it with? Does it happen after eating? Do you experience any abdominal bloating during these episodes? How long does the shortness of breath last? All these things might help clarify the matter. It is unfortunate that this had to happen  right after an RFA,  because then one is prone to assume it the two would be  related, but there's really nothing in the information to suggest this, nor anything I can  think of which would tie them together in any event.   If you can add any information it would be a big help.\n\n",

So I went to the emergency room and they did all kinds of tests such as an ekg, they tested my thyroid, a brain scan, and tested alot of my blood for clots or anything else that could be wrong and all of it came back fine with no signs of any problems. Also my blood pressure was 120/80, my pulse was fine, and breathing was really good they said. They told me that I had a very severe anxiety attack and I have had a history of anxiety for almost 3 years untreated. I have been under alot of stress lately due to my mom just having surgery and us in the process of moving. And ever since i went to the emergency room ive been feeling like chest tightness and tingling and it runs into my left arm along with alittle pressure it feels on my throat. I went to have a follow up a couple days ago and the doctor said my left shoulder was very tense and she said its my back shoulder muscle that is giving me the trouble and she put me on 500mg naproxin. I asked her if she thought it had anything to do with my heart and she said it didnt because it would have came up on my ekg and she said im too young. I am over weight but every check up i have im very healthy. ive just been extremely on edge lately thinking something is going to happen to me or they missed something or im dyeing because of the tightness. i don't know how to relax and i was wondering if you think it is anxiety or if its something more serious. I just need all the opinions i can get to calm down.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: chest tightness and tingling",
    "content": "Hi there -  It's strange but true that often the last person to recognize an anxiety problem is the patient suffering from it. Since so many aspects of anxiety both affect and are affected by behaviors of the heart, this usually winds up being the center of attention during acute, unrecognized anxiety and panic disorder.   Having had an extensive workup which has ruled out every scary thing that could have otherwise accounted for your symptoms (which were classic for acute anxiety or even a panic attack), I think you can rest easy in the knowlege that your heart and other vital systems are fine.  It can be really hard to let go of the object of anxiety once we've been caused to feel as though something is wrong internally, and even really extensive and competent medical testing sometimes is insufficient to reassure the anxious patient. You're also at an age when this problem first expresses itself this way.   A panic attack commonly begins with a complete unawareness of stress or anxiety, and often the patient had been very quiet and seemingly relaxed just prior to the onset. What sometimes happens is that, subconsciously anxious, the patient has been sighing deeply (from worry, stress, etc.) and this throws off the PH balance of the body, by exhaling too much carbon dioxide, the component of air which gives the brain the message that its owner needs to breathe. What happens then,  is that there is no apparent impulse to breathe, so the subject feels stifled and tries to breathe even more, which throws off yet more CO2, with the eventual result of what's called hyperventilation. During this situation the patient may feel he or she cannot get any air in at all (actually the brain is just getting  the message it doesn't need any), and a full-blown panic ensues, the heart rate shoots up as adrenaline is released, tense muscles in the upper body begin to hurt or even go into spasm, causing chest pains, and hyperventilation has the odd effect of causing tingling and numbness in the face and hands, often with numbness around the mouth  and in the  hands and spasm in the hands. The  collection of bizarre symptoms convinces the patient something horrendous is happening (heart attack, stroke, loss of mind, ect.) and, well,  you know the rest.   Once this has happened there is often a tendency to allow it to happen  again. Hopefully reassurance will help you to recognize this when it's starting to happen again, so that you can abort an attack on your own. Try, if this happens again, to consciously relax, breathe slowly, through your nose, and consciously release your voluntary muscles, one group at a time. Often this practice can help avoid having to resort to medication to abort or prevent the attacks. The sooner the problem is recognized, the better the chances of making this go away or at least become manageable.   It can be really tough. It's a virtual certainty you're suffering from generalized anxiety and possibly panic disorder as well. Knowing this early on can often keep it from becoming a huge disruption.  Learning to deal with life's stresses, such as your mom's surgery and especially the  upcoming move (this can be a huge stressor!) is a challenge, but if one  is aware of them, it becomes easier.   I hope this is helpful and that you will follow up here with us as needed. You're going to be fine, but if you can't enjoy being fine it's not much fun. Please stay in touch with us here.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: burning - pain sensation in chest",
    "content": "Hi Andrea -  All your cardiological tests are normal, so the problem is very likely not your heart, although I would be the last person to just wave it off as impossible. Still,  it seems extremely unlikely due to the extensive workup. Because of that we need to consider what other problems can sometimes mimic heart pain. There are quite a few.   While you say this doesn't feel like heartburn, there are degrees and  qualities of upper GI pain, depending on the origin of the problem. This sensation could be caused by a sliding hiatal hernia, in  which a part of the stomach actually slides up into the chest through a herniation of the diaphragm. This can cause heartburn-like  sensations, but can also cause varying degrees of pain and pressure not unlike that of angina, sometimes even worse. This is one thing that needs to be ruled out. Also, certain foods can trigger spasm of the esophagus that is not heartburn, but which feels almost identical to angina. There are also chest wall abnormalities and inflammations which can cause this sort of sensation. They are usually duplicable by manual pressure on the spaces between the ribs near the breastbone, and sometimes by certain movements of the upper body.   Chronic, generalized anxiety is also frequently marked by chest pain, usually sharp or stabbing in nature, and usually (but not always) confined to the area of the left breast. Faulty breathing patterns, caused by anxiety, can also cause the irritation of both chest muscles and the connective tissues between the ribs.  Finally, more and more we are seeing asthma present with chest tightness and sometimes pain as well as soreness, due to unconscious use of accessory muscles.   All that said, it should go without saying that if you should experience significant chest pain or pressure, especially if it radiates to either shoulder or arm, or to the throat, neck or jaw, and especially if accompanied by shortness of breath, nausea, faintness or weakness, one should report to the nearest emergency room anyway, as it is better to be safe than sorry. However, if the symptoms you're currently having are persistent over a long period of time, do not change, and aren't aggravated by exertion (this last is especially important), then the likelihood is great that this  is  either caused by anxiety or is a relatively benign problem.   I hope this helps somewhat.  It's never possible to make a diagnosis from a distance, but given the negative test results and apparent stability of your symptoms all suggest this is something other than heart-related.  Best of luck to you. Please follow up with  us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Last night I was awoken by severe cramping in the upper chest area, just above the breast. It felt like when you get cramping in the back of your leg, same kind of pain, I wasn't able to move or get out of bed and had shortness of breath.  It went on about 20 min. My husband figured it was probably a muscle cramp and suggested I lay on my back with my arms up to stretch/relax the muscle and it did seems to help relieve the cramping thought not the pain but I finally  relaxed enough to get back to sleep.  This morning the area feels really tender and I feel really tired.  I am a 40 yrs old women and I am a smoker. Do I have any cause for concern or was my husband probably right ??\n\n",

Sometimes we can stretch in our sleep and cause a very painful muscle spasm and that sounds exactly like what you experienced. Hopefully this won't become a routine thing, but it really does sound muscular.  I hope this helps ease your mind. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 26 year old with pain in ribs and left side of chest",
    "content": "Hello -  This is one  of those really bothersome presentations that can take some doing to unravel. While the description of the focus of the pain would  seem to be too far to the left and too low to be heart-related, it is odd that it sometimes radiates down the left arm and that you get tingling in the fingers on that side. There is also that pain and/or tightness n the jaw and neck. Now if all this is not aggravated by exertion, that would argue against a heart-related problem  (as does your young age and the normal EKG). Since the discomfort tends to come on at rest I am suspecting this is  caused by occasional  trapped gas in the splenic flexure of your large intestine, which can refer pain all the way up into your chest, shoulder, arm, neck and jaw, especially when seated or bent at the waist.  If, however, this pain is aggravated by exertion (walking, running, lifting, etc.) then there would be a need to rule out some more obscure heart-related problems such as a thickened left ventricle, which is uncommon but is seen sometimes in young  people, especially those especially athletic. This can be ruled out usually by echocardiogram.   The most likely explanation is gastrointestinal bloating causing pressure on the nerves in the diaphragm which, as I mentioned earlier, can refer pain all the way up to the neck, jaw and left arm at times.   I hope this helps. If you have any further information or if there is any related family history we should know about, please let us know.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 30 yr old female, currently 34 weeks pregnant.  I have a 5 year history of hypertension controlled on meds, and am a smoker.  Several months ago, I started having difficulty swallowing, well, the mechanics worked but things (in particular tablets) would get stuck on the way down, it felt like at the level of the suprasternal notch, and generally after some time of extending and turning my neck they would be swallowed.  In searching my neck for a lump, I noticed a strong palpable pulse in the notch, and this pulse is also visible.  I am a nurse and have a basic understanding of anatomy and do not recall there being an artery in this area.  I am concerned that this could possibly be a thoracic aortic aneurysm, compressing my esophagus.  I also get on occassion a tightening and pulsing type pain in between my shoulder blades and traveling down my spine, moderately severe but lasting only a few seconds, not associated with any type of activity or movement.  In addition, not sure if this is important or not, have frequent palpitations that have been identified as PVC's on telemetry.  So, my question is, are these symptoms likely to be benign or indicative of something more serious, like an aneurysm?  As I am pregnant, I am reluctant to seek out imaging studies at this time.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: difficulty swallowing and pulse in suprasternal notch",
    "content": "Hello -  Well you certainly have posed an interesting dilemma. While the new  pulsing at the base of your neck could be something you just never noticed before or even could be due to your being pregnant (things tend to get pushed up as well as out), there needs to be some certainty that this is not, for some odd reason, a thoracic aneurism, since that would be a major consideration in the delivery process.   Since you have a history of hypertension and you smoke, there is a slightly greater risk of aneurism than if those factors weren't present. And while age usually is a big factor in aortic aneurisms, there is always that genetic wild card. So it seems reasonable to want to rule it out. How to do that safely is the big challenge. Probably the safest way to accomplish this at this stage of your pregnancy would be to attempt an ultrasound of the base of the anterior neck, which might well show up your anatomy there. It's the least noxious type of imaging technique where the baby is concerned, and while it's not ideal, it could clarify things a good deal, depending.   The difficulty swallowing, the pulsing in the back, and the apparently new pulsatile area at the base of your neck could all be by-products of pregnancy, but they also could be symptoms of an ascending aortic aneurism, although your age argues against it. Clearly x-ray, MRI and CT are out of the question unless there is some compelling reason to employ those. If an US was to show up anything suspicious, then it would be more reasonable to consider more sophisticated imaging. Also, a careful listen by a cardiologist with a good ear, directly at the site, could perhaps help steer the investigation of this. While the odds are against it being an aneurism, and while  pregnancy could be causing all these symptoms, it is just suspicious enough to warrant a closer look. Those PVCs are of no consequence at all, and they are likely to become more frequent  during pregnancy than at other times, but have no intrinsic diagnostic value at all.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you, and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 25 yr old male that has been experiencing chest pressure for the last month or so.  I am also feeling a bit of pain every once in a while that comes and goes.  The pressure is constant.  I went to my primary doctor and had an EKG and chest x-ray.  He said he was concerned about a collapsesd lung since I am tall and skinny, but the x-ray didn't show that.  He sent me home with an anti-inflammatory that has not helped at all.  I stopped taking the medicine after 2 weeks of no help.  I have also developed a bumpy red rash that has localized on my elbows, knees, and hands.  I returned to the doctor thinking it was an allergic reaction to the medicine, but he didn't think it looked like an allergy since it was so localized.  The strange thing is that I had this rash years ago and blamed it on Doxycicline and that is now listed as an allergy of mine.  Is it possible that my doctor didn't look at my heart on the x-ray since he was focusing on the lungs?  The x-ray was from my side and my back (did not take a straight chest shot).  My doctor now thinks that I may suffer from asthma at times, but I passed all the asthma tests while at the office.  Would asthma cause constant pressure and shortness of breath sometimes?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It would certainly seem at least likely the doxycyline allergy has been overlooked and should be brought forcefully to the doctor's attention.  As for the other, original symptoms, asthma seems like a very likely suspect, as it often presents insidiously with chest tightness and even soreness (due to use of auxiliary muscles to compensate for the additonal work of breathing) and the shortness of breath also, of course, fits with this possibility.  I question both the failure to order a plain chest x-ray, even though I really doubt it would reveal much additional information. I really think asthma needs to be explored more fully -- but the first order of business is always to rule out the most serious possibilities first, even if they seem unlikely.  I'd go back or see a different doctor and in either case not accept a cursory exam and no diagnosis. This should have been a lot easier.  I hope this is helpful to you.

    "content": "Hello -  From  the pattern of nasal  stuffiness following ingestion of food. it makes me suspect you're allergic to something you're eating. Just the presence of food in the stomach (or its components in the bloodstream) won't cause nasal stuffiness, but if there is a protein allergy or some other specific food allergy, even with the healthiest foods, a reaction can be triggered. Are there specific foods you eat routinely, or at least a food group you like and eat a lot? Usually allergens are protein-based but not always.   If you're unable to find the root cause of this, you may need, at least temporarily,  to take an antihistimine to prevent the problem. It's not as unusual as you might think.   Please get back to us about this with any additional information that might apply, but especially as to your diet. We may find there is something you're eating that can be eliminated that will solve the problem.   Best of luck to you. Stay in touch.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chest pain after alcohol consumption and food",
    "content": "Hello -  The first thing that occurred to me as I was reading your post was GERD also (gastro-esophageal reflux disease). While chest pain brought on by running is generally associated (at least in the thought process) with heart problems, it also can be caused by GERD, and the fact that alcohol also triggers the same symptom does suggest GERD first and foremost. Alcohol can definitely aggravate acid reflux, as can tobacco, caffeine, citrus fruits and juices, and even whole milk. But alcohol is one of the more potent aggravants.   While you clearly should be evaluated by an internist or even a gastroenterologist, you could also try an over-the-counter reflux drug like Prevacid, ranatidine (or Zantac), or Prilosec. If any of these seem to alleviate the symptoms you can be fairly certain the problem is GERD. It still should be evaluated medically, though, as there is usually no direct correlation between the discomfort experienced and the severity of the problem, which can cause damage to the esophagus over time, if not treated. There are many excellent prescription drugs if this is the diagnosis.  I hope this is helpful and please do follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: tickling sensation in chest with PVC's",
    "content": "Hello -  Some people do describe the sensation of premature heartbeats as being accompanied by a \"tickle\" sensation. It sounds as though you are having occasionally frequent premature beats, although whether they are PVCs or PACs (the latter often seem to cause reports of a fluttering or tickling sensation more frequently, but I have no idea why).  In either case, bending can often cause the premature beats to become more frequent because the  abdominal contents are compressed and pushed up against the diaphragm, crowding the heart, which is already irritable and doesn't like to be \"touched.\" It is a fairly normal phenomenon, and the only concern it raises at all is the fact that you have a positive family history of early heart disease, but this is somewhat balanced by the recent comprehensive cardiac workup, all negative.   PVCs and PACs are extremely common in the general population, and are of little to no diagnostic nor prognostic value,  but can be very annoying and irritating, and can at times be the source of a great deal of anxiety and distraction. Avoid caffeine when they seem to be more frequent, try to do some relaxation exercises, and generally do your best to ignore the palpitations unless they bother you too much, in  which case your doctor can, if necessary (for your peace of mind only) prescribe a beta blocker to reduce the force and frequency of the premature beats. This is sometimes done for people who simply cannot tolerate the sensation of frequant premature beats, but usually only if all non-medical measures fail to help.  I hope this serves to ease your mind somewhat. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again -  It's almost always best if one can ignore palpitations (unless the occur in conjunction with a very rapid heart rate and lightheadedness), but it's not always easy to actually do the ignoring. This is why Holter monitoring or an event monitor (similar to a Holter, but worn for longer and able to retroactively record episodes within a minute or so) are probably more often prescribed to help provide the patient with reassurance rather than actually finding anything of significance. Still, for some people, one of the portable monitors can really help clear the air.   The other thing, and you mention it, is the medical management of really bothersome premature beats, usually via one of the family of beta blocker drugs. While some people react (at first) with some lethargy, it almost always wears off, and usually with the newer cardioselective types (long-acting metaprolol is one of those with minimal side effects) the frequency of \"skipped\" beats can be reduced, starting out with the lowest possible dose and working up to an effective one. It's not terrible, although some of the earlier beta blockers really could make one feel as though walking around in a fog, feel lightheaded, etc., the cardioselective ones are generally well tolerated, if that becomes something to consider.   It's still best, if possible, to ignore them. Sometimes having a Holter monitor or 30-day event monitor reassure the patient there really is nothing significant going on will have a positive effect and the things will start to happen less or at least be noticed less.   Those are two possible actions your doctor could take if you find yourself unable to ignore the symptoms (and believe me, I do understand why certain people just can't manage this without some help).   As for the omega 3 fish oil, it has been found to have a very salutary effect on heart health, and there are some very limited studies (and a lot of anecdotal evidence without much scientifice evidence to back it up) that it may help reduce the frequency of PVCs, etc. If taken as directed it can't do any harm, and may actually have a positive effect, so I wouldn't argue against it, but would simply say that if it doesn't do what you need it to do there are still those other avenues open to you medically.   I hope this is helpful. Please stay in touch as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  I can't think of any reason (other than sheer coincidence) that Clindamycin would have caused your current complaint. It sounds as though your doctor has taken the conservative approach and treated for possible heart disease and is having you follow up appropriately. You are in an age group where it is possible to have heart disease  begin to present itself, so the best thing would be to rule  this in or out, and once that is established, move on from there. If your heart is causing the symptoms (and it could well be) then you'll want to know so as to make informed choices as to how to manage it. If not, that will be a relief and you can  then work on the less worrisome possibilities.  Please let us know what comes of the cardiology consult.\n\n",

    "title": "costochondritis or heart attack?",
    "content": "I hope that I receive a response because this situation has had me worried.  I am 38 female, 260 lbs, 5'7\" with type two diabetes well controled. A1c of 5.8  Here is my story so you can see what recently happened and if you think this is a GI incident, costochondritis or heart related.  Last Sunday night at 2:30 am I woke up with what I thought was horrible gas trapped in my upper GI (I had eaten a huge tub of movie popcorn on Saturday afternoon.  that evening I felt yucky from all that ruffage and just wanted to get it out of my stomach so I could feel better- and I made myself throw up (tried 7 times in one sitting because I was hoping to get that rich stuff off my stomach.   I had felt fine all day Sunday so I thought that this discomfort below my breast line was trapped gas from the popcorn. I had three Phazyme pills and two rolaids. Got to sleep but then woke up at 4 am with it back again. It was painful and constant..like a gnawing pressure/moderate discomfort.   Of course, I became alarmed when it didn't go away- constant. Woke my husband up and we were both concerned but thought it was just bad gas. I went to my chiropractor at 10 that morning hoping she could give me a manipulation to get this 'gas pocket' to moving.  She did my regular adjustment but also used her clicker along the  upper ribcage below my breasts which were already very tender. This made it worse but she said it sounded like I caused trauma with the throwing up - made sense. The whole time in the car for the hour drive I was in pain...couldn't get comfortable. Any pressure on my back from sitting, reclining or laying down hurt more. I felt a tiny bit better by leaning forward but this also caused pain with my breast pressure on my ribcage.  My back was a bit sore before the chiropractor but better after the adjustment.  By 1 p.m. I had to go see the local doc to get a pain pill. I described it and she said it was costochondritis. Now, my blood pressure was 150/90 which is high and my pulse was 123- I have big time white coat syndrome. I had been in constant pain for almost 12 hours, how could I not be stressed? She gave me Celebrex and Tramadol (which hardly helped at all). The Tramadol seemed to take an hour to kick in and gave a small amount of relief for an hour or less. I also took a muscle relaxer which helped some. At no time yesterday did I get 100% pain free.   Went to bed at 10 and slept for 12 hours thanks to the muscle relaxer. Woke up Monday a.m. with no pain at all. Is this typical that costochondritis can sometimes last a day (in my case 18 hours?). Doc assured me it was not a heart attack - I did not sweat, run temperature, want to throw up or feel the pain move. It was constant gnawing hurt in the same unilateral area for 18 hours. She did not run any blood tests, just went off information I told her to give me a diagnosis.  It was the worst feeling I've ever had. Does a heart attack produce 18+ hours of chronic pain and then when it ends you feel totally fine again?  I just don't want to worry that this was a heart incident and I've got damage by not going to the ER. Today is Thursday and I feel fine again. I'm taking 5 days of prednisone which has made my BS soar and a rapid heartbeat but I've been told that those will go back to normal when I stop.  I am still taken 2 anti inflammatory pills a day but have not had to take the Tramadol since Monday.  Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: costochondritis or heart attack?",
    "content": "Hello -  FIrst, my apologies for not having gotten to your question sooner. We've all been trying to catch up here. Hopefully you are feeling better by now.  To answer your questions, costochondritis can, indeed, last 18 hours and sometimes a good deal  longer. While heart issues were ruled out, to answer that part of your post, it is possible for a coronary event to cause pain for that length of time as well, then go away, but it  is rather unusual, and given all the other findings, I doubt very much that this was a heart-related episode.  Tramdol is an excellent  pain reliever, but for costochondritis, the first choice of medication is usually a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofin or naproxyn, because costochondritis usually responds better to one  of these due to its being an inflammatory process.   It sounds to me as though the initial discomfort may have been caused by the popcorn itself (rather than gas,although that  could have added to the discomfort), since popcorn is peculiar in its being slow to digest or even move along the GI tract, especially in large quantities. The attempted forced vomiting probably irritated things even more. This all sounds rather like  what might  be expected after ingestion of a large volume of popcorn. Costochondritis could, of course, have been a secondary result of the forcefulness of vomiting, so that everything may have occurred in a cascading fashion.   The heart rate/high blood pressure is consistent with White Coat Syndrome, so probably had little to do with the episode itself.   I hope this is helpful and that by now you are feeling a good deal better. Please do follow up with us as needed. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

I guess that is good to know at least.  I believe you are right and feel better with your agreement that this was not heart related.  The one thing this has taught me is to be careful with our bodies and little things can cause big problems!

I have been to my primary care physician and he did an electrocardigram that was normal also some type of blood test to rule out cancer which was also normal.  I also had a chest xray that was fine.  He really couldn't give a reason for the pain.  I am now seeing a pulmanary doctor who has done a test on my lungs, I don't know exactly what it was but he said that the test was better than anyone he has ever tested.  He started me on Nexium, (almost 7 weeks), for possible acid reflux but this doesn't seem to be doing any good.  I am at a point where I don't know what to do or where to go.  The lung doctor wants me to have a test to rule out asthma but he said he really didn't think that was it either. This has been going on for too long and is a real inconvience.  If it is something serious I would like to be able to try and correct it.  If its not I just want it to go away.  Could you please point me in the right direction.

    "content": "I'm a 47 year old male, 5'9, 165 lbs.  I mountain bike several times weekly and monitor my heart rate with a re liable heart rate monitor.  I've been riding regularly for over a year.  After I've warmed up - approximately 15 minutes of easy riding on pavement to the trail head - my heart rate is in the 130s (beats per minutes).  However, once I begin riding in the mountains on a slight incline, my rate increases to and stays in the 150s.  At this level, I experience no breathlessness or chest pains and can easily hold a conversation.  During technical ascents and descents, I regularly will hold a heart rate in the 180s to 190s for up to 15 minutes. During these periods, I do not experience chest pain but become breathless.  My concerns:  a) Why hasn't my heart rate slowed as my fitness level has improved?; b) Is holding a heart rate in the 150s with peaks in the 190s for up to 1.5 hours hazardous for a 47 year old in reasonably good condition?  I did have a nuclear stress test last year that was 'normal'.  I have a family history of heart disease (father, living, bypass at 40, several stents and angioplasties / grandfather on father's side, fatal heart attack at 40 / father's brother, survived heart attack at 42).

    "title": "Re: Male, 47, high heart rate when exercising",
    "content": "Hello -  It is difficult to quantify or compare your biking exertion with a stress test, in which all the parameters are controlled and follow a certain protocol, but it might be worthwhile, at the intensity of exercise you're working, to have a stress test done just for a baseline. In general it is wise to do so anyway before undertaking a rigorous exercise program. After a year, however, it would seem you are probably working at a normal output (for you) although a resting pre-exercise rate would be useful in assessing the effectiveness of your program (resting rate with this sort of program is usually on the slow side, between 40s and 60s as a rule). It is your resting rate that would slow significantly due to the exercise program, but rate should  increase significantly during the sort of exercise you describe. Since you don't experience any chest pain and your shortness of breath only occurs at peak exercise you are probably not doing any damage, assuming you maintain proper hydration during. However, it  would make  sense to have a cardiac workup including stress test, to be certain you are actually fit to be doing this, even though the fact you are able to would seem to attest to that fitness. The fact is the exercise may be working for you but you still could have some degree of heart disease. Probably not, but it would  be better to be certain, especially because of the family history and the level of intensity. I''m guessing a workup would probably show you to be in extraordinarily good condition, but it also would be prudent to know for sure.  Hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

I've been to the ER twice for this mainly because of the breathing issues. I've had a chest x-ray, numerous ekg's, ct scan of chest, pulmonary funtion tests, echo, all came back normal, Then my pcp sent me for an upper endoscopy which also was normal besides two superficial lesions in my stomach, he took biopsies of those and they were benign, he put me on prilosec twice a day, then he ordered an abdominal ultrasound and blood tests cbc,lft and lipase, the ultrasound came back normal but I havent gotten the results of the bloodwork yet. my pcp seems to think if all the tests come back normal that it might be anxiety. I also wanted to mention that my nose is also always stopped up,I'm taking zyrtec for that and it is helping. I am also taking medicine for hbp and cholesterol as it runs in the family. I'm really worried about this, do you have any suggestions? Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hard to get a deep breath",
    "content": "Hello -  I think, based on your description of the symptoms, that it is very likely the problem is due to anxiety and possibly compounded by the nasal congestion. I'll explain:  Anxious people  tend to sigh a lot without realizing it. As they do this, not only do they throw off CO2, which then makes them feel as though they can't draw a full, satisfying breath (CO2 \"tells\" the brain the body needs air, and sighing causes it to be exhaled in excess, sending a confusing signal to the brain), but the sighing also causes them to swallow a certain amount of the air, which winds up in the stomach, causing bloating and abdominal upward pressure against the diaphragm, which also makes breathing feel \"crowded\" and more difficult than it should. Neither is actually serious or even what it appears to be, but the sensation of not being able to draw the deep full breath causes more anxiety, more attention to the breathing, more sighing, and more upsetting of the PH balance, with the consequence of a vicious cycle in which the patient becomes convinced there is something wrong with his breathing. It is only a faulty breathing pattern, not a physical problem.   Chronic nasal congestion can also lead to mouth breathing, which often, in turn, encourages sighing with the same problems as mentioned above.  Finally, Zyrtec (or any effective antihistimine) causes drying of the nasal passages -- the desired effect -- which, again, makes the bronchii feel as though air is not moving properly. All of this together can  result in a chronic sensation of inadquate respiration even though,  as you've pointed out, you are able to function normally.   I hope this helps resolve the issue for you and eases your mind. Good luck to you.\n\n",

For the past 6-8 months i've been having chest pains on the left hand side of my chest just underneath my armpit and sometimes radiates into my left breast and the top of my left arm. It's a dull throbbing pain. I went to the A&E department who did blood tests, chest x-ray and ECG's. They told me I had Pleurisy and my heart was fine. It eventually cleared up or so I thought but I keep getting these pains and i'm now starting to get worried again. Are they serious? Should I get it checked out again? Please help.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Left side chest and arm pains",
    "content": "Hello -  What you describe is classic pleuritic pain, so the diagnosis makes total sense. This is an inflammatory problem with the pleura, the lining between the lungs and the chest wall. It can become chronic or recur at random, and usually responds well to over-the-counter pain medications like ibuprofin or naproxyn. While  ten cigarettes per day is not huge, one of the things smoking can do is aggravate pleurisy, so if you are able to limit yourself to ten per day you can probably,  with some effort, cut that in half, and if you can do that, you can probably then stop smoking altogether, which is the only safe relationship with tobacco. End of sermon.  You undoubtedly are having a recurrence of pleurisy. It can be quite painful but is rarely serious. If the OTC meds don't help then by all means bring it back to your doctor's attention. It's not serious, but it can be awfully uncomfortable.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: left upper side chest and innerleft arm pain",
    "content": "Hi there -  While  there are a number of very benign potential causes of your discomfort (such as trapped gas, most likely at the splenic flexure of your colon, on the left side, which causes pressure up against the bottom  of the diaphragm and can send referred pain to the area you describe. This is probably the most likely cause. It could also be pleuritic-like pain due to heavier breathing during the walk, caused by some mild pleuritic friction. This is less likely but still possible.  While I strongly suspect you'll find the problem is caused by one of these annoying and harmless things, and even though your pain  is rather atypical for heart-related pain, there are several reasons I'd advise bringing this to the attention of an internist or cardiologist in order to be safe rather than sorry (and that, I feel, is always worth the trouble and expense): women frequently present with atypical heart symptoms (pain in the \"wrong\" place, etc.); further,  while heart attack pain is rarely felt in the left chest, exertional  angina often is felt there. You describe an \"aching pain\" which is far more like cardiac-related pain than sharp, stabbing pain, which is almost never  heart-related. Also,  this pain radiates to the inside of your left arm, which is classic ulnar nerve pathway radiation pain for cardiac causes. This certainly does not mean I think it is heart related. What I do think is that  where there is any question as to whether or not the symptoms in question are heart-related, and especially in  women (and young women even more especially) this needs to be ruled out. I say young women in  particular because they can have heart disease (structural as well as coronary) even though they are less likely than post-menopausal women. The problem is that many medical people,  because of the relative youth of the patient and the fact that it is a woman (there is still  an impression among some medical professionals that women \"just don't get heart disease\" -- totally baseless, but old notions  are slow to die off). So for all those reasons, I would hope you would have at least an EKG and  possibly an echocardiogram, maybe even a stress  test -- just to rule out any possibility of hidden structural disease or early coronary disease causing this problem. If your mind is at ease about that then you can continue your healthy, pleasurable walks and take your time figuring out what innocent thing is causing what would then be only an annoying problem.   I hope you'll follow up with  us here and let us know how things go. Good luck to you and please don't feel  I'm suggesting you have a heart problem. I just feel the investment in ruling it out is more than worth the time and trouble.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 23 year old with on-going chest pain",
    "content": "Hello -  First, the good news: the pain can be duplicated by postural changes (bending forward), and occurs in the wrong area for heart pain if isolated to this location, so we can set aside the heart concerns (mitral valve prolapse isn't usually a proper disease of the heart anyway, but we'll get back to that). Secondly, if burping relieves the pain it is also another disqualifier for heart disease. One can have gas trapped -- often at a distance from the location of referred pain  in fact -- and not only will it cause pain in the area you describe, but leaning forward can make it worse, especially in people who are even a little bit overweight. Burping, again, relieving the gas pressure, also relieves the pain.  Now then, for the bigger concerns: you describe yourself as having anxiety disorder. This is a far bigger problem than any of the physical symptoms it can sometimes cause or mimic, and can really hamper your enjoyment of life. So this needs some work. Also, you have been diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse (MVP). While this, in itself, is very rarely serious (and is often considered a variant of normal), it is frequently associated with anxiety and panic disorder, for reasons that are not entirely clear. People with MVP also more often have unexplained sharp, sticking chest pains, occasional shortness of breath (but usually good exercise tolerance), and sometimes fatique. Also acid reflux, with or without heartburn. Regular exercise and adequate  hydration tend to help with these symptoms a lot. There are others that sometimes show up in people with MVP as well, and they usually are suggestive of heart disease, but almost never does any actually turn up.  So the good news is your chest pains don't resemble heart pains at all, but you are anxious about them anyway, and that's normal -- at least if you can now let them go. However, anxiety is a very unpleasant feeling and while it can be managed very well, it does take some work on the part of the patient.   I hope all this is helpful, and if you have additional questions please do follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Given your history and symptoms I would feel it is now time for a thorough cardio evaluation including perhaps a stress test and definitely an echocardiogram. The phenteramine could possibly have caused damage to a valve, but the symptoms your're decribing are equally suspicious and vague, and could be due to stress, anxiety, or more recently acquired coronary artery disease unrelated to the phenteramine use. You really need to find out.   As for caffeine, given the 2 litres of Dew per day it's a wonder you sleep at night! That is a huge amount of caffeine and could actually be causing your symptoms (and is undoubtedly aggravating the palpitations). Easing off caffeine is not easy for everyone, and given you take in a huge amount you should probably start easing off slowly, but not too slowly. You do have to give your body a break, though. That's just way too much to be healthy, and tapering down to a reasonable level (a different drink, like some of the colas or just coffee, maybe 2 oz. twice a day as a goal) should help quiet your palpitations a lot, assuming there is no other underlying disease. Your negative exams are all too old to rely upon for reassurance with this new complaint, so please schedule a cardiac workup so that your peace of mind can be restored. Also try looking into some stress reduction methods for day-to-day purposes. Between the caffeine and the stress hormones I'm just really amazed at how well you function.   Hope this is helpful. Please do follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 54 y-o female, with obesity due to severe, long term (30 years), under treated Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. I was initially dx'd in September 2003. The doctor never gave me enough Synthroid and my condition slowly worsened until April 2007 when I started having cardiac symptoms. My complications stemming from severe under treated hypothyroidism are bradycardia, stage II hypertension, mild cardiomegaly, sleep apnea, and minimal endometrial hyperplasia.  I'm currently taking Synthroid, Progestin (for abnormal uterine bleeding due to side effect of Triamterene/HCTZ), and B12 1000mcg plus daily vitamins.  There's no family history of heart problems in my family. My father did have hypertension for a while and it was quickly corrected with dietary change, exercise, and short term medication with no recurrences. My mother has Hashimoto's, Addison's, and Type 1 Diabetes. My father and all three siblings have Ankylosing Spondylitis. I don't have AS or the genetic marker for it.   The cardiac symptoms were SOB, chest pain, dry cough, and fatigue upon exertion. When I started taking the diuretic the symptoms mostly subsided. However, 2 weeks ago they started worsening again. At that time I was on Triamterene/HCTZ for my hypertension. And I started having post-menopausal bleeding again (the hyperplasia) which had stopped.   The diuretic has been discontinued due to the bleeding. The SOB and fatigue is worse than 2 weeks ago and feels like I can't catch my breath. And my dry cough has returned. And I have more symptoms. Feels as though I'm breathing through a straw in a hot, humid room. The SOB, fatigue and dry cough occur after I exert myself such as fixing a meal. I sit down for a while and that relieves it.   Now if I do laundry or mop the floor or vacuum, I have fatigue, dry cough, and SOB afterwards and the SOB during the exertion. However, about 30 to 60 minutes (or more) later I start having the symptoms again. The SOB starts again followed by chest pain, fatigue, and dry coughing. Two days ago I had an episode after doing laundry and mopping the floor where I felt as if I was suffocating. I had to go outside to breathe. Slightly bending over my deck railing seem to help me breathe. Then I got chest pain, stabbing upper back pain, and shoulder pain. I took some pain medication that night and called my primary doctor the next day. I'm being referred to a cardiologist.   Also I have all over swelling with fluid, especially upper abdomen. And my feet and hands are cooler than normal especially after moderate exertion.  My primary doctor says I should be getting better by now since I've been on my new dose of Synthroid for over 6 weeks. She told me I shouldn't be having problems with exertion. My pulse ox was 98 sitting and after less than 3 minutes walking in her office with a pulse oximeter it was 92 and I had SOB. And she said I don't have heart failure.  Is that possible? Or is it cardiomyopathy? Or pericarditis? Or myocarditis?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I am a very healthy twenty six year old. In shape, non-smoker, rare social drinker. It was recently found that I had billary dyskpenia. After months of untolerable stomach pain, I agreed to surgery. During my pre-op, I expressed again what had been my only concern for many years, frequent heart irregularities, skipping beats and racing sometimes causing chest pain or shortness of breath. I was again told that my heart \"clicks\". An EKG was done and found borderline results. This was followed by an ECHO. My final report read trace tricuspid regurgitation. I told my primary and surgeon this. During surgery, I had what the recovery room nurse described as an almost uncontrolable SVT with a drop in pressure. I was given the proper meds and stablized. But, was forced to stay in the hospital days after for heart monitoring. A follow up echo done in the hospital stated, mitral regurgitation with defined mitral valve prolapse. My question is, had my doctors known this was my diagnosis could my SVT and aftereffects, that I am still experiencing three weeks later been prevented? (Of note: My first echo done three weeks before my surgery was done in a completely different facility than the hospital that did the second. They are not affiliated.) Thank you for taking the time to read my post.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: SVT AFTER GALLBLADDER SURGERY MISDIAGNOSIS?",
    "content": "Hi RebeccaSunnybrook -   Well, you do have MVP. The fact that it was missed during the first echocardiogram could be due to one of two factors.  One, the really interesting one, is that it is not always clearly present during every echo. Due to many different factors (including the fact that it can virtually disappear at times), it isn't always caught on echo the first time. The \"click\" murmur is a classic sign of MVP, though, and with a triad of click murmur, billowy or redundant mitral leaflet on echo, and certain mild, nonspecific EKG changes, the diagnosis is certain. It is frequently missed, and it is also somewhat controversial among some doctors as to what constitutes MVP absent the classic triad, so it could have simply not shown up on the day of the first echo, or it could have been mild enough that  the doctor who read that echo didn't feel there was sufficient cause to call it MVP. Now it's been caught. It is almost always benign (rare instances of progression to \"flail\" valve are the product of a different process), but it is associated with a whole host of symptoms, some of which seem almost crazy. For instance, a small subset of MVPers will also have migraine headaches or optical migraine (odd lights in the corner of the field of vision usually).   SVT is also frequently seen in MVP patients, and it can be a one-time thing or occasional. If it becomes a problem (it is difficult to function during a prolonged episode, if only because of the distraction), it can be eliminated, but if you have so far ony had it during a surgery, and this is sometimes a reaction to anesthesia in people with MVP,  you may not have it again. As for your question: Could it have been prevented? I have to say that since your first exam showed both the nonspecific EKG changes and the classic click murmur, two out of three should have at least warranted a notation on your chart and this probably should have been forwarded to the surgical facility. It may not have prevented the episode, but at least the team at that facility wouldn't have been caught off-guard and could have dealt with it more readily. Unfortunately, it  is a doctor's call as to whether or not to do this, and as I say, it probably wouldn't have prevented the SVT during surgery. This is one of those \"no harm, no foul\" situations.   All that being said, you can probably expect to experience more than the average frequency of palpitations, skipped beats, arrhythmias, etc., than the average person, because of the confirmed MVP, but it all doesn't really mean much in that this is almost never life-threatening, just really annoying. There are also, as I said earlier, a lot of other seemingly unrelated potential symptoms which also are mostly annoying ones, and it's not clear what the relationship is to the prolapsed mitral valve, but there is statistically a clear connection, so that  people who have this cluster of symptoms are said to suffer \"MVP syndrome\" or dysautonomia, or malfunction of the autonomic nervous system. Occasional fatigue, lightheadedness, the aforementioned migraine symptoms, occasional shortness of breath, and similar symptoms, can all occur with no rhyme or reason, or not at all.   Much of  this, if it becomes a more or less regular feature of life, is usually then treated with a beta blocking drug such as metaprolol. This, when necessary, is usually very effective.  Good luck to you,  so sorry you had to have this experience, but thankfully it is not actually dangerous and that there are ways of managing it. Hopefully by now you are feeling much better. Please stay in touch here.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Heart palpitations and mild back discomfort",
    "content": "Hello -  Palpitations such as you describe are most often premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). These are actually normal and the most common heartbeat irregularity. Sometimes, to a lesser extent, we may also see premature atrial beats (PACs) or even premature junctional  beats (PJCs). None are serious and PVCs are not of any diagnostic or prognostic value. They definitely are not associated with heart attacks. Although they can occur during heart attacks they also occur during health and normal activities. They are more common at rest, and especially at bedtime or when resting, when lying on one's left side, and after meals. They are exacerbated by caffeine, nicotine, antihistimines, and, in some people, by getting up and moving around after a quiet period. So they, alone, are not important, but they often, if percieved by the subject, can be the cause of a lot of anxiety, which of course is one more potential cause of PVCs. This last is the worst, because even though they are harmless and normal, they seem to come and go randomly at times, and if the patient can feel them they are hard to ignore. Some people become extremely worried about them, and then of course they have even more.   The discomfort in your upper back is a concern if only because it is pain and pain is a way of knowing something isn't right. Since you would seem, by history, physical exam and healthy habits to be very healthy in general and specifically as regards your heart, the upper back discomfort may be a postural issue. This is becoming more common the more people spend time in front of a computer. Just a thought. Something that would be helpful to know is whether or not the upper back pain comes on or is worse during exercise. In any case, if it causes enough discomfort it's probably worth a look. As for your heart, I would guess you are in excellent cardiac health.   It's interesting to note that some people have PVCs (and/or PACs) all the time and don't even know they are happening. Others have just one every once in a while but feel every one. It's not a choice, it's just the way we are wired. When you are able to feel them they are hard to miss, but it's important to not pay them too much attention if possible (this is not always easy). They won't do any harm, but the anxiety they can cause can actually be crippling to some people.  I hope this has been helpful.  Please do keep in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jerry,  You have not said what was the reason for your steroid therapy.  Chest pain and pressure in chest has several causes. However first of all I would like to reassure you that you at age of 22 are one of the less likely candidates to get a heart attack, although it is not unknown at this age.  Sometimes regurgitation of stomach acid in the food pipe is the cause of tightness in the chest. Bronchitis or Asthma can also result in chest tightness. Some allergy to pollens or dust is another cause.   Stabbing pain in the side of chest may come on after some muscle pull. Your profile says something about marijuana. This or the smoke of it may be the culprit.  Apurva\n\n",

    "title": "2 months irregular heartbeat/fainting",
    "content": "I am 37 yrs. old, female and have had an irregular heartbeat for a couple of months now, non stop.  I have had an irregular beat here and there over the years.  About 2 yrs. ago, I fainted 2 separate times under the exact same circumstances.  Both times, it was 4:30 a.m., and was awakened by my sick child yelling for me to come to his room, about 3-4 minutes after being with them, got very nauseous, lightheaded, sweaty, and fainted.  I did go to a cardiologist, had EKG, Ultrasound on heart, table tilt test, stress test, even had a test at a neurologists office to check for seizures, all came back negative or showing that nothing was wrong.  I did let them know that I have irregular heartbeats from time to time.  Last week, I was returning from Jamaica and took 100mg of dramamine, because the ride to the airport was 1 1/2 hrs. of curvy, bumpy roads and I get motion sickness.  In the airport, as I was sitting down waiting in a restaurant for food to come, I felt a little dizzy and a little queasy, put my head down on the table, and next thing I know, my husband is holding me up after catching me from fainting while sitting.  So, I have 2 questions, one is how normal is it to have an irregular heartbeat for 2 months, and the other is, should I have avoided the dramamine while having an irregular heartbeat?  I read (after the fact) that dramamine can cause hypotension and also palpitations, dizziness...but have taken it before w/no problems.  Could my already irregular heartbeat which has been ongoing, mixed w/the dramamine have caused the fainting episode?  I do have an appt. scheduled at the cardiologists, but can't get in for another 2 1/2 weeks, should I get in there quicker?? Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Dramamine containes Dimenhydrinate, a combination molecule of diphenehydramine and theophylline. Theophylline is a molecule known for its propensity to cause fast heart rate [tachycardia] and irregular heart rate [ premature atrial and ventricular beats]. If you are already sufferring from irregular heart beat, Dramamine can definitely worsen the situation.   The circumstances of your earlier two faintings like waking up in the night due to child's crying, which is naturally associated with anxiety,[sympathetic overactivation and arrhythmia] plus nausea, perspiration and passing out- prabably point to a serious ventricular arrhythmia leading to what is called Stokes Adams episode meaning fainting due to lack of blood supply to the brain resulting from ineffective heart pumping resulting from irregular and abnormal heart rhythm. In majority of instances such heart rhythm spontaneously recovers in a minute or two and one wakes up from the faint.  An extensive cardiological work up is called for in such cases. Your EKG, Echo, Tilt Table and stress have been normal as you say. Even then you must get in touch with your cardiologist as soon as possible. If she thinks fit, she might advise you to go for these tests again and in addition she may ask for some electrophysiologic testing too.  Meanwhile stay calm , don't panic, avoid all undue exertion, avoid situations that might provoke anxiety or severe stress.  All the best and I am sure you will be fine.   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again, I have another question-  I returned to the cardiologist for my Holter results.  It found that I have PAC's and PVC's and one instance of sinus tachycardia.  My question is (I forgot to ask the cardiologist, and am changing doc's actually) when I was having the extra beats, is it normal to have them continuously for 3 months straight or not?  They never stopped, it was a continuous thing, then one day, it ended.  He tended to think I was anxious about fainting, but I'm not- if it happens, it happens, I'm not an anxious person.  He said he wasn't concerned w/the PAC's/PVC's, but that the holter monitor showed my average heart beat per minute was 90 and he wanted to treat that w/a beta blocker.  But 90 is not my resting heart bpm- that is around 70.  I've checked it many many times at home, and if I'm up and cleaning, or doing things w/the kids it is 90ish, but lower when sitting and relaxing.  I don't think I need to be on a beta blocker for that- he didn't ask me what I normally do at home during the day, he just wrote me a prescription for Sectral, and said to take it and see how it works.  Well, I don't think it needs to be treated...and w/his seeming lack of interest in my 'case', I'm moving on to another cardiologist.  But, my main question is- were my 3 months of irregular heart beats o.k. or should he have taken that more seriously?   Thank you so much for your help.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 2 months irregular heartbeat/fainting",
    "content": "Hello cat512: While I have been away from the forum for a while, I'm back now, and getting back into the swing of things. I came upon your series of questions to doctor Madia, and while we wait for his next reply, I'd like to make a few observations, having read the whole thread.   First, the problem seems to have begun back with that (rather large) dose of Dramamine. While the ongoing problems may not be related to that anymore, they can often be triggered by something like that and then become self-perpetuating for a while. The dose of Dramamine (the original formula, apparently) was roughly twice the recommended maximum dose, so that, along with the stresses of traveling, could have triggered both your original heartbeat irregularities and even your syncopal episode. The fact that they continued on long after you'd taken that single large dose, however, suggests that was just a \"gateway\" experience and sometimes once the heart becomes irritable (for whatever reason) the premature beats can sometimes can trigger a startle reflex  even in a person not generally considered to be an \"anxious person.\"   It is \"normal\" for a given individula to experience a short or prolonged period of premature beats and if nothing else is found along with that, it is usually written off to anxiety, although it can occur without anxiety being predominate or even present. It is just a \"crankiness\" or irritablity of the heart muscle. Caffeine can certainly contribute, various non-anxiety-producing stresses, disrupted sleep cycle, etc. Many fairly innocent things can set this off.   It also usually goes away as abruptly as it begins, again often without any obvious reason.   Usually when a syncopal episode (simple faint) occurs it is due to a reflex action and is most often benign, but does warrant a workup. You've had one. The doctor found your resting pulse to be 90, and you state your normal pulse is 70. You know this because you check it frequently. This indicates a certain concern that the heart is operating in a \"normal\" fashion, and could betray a denied or unaware state of anxiety. Giving that the benefit of the doubt, our heart rates still do vary considerably during the course of the day, and running between 70 and 90 is hardly unusual. The addition of a beta blocker based on a one-time finding of resting rate of 90, especially if you are petite, seems to be a bit of overkill. Also, among the many beta blockers available, Sectral is less popular and less well tolerated by most people. It was originally marketed because it was thought to have a specific action against PVCs, which is now known to be less-than-unique to this drug. It also has instrinsic sympathomimetic action (ISA) which means it doesn't slow the heart rate as much as all the other, more popular beta blockers. While I am not a doctor, I do have a very deep experience in this area, and feel the prescription of Sectral to lean slightly toward \"overkill.\" You, of course, as the patient, have the right to decline any medication, and I think this moderate change in resting rate wouldn't normally elicit this sort of response from a doctor. If your rate were consistently above 100 and caused you marked discomfort, one of the more common and less unusual beta blockers (such as long-acting metaprolol, starting with a low dose) would seem to be the most likely therapy. You don't, however, sound like you need to be on drug therapy for this \"problem.\"   You might want to keep track of any future episodes of lightheadedness or frank syncope, though, and if this should occur you ought to report it to your doctor for further evaluation. It seems it was just an isolated incident, which is not uncommon.   I think it is opportune that you are changing cardiologists, and you might want to hold off on the Sectral til you've seen the new doctor. While the heart rate and irregularity issues sound very innocent, they may as well be mentioned to the new doctor in the context of the syncopal episode, and the fact that the \"old\" doctor wanted to prescribe Sectral even though he felt your problem was essentially anxiety-related. We'll assume, based on your own testimony, that that is an inaccurate finding as well, although we can sometimes fool ourselves pretty thoroughly where that is concerned.   At any rate, all you've described so far sounds pretty \"normal\" for an otherwise healthy young person.   Good luck to you, and do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for your help and information Mr. Kenyon.  I appreciate the lengthy response.       I did go to my 2nd opinion/consultation w/a great cardiologist.  He really took time to listen to everything, asked numerous questions, and spent at least 30 minutes reviewing everything and trying to figure out what is actually causing my heart to beat irregularly.  He pretty much said what you were saying about the Sectral.  He did not know why my previous cardiologist would prescribe that particular beta blocker...and also, he didn't think I needed to be on one at all.  He did say that if and when my heart beats irregularly again, to come in and they'll hook me up to an \"event\" monitor, and I'll wear it for 30 days to try and see what triggers my heart to beat like it does.  Throughout my entire life, for as long as I can remember, every once in a while, I've had an irregular beat, but lasting only a minute or less each time.   It was just that this particular time, for 3 months continually, then the fainting episode...I felt it somehow had to be related..but like you were saying, my cardiologist said it very well could have been drug related, due to the dramamine.  So, on top of the already irregular beating heart, and the effect of the dramamine (can cause palpitations and lower your blood pressure), it could have caused it to happen.  I feel good w/that, because I haven't fainted often, and that would explain that episode.  So... we left it at I have episodes of PAC's...due to something, trying to find that 'something' is where we are.  He said it was more of an annoyance/nuisance for me to deal with it, but essentially harmless.  As long as it's not life threatening, I'm o.k. with that.        I do have a question on caffeine though...I've tried to lessen what I drink (which I don't think was much in the first place- 2 cups of coffee in the morning, then maybe a glass of sweet tea, possibly 2 during the day).  What is considered a lot of caffeine??  Or, does it affect people differently?  Could that be a high amount for me, enough to make my heart beat higher throughout the day, or enough to cause a palpitation here and there?    Thank you again for all of your help! Cat512\n\n",

    "content": "Hi cat512 -   It's sounding like you've got a handle on this situation now, especially with the new cardiologist, who seems to be much more in touch with things. I think the Dramamine explanation works thus far, and of course if the problem starts up again on its own, a Holter monitor or event monitor (the latter is preferable for a number of reasons) would be a reasonable measure for sure.  There is one other possible cause which slipped my mind earlier, and which I haven't found mentioned elsewhere in this thread, which could have caused the sudden misbehavior: a low serum potassium level. This is not at all uncommon, especially among people who are traveling by air as you were. It can be due to simple dehydration, which is extremely common on airplanes in part due to the artificially controlled climate in the cabin and partly due to the failure to eat normally and regularly. Some people also, for various medical reasons (and quite often for no discernable reason), can lose potassium. Since Potassium is one of the electrolytes most essential to the proper function of muscles (and the heart is pretty much all muscle), a lower-than-normal level can often trigger premature beats and other random arrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, suprventricular tachycardia, etc.). Should the problem recur, if possible you ought to have blood drawn to see if this is a contributing factor. If it is, it's usually fairly easy to manage with proper diet and hydration or, in those occasional cases where there is a medical cause for it (or no discernable cause -- \"idiopathic\") there are long-acting supplements that can be taken to compensate. It can make a really big difference.   This latter is an often overlooked cause of some episodes of sporadic \"crazy\" heart behavior in otherwise healthy individuals. It's entirely possible this was covered during your workup, but at that time you weren't in the middle of an episode, so testing for potassium could come up perfectly normal. It's worth keeping in mind for sure.  As for the caffeine question, unfortunately the answer is \"It depends.\" Everyone seems to be somewhat different where this is concerned, and although caffeine is a stimulant, it may sometimes get a bad rap. You don't seem to be overdoing, but it may be that you tolerate it a little less well than some. It's been my experience and observation that even within individuals tolerance for caffeine may depend upon a lot of things. For instance, if you've been sleep deprived and/or stressed over a day or two, you might be a lot less tolerant of it than if you were well rested and relaxed. There are some people who actually drink coffee or tea just before they go to bed, and sleep fine that way. It's not something I would recommend by any stretch, but if someone's been doing that for years and it works for them, it's certainly not wrong. If you have an uptick in perceived premature beats you might, at that time, try cutting your morning coffee from two cups to one or leaving out the tea in the evening (or,of course, both) just to see if it makes a difference. If not, by all means don't deprive yourself.  Hopefully this is all moot and whatever caused the first go-round will wind up just being \"one of those things.\"   Best of luck to you and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 22 Year Old Male 5' 10\" 140 lbs.  In pretty good shape.  For 3 months now I am having pain in the middle to left side of my chest in the same spot but it comes and goes like a stabbing or pinching pain.  I also have pain in the left side of my neck, shoulder, bicep, forearm and hand but the pain moves spots all the time in my left shoulder/arm, and my left arm was actually getting tired after typing, carrying something moving it a lot etc.  I had 3 EKG's, 1 Stress test, all the blood work, and 3 chest x-rays and everything came back normal.  Except one Dr. took an EKG and goes interesting and says you are not having a heart attack but I would like you to see a cardiologist.  I saw the cardiologist they did the stress test and the tech who gave me the test said hmmm there is something interesting but the Dr. looked at it and said it is normal and I shouldn't worry about anything.  I had one more EKG after that, that came out to be normal.  This pain has brought on Anxiety/Panic Attacks.  I was put on .25mg of twice a day.  I got it down to half that twice a day and I see a psychologist.  The last ED visit the Dr. said maybe it is a pinched nerve so he put me on medrol and darvocet.  The Medrol did not seem to do much but the darvocet did reduce the pain.  I have been seeing a chiropractor now for 4 weeks and he says he sees compression in my left shoulder were he took the x-ray and believes it is a pinched nerve.  The pain comes and goes some days it hurts a lot some days it doesn't and it even makes my left hand go numb sometimes.    Overall the arm pain is getting a little better but the pinching chest pain comes and goes all the time.  The pain starts at the inside of the left pectoral and is localized there but sometimes I can feel it surrounding my left pectoral muscle into my shoulder.  I have been to the ED 3 times saw 3 different Physicians, 1 Cardiologist, and a chiropractor.  If I can solve the pain and know for sure where it is coming from I can stop these panic attacks.  The problem is once I tell a Dr. I have panic attacks they think that's why I have the chest pain but it is the chest pain the makes the panic attack happen, if I didn't have the pain I wouldn't have the attack and this pain and the attacks are taking my life away from me and I really need some advice.  Thanks, Lou\n\n",

    "content": "Hi HTX,  Chest pain is an annoying and frightening symptom. I fully understand your anxiety about it. However there are some facts about chest pain that I would like to highlight.  At 22, a chest pain from a heart attack or angina, though not unknown, is extermely rare. Heart pain usually is produced by some activity and subsides on resting. Besides a heart attack pain does not keep recurring like in your case, it is soon diagnised and resolved by treatment.  At your age pain from muscles , bones, nerves [yes pinched nerve too] is more likely. Also, some unusual presentation of a dyspepsia and gas formation can present itself as a chest discomfort.  Many young healthy individuals have some typical EKG patterns which at first sight in less experienced hands like technicians may be mistaken for an abnormality. Even Stress EKGs are known to be mis interpreted. But go by what your cardiologist says and try to divert your mind to some more fruitful activities.   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 19 year old male 6'1\", 260 pounds My grandfather and aunt have diabetes. Im not allergic to anything and I don't take any medicine  At about 13 years of age I was playing tennis, I was super-excited due to a heated game, all of a sudden my heart starting beating really rapid it lasted for 20-30 seconds and it stopped abruptly and started to beat regularly . Ever since it seems I've had chest problems, for instance when I was at work I was carrying a large stack of boxes and I was about to drop them, but tried to catch them and my heart started rapidly beating, lasted 20-30 seconds then abruptly stopped.  At age 15 I had a severe case of appendisits, large amount of puss were removed from inside me and I had to use a breatheing machine twice a day which I think expanded my lungs and they also tested how hard I could breathe outwards.  At 17 years of age I was doing dips at 24 hour fitness which puts a lot of outward load on your sternum and ribs, I was coming upwards and felt 2 of my ribs push outwards and I dropped to the ground, not because it hurt, because it was unexpected and gave a really weird tearing sensation. Went to the doctor and said If I have any more problems they will have to cut the end of my rib off, if i remember correctly  Now these are the problems I am currently having. My chest itches and sometimes is tingly on the left side. In the same spot it tingles I get pain 2-3 times a day that lasts for random amounts of time, some days I don't get any pain. This pain sometimes radiates to back which is in the same spot as the front just in the back. Sometimes when I breathe in really deep or completely depress my lungs I get a sharp pain on the left side of my chest.  Now for my rapid heart beats I don't believe my rapid heart beat is the cause of anxiety because I know what anxiety feels like.   As we speak I am having a chest pain spell, It started during intercourse after my heart beat a really  hard single beat. It is causing pain on the left side of my chest and back, I will get a sharp pain on the left side of my chest if I breathe in too deep or depress my lungs completely.  I think there might be a big problem with my heart, all i do is feel my heart beat all day long and dread that something might be wrong with it, I'm deathly afraid to go to the doctor because I am afraid of what they are going to tell me is wrong. Please give me some advice so I can get this out of my mind.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Extreme competitive sport puts a heavy stress on your body and causes a huge amount of tachycaria-fast pulse. Add to that adrenalin secretion which occures in competitive sport and adds to the tachycardia. This may lead to a flutter sensation, a different kind of abnormal tachycardia and even syncope.  Having passed through an episode you might become a little sensitized and may dread the occurrence which lead to tachycardia in itself.  However, don't have and escapist attitude, you must get in touch with a doctor and rule out any form of rhythm disturbances that may be occurring.   take care,   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Please help. I am a 35 year old woman, ex-smoker, 5 ft 4 and about 135 lbs. I don not have any diagnosed medical conditions and I\"m not taking any medications.   I've been walking on my treadmill 6-7 days a week for almost 3 years. In the last year I've gotten to the point of being able to walk at 4.3 mph on inclines all the way to 12 and running a mile at a time at 6.0. Every day I would go for 60 minutes.  I had been very pleased with my progress and it's become part of my day. 2 months ago while exercising I felt my heart 'hiccup', my legs went ice cold and my heart rate flew to over 185 bpm, I was dizzy, saw stars and felt sick and weak for hours afterwards.( no pain though)  One month later it happened again and scared me badly. I have decreased the time and intensity of my workouts over the last few weeks, but now it is happening almost every second day or more. I've tried to keep track and it seems like if I go longer than 30 minutes, OR if I go over an incline of 6%, OR if I run faster than 5.2 for more than 5 minutes.  It's happening so frequently now that I do feel it coming on , so I take steps to slow down immediately, I've purchased a heart rate monitor that I wear on my wrist. I'm just devastated - I had planned to run for a cause this summer, but now I\"m so scared to even work up a sweat after all these months of training - something's gone wrong.  Now I\"m also worrying about it which is making me feel more anxious etc - I've stopped all together on the treadmill because the last time ( 2 days ago) I was only walking on a flat surface at 4.0 and my heart took off racing again. I've just been doing yoga instead.  My doctor is extremely hard to talk to and will tell me the worst and prescribe drugs without listening to me. So thank you for listening. What could be wrong? I don't want to stop exercising - it's my stress relief and now it's become my stress!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: extreme heart palpitations only during exercise",
    "content": "Hi,  First of all congratulation on quitting smoking. It just possibly could lead to undue tachycardia [ fast heart rate].   When a person exercises, heart rate increases. At fast rates the Ventricles have less time to collect blood which it will pump out in next contraction. A very fast heart rate thus may lead to a stuation where cardiac out put goes down, one feels dizzy and some pins and needle all over.  If you are now becoming tachycardic even at low work load, there could be some situations like a supra ventricular tachtcardia or Atrial fibrillation. These are of some concern and they must be diagnosed or ruled out.  The best course of action in my view is to go for a treadmill stress EKG. This is the same as you do daily and in addition a monitor is tagged along. This will give a precise picture of what is happening when you exercise, whether there is Sinus tachycardia [normal], or SVT or AF. Check out with your doctor if you are an appropriate candidate for this test and there are no contraindications.  take care,  Apurva\n\n",

Since my procedure I have had ongoing chest pain, in the middle of my chest, left side, left arm/shoulder. The pain is intermittent but on a daily basis. I also noticed an emotional component, since the ablation, I have been very \"teary\" cry very easily for no apparent reason. Prior to the procedure, I did not have the daily chest pain and was not depressed.   I saw my cardiologist today, my ecg was normal as well as an echo. My doctor feels that my heart is in very good shape and the pain is likely to be non-cardiac related. I'm worried though, that something is wrong despite the negative tests, especially since I did not have chest pain prior to the procedure. My question is, what could possibly be causing the pain and is it usual to have an emotional reaction like I'm having after an ablation.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Bobbie,  SVT is an arrhythmia seen in many young individuals and a cause of either syncopes or palpitations. Once successfully ablated the manifestations disappear.  Neither SVT nor its ablation is the cause of the chest pain you describe. Chest pain occurring after a certain amount of exertion and subsiding on rest is generally the one that could be of heart origin. Chest pain occurring randomly has more to do with anxiety or musculoskeletal system.  The fact that you have crying spells indicates you are having some emotional outpouring and anxiety, this is a common phenomenon after any major operation or procedure.  I advice you to stay cool, try not to think of it and may be ask your doctor for some anti anxiety pills.  Take care,   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "I read the forums and did not find anything like mine... Im a 21 year old female and have been having some very strange chest pressure lately. A few days after me 21st birthday, I started to notice a tightness in my chest. Its not really painful, just an extremely scary feeling and an inability to catch my breath. I thought this was very unusual so I went to my doctor who said it was probably just my hypoglycemia, but did an EKG and bloodwork anyway. Bloodwork was fine but my EKG came back abnormal, so I went for a stress test. The day of the stress test I felt fine and my stress test came back normal. Later that night, however, I had the same chest tightness. I have been having these onset of symptoms very heavily in the morning and sometimes before bed, but I feel them lightly all day. In the morning I wake up feeling nauseous and within an hour I feel like I am struggling for air. I get dizzy and lightheaded. The symptoms get worst as time goes on and last for about 30min to an hour and then begin to fade, although they never really go completely away. They have been getting has progressively getting worst, despite the fact that I have been on a hypoglycemic diet and eating 5 times a day.  I am just desperate for answers. I cant get into my dr. office for another week and I am struggling just to make it day by day. Ive done my own research and I don't feel like its a panic attack (even though my mother gets them) because it doesnt feel like a \"world is ending\" situation, just an onset of chest pressure. Im half tempted to head to the ER during the next \"episode\" just to see if they can catch it in the moment. Are there other tests that can be run? Is there a drug that fixes this sort of thing? I just cant function in my daily life like this.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 21 yr old, abnormal EKG, chest pressure",
    "content": "Hi,  First of all one must know that there are several reasons to get 'tightness in the chest'.  One is of course heart disease and the classic symptom called angina is described as tightness beneth the breast bone. This generally comes on after some exertion and subsides on rest. However it CAN come on without any activity too if it is an unstable Angina. Angina is the result of narrowings in the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle. These narrowings result from deposition of fat and calcium on the inner lining of the vessel wall, a process called Atherosclerosis. However it is a fact that young females upto their menopause are generally spared from Atherosclerosis as their Estrogen hormone seems to give them some protection. Thus Angina in a young female like you is possible but not very probable.  Another cause of tightness in chest is Bronchitis or Bronchial Asthma. Here the Bronchi or wind pipes of the lungs go into a spasm either because of some allergy or some infection. This could also be associated with a wheeze.   Acidity, dyspepsia or Acid reflux from the stomach is also a reason for tightness in chest. Here the valve between the food pipe and the stomach is somewhat lax and acid which is normally there in the stomach regurgitates up in the food pipe, leading to a spasm of it and a feeling of tightness.   Your abnormal EKG I cannot comment upon without seeing but many of EKG changes in young females are known to be 'non specific' or inconsequential.  In my opinion you must see your doctor and get thoroughly checked for these different causes of your problem.  Take care,   Apurva\n\n",

Where can I find the answer of the cause of my wife illness? Very truly yours, Phuoc Ngo\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 42 year old, female, difficult breathing, fainting",
    "content": "Hello, Fainting is the result of momentary decrease in blood supply to the brain.  It can be associated with low blood pressure.  Other causes include dehydration, getting up too fast, breathing too fast, working or playing hard, getting very upset, being queasy over something upsetting such as the sight of blood, the result of medication side effects  (especially if taking blood pressure medication), a drop in blood sugar (as with diabetics).  In many cases it is of no real concern except safety from falls and injury.    But it could also be indicative of a more serious underlying disorder.  Whenever you lose consciousness it is a good idea to have it checked out with a doctor.  Where she has had multiple episodes, I think it is important to find out why - especially if she has any other symptoms along with it (shortness of breath, irregular heart beat, pregnancy, confusion, speech difficulty, chest pain, confusion, taking longer than a few seconds to arouse, shortness of breath).  If your wife feels she is about to faint, she should try to lie down.  If this is not possible, she should sit bent over forward with her head low between her knees.  She should not get up quickly but should wait until she feels better to ease her way up again.  Be sure she is well-hydrated.  Best wishes to you and your family.\n\n",

Pleurisy is due to an inflamed area of the lining of the lungs and chest wall (the pleura).  It classically causes pain with deep breathing.  Heart pain is often more vague pain that is a bit hard to pinpoint.  It really is not affected by deep breathing.  Pleurisy can be treated by using anti-inflammatory medicines.  If the pain does not improve in the next day or so I would advise her to see her doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Also get shortness of breath. Also have been itching all over my body, sometimes wakes me up at night and will scratch intensly. None of this bothers me when i am laying down and sleeping at night. I will get fatigued easily like when walking around a mall for an hour, but after resting will get a second wind. Ive felt like this for awhile now and sometimes it bothers me and other times its not as apparent. last doctor wanted to prescribe low dose of prozak. Blood pressure when at doctors is usually 140/90 or higher but when i self test is usually never higher than 130/80 and most of the time lower.   thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Chest pain is a symptom which worries most people when they get it. It has some connotations to the heart disease. It is very important to clear any misconceptions about this symptom.  Chest pain occurring on walking and subsiding on rest could be a heart pain. Especially if the pain involves the left shoulder and left arm. Shortness of breath on walking also has similar relation to heart disease. If you have this type of pain you must try to get to the bottom of it and report this to your doctor. Having said that, low hemoglobin can give you symptoms that exactly mimic a heart pain. So it would be wise to get a Hemoglobin check done first.   One doctor told you mild mitral valve but mitral valve what? Mitral valve prolapse, mitral valve stenosis, mitral valve regurgutation? All are different things. Mitral valve is a heart structure which is just there. If it is mitral valve prolpase, it is an innocent condition, can give you chest pains, panic attacks are also associated with it.   My advice, do not panic, check the hemoglobin, get in touch with an internist first who will have a broader vision, and follow her advice.  Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "So I am just wondering what the dangers/effects are for a person who has heart palpitations for unknown reasons (no abnormal arythmia)taking a stimulant like Vivance. This person is currently a 22 year old athletic, non smoking grad student and has been told to cut back on caffine and stress since 16 but has still had heart palpitations off and on. Rarely, these have caused dizziness and loss of conciousness. She has also had a only a few anxiety attacks but does not consider herself to be an anxious person. These anxiety attacks seem to be caused by the combination of energy drinks and lack of sleep. Around 18 and 19 she was diagnosed with depression but did not like any of the anti depressants or mood stabalizers so she is not currently taking any of those. Due to some sad family news she has had a very difficult time concentrating on her studies and is considering taking an attention improving drug. While I know drugs like Vivance require an adhd diagnosis and then a prescription, these drugs are easily obtainable without this (especially on college campuses) and I would like to know some information on the possible effects this drug can have on 1. someone who does not have adhd and could be stimulated by it. 2. Someone who has a history of heart palpitations and 3. Could have both anxiety and depression. Any Help would be greatly appreciated\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Effects of stimulants on heart palpitations",
    "content": "Hi txmaya,  Your friend is treading on a dangerous path. Taking Dextroamphetamine without a diagnosis and a prescription is not advisable as the drug has addiction liability.   Your friend is having palpitations. Palpitation is caused by either forceful thumping of heart or due to irregular fast or slow heart rate. Anxiety can cause palpitation. Stress can cause palpitation. Caffeine can cause palpitation. Stress can cause palpitation. Energy drinks contain ingredients that can cause palpitation. Lack of adequate sleep can cause palpitation. Plus Vyvance induces lack of sleep!! So how many more reasons does your friend need to have palpitations?  Eight hours of sleep is one of the basic necessity in human physiology as important as eating and breathing. Sleep induces secretions of some hormones from hypothalamus of the brain which go a long way to improve the immune system of the body. Good sleep also helps improve concentration and betters intellectual performance.   If your friend has some sad family situation, she may well get a prescription of sertraline [daxid] or fluoxetine to tide her over. But I strongly advice her against taking stimulants without medical supervision.  Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am 34 years old.  I am 5' 2\" and 115 lbs.  For the past year, I have had pain in my left, upper chest on and off.  I have seen 2 doctors at the practice I go to, and 1 surgeon.  I have had a chest x-ray and an ekg (both around the middle of last year).  I have been told it could be breast pain, heart burn or simply anxiety.  I tried taking something for heart burn but that didnt' work.  The surgeon thought it was breast pain and told me to take Evening Primrose Oil, but that didn't help either.  The feeling is like a burning sensation just below my skin, with occasional sharp pain, above my breast and towards the center of my chest.  Occasionally, I will also have a dull pain in my left armpit.  Rarely, the pain is dull and I can feel it in the entire left side of my chest. I also have asthema, but usually only when I have a cold.  Recently the asthema has come back, but only with a slight cough, no cold.  The other morning it was hard to breath.  I am going to go to the doctor for the asthma soon.  I don't think it is related, though. The only other symptom that seems to occasionally happen with the chest discomfort is a sharp pain in the upper left part of my back.  The doctor did say it may be a pinched nerve in my back.\n\n",

Sometimes it is radiated the left arm, left shoulder, or even base of neck and jaw.  Musculo-skeletal pain is sharp, localized, increases in movement, cough or breathing. Does not have relation to exercise. Pleuritic pain is also similar.  Looking to your pain, however I do agree with your doctor that this just could be a pinched nerve in your spine causing chest pain infront in iys area od distribution.\n\n",

I have had a stabbing chest pain, which comes just left of the manubrium and the body of the sternum right between rib 1 and 2 in the 2nd intercostal space (I am getting the exact locations from an anatomy textbook).  I mentioned this pain to my GP, which was accompanied by lightheadedness and sometimes faintness.  He proscribed a stress test and 48 hour halter monitor.  Nothing was remarkable about either test, and nothing was noted with the halter monitor as correlated with symptoms.  However, recently I noticed while evacuating  a bowel movement and some strain from that, I was able to illicit the stabbing pain.  What was most notable about this was that I got the pain 2 to 3 seconds after straining.  I can also illicit this with deep inspiration of air with the same delay of time.  Does this sound significant to you?  Am I in danger of having a vessel rupture?  I lost my job and I can't afford to go to a doctor right now.  So any input would be appreciated if you think I am in danger of an impending problem not caught in my cardiac tests.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Chest pain is common symptom. Association of this location of pain with Heart is the cause of a lot of anxiety on the part of one who suffers from it. However it is equally true that many of the chest pains are never related to the heart. Especially the location you describe is not characteristic of a heart pain. Classic angina or heart pain is typically retro sternal, choking or squeezing sensation, poorly localized, comes on or aggravated by exertion, sometimes radiating to the left arm, neck and jaw.  Non cardiac or musculoskeletal pain is typically well localized, as in your case, aggravated by deep breathing, or coughing.   The delay which you describe is not correlating to any of the classic symptom complexes of various kind of chest pains. However my advice to you, is to not panic at all. In my opinion this pain does not look like a heart pain. Since you do not have insurance, what you can do is go and buy an OTC pain relieving tablets along with an antacid and anti gas formulation. And most important TRY not to think of it and divert your mind with some constructive activity. Stop reading anatomy text books! [lol].   Take care,  Apurva.   N.B.

    "content": "Hi,  Coronary artery disease interferes with Heart physiology in two distinct ways. One, it causes impairment of blood supply to the heart muscle due to blockages and cause ischemia leading to Anginal pain or heart attack. Second, It can cause \u2018necrosis\u2019 or death of part of the heart muscle leading to reduction in pumping power [\u2018Ejection Fraction\u2019 or EF]of the heart. This can lead to shortness of breath [SOB].  After 11 caths and 2 palsties, you get chest pain on exertion and dyspnea on effort so much so that you have to be bathed. This suggests two things. Either you are still having severe ischemia or second- and more likely- you are having a low ejection fraction. I am sure you must have undergone an Echocardiogram and this will she what Ejection Fraction you have. If it is below 30 % it can be the reason for your shortness of breath. The fact that you have BP sometime of 60/30 and you have to be hospitalized to keep it up probably indicates a low EF.  You say you have a pulse of 32-40. If really so, metoprolol needs to be curtailed in a gradual manner after consultation with your cardiologist.  From your profile I see that you have been a smoker and you have a COPD which is also a cause for your SOB.   I hope I have been helpful.   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 29 year old female born with Tetralogy Fallot - which was surgically corrected at the age of 10.  I have not had any further surgery and am still missing a pulmonary valve.  I am healthy and quite fit and play competitve sport.  It is rare that I get sick or get the flu.  I am not on any type of medication and irregularly take a few general vitamins.  I did go on Yasmin 3 years ago for approximately 6 months and felt so awful during that time that I stopped taking it.  I have in the last 3 years been getting sharp pain in my left chest (only lasts a few seconds) that takes my breath away but then a minute later I am okay and just a little shaken for it.  I tend to have a touch soreness/tenderness to the side of and on the side of my left breast for a day or two afterwards though.  I may go for 6 months without any of these sharp pains and then over a few weeks, will get a number of them.  I feel scared to breath deeply after one.  Just this morning I had one while I was just sitting on the bus and then a few seconds later had a second more intense one which was unusual.  I don't experience dizziness or shortness of breath.  I am starting to think that they might be more likely to occur when I am under particular work or personal pressure and a more hectic fitness program.  Due to my missing of the pulmonary valve, I have begun MRI scans every 12 months for the last 3 years and I have been told that while my heart is enlarged, there has been no sign of any further deterioration over that time period.    I have mentioned the above to my heart specialist who is a lovely man but he did not have any suggestions as to what was happening.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Gordina,  Tetralogy of Fellot's is a complex cyanotic congenital heart diease, fatal if goes uncorrected. And mind well, correction is never easy. Each case is having some variable anatomy and it requires some high skill levels and vast experience on the part of the surgeon to accomplish a successful correction. The fact that at the age of 29 you are healthy and indulge in competitive sports indicates a very successful surgery.  The pain type you are describing however does not correlate with any known causes and conditions. It is not cardiac, not muscular, and neither pleuritic. I feel this could have something to do with an episode of dyspepsia or flatulence and the reason of sharp stabbing pain the movement of gas in the tranverse colon or jejunum.   You could try some OTC anti flatulents at such a time. If you do not find relief I think a consultation with an internist would be helpful.   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Heavines in left arm is associated with several reasons. First and foremost is the heart condition- Angina where along with the chest pain one aalso may get pain or heaviness in the left arm. Your father however had a problem in mitral valve, a Mitral Prolapse which has nothing to do with the disease causing Angina and couldn't be related.  Another reason is some nerve root compression at the spinal cord level. This will create heaviness, pain or numbness all along the distribution route of the nerve.  The possibility described by your hospital doctors is also absolutely valid, and if so the symptom will get relived in a few days' time.  Meanwhile, I do not see any reason for worry or panic on this ground, only some muscle relaxants plus some analgesics, which in any case he would be receiving after the surgery will control the symptom.

    "content": "Hello. I am a 21 year old non smoking male. I have had Generalized Anxiety Disorder for over a year and a half and also have panic disorder. After my first panic attack i have worried excessively about my heart, thinking its going to give out any second and I will die suddenly. This has ruined my life but i am making tremendous strides in managing my anxiety with therapy and Xanax taken daily in low doses .25 MG.   The probelm is, i am obsessed with my heart, my blood pressure, what i eat and so forth becuase I am so afraid something bad will happen to it. So i would like to know what you think about my chances are rationally since you are the doctor.  I have been active my entire life in sports. Football, Basketball, Track, Cross Country and Soccer. I have never felt faint or dizzy or sick playing these sports. My blood pressure average is around 115/75. My cholesterol levels are good its 185 total my HDL is 60 my LDL is a little higher than I would like at 116 and triglycerides are 50. I have never smoked or drank, ever or taken any kind of drug. I drink one cup of coffee maybe 3-4 times a week. I have had 2 EKG's which the doctor said looked \"excellent\", i have had two physicals in the past year, both times the doctor said that my heart sounded very strong and normal, no murmur or anything. There is no history of heart disease in my family except my grandfather died at 55 of a heart attack but he was a heavy drinker and smoker and did not control his diabetes. My dad is diabetic and had high BP and cholesterol but that was due to his diabetes all his numbers are in control now from what his doctor said. My mom had no history of heart problems on her side of the family. Most people in my family have lived well into their 70's and 80's. My anxiety has just got me thinking im going to break tradition and die any day now suddenly of some heart problem. I am also terrified to play sports that i used to play because I am afraid i might die. What are the chances that will happen given my history? MY heart rate exercising is around 120-140. Can a healthy heart handle that? For how long?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello greenstone312,  From the information you provided, I can confidently say that you are very unlikely to experience any serious cardiac event.  It sounds as though you are in excellent physical health.  This is the most rational answer I can give you--but I think you recognize that the level of anxiety you are experiencing is irrational and unfortunately I think that this reassurance is unlikely to eliminate any of that anxiety.  My concern from your post is for your mental health.  You mention that you feel that your symptoms have improved with therapy, but you are currently describing severe anxiety symptoms that clearly cause impairment in your functioning.  I am sorry to hear that you are unable to participate in sports currently because of the severity of your symptoms.  Anxiety is physically and mentally exhausting.  There are many effective treatments available, it just sounds like your current regimen is not providing adequate relief.  SSRIs and some of the mixed-neurotransmitter antidepressants can be very effective in treating anxiety, panic, and obsessive symptoms.  Please talk to your doctor about what medications will help control your symptoms better.  In the meantime, you might eliminate those 3-4 cups of coffee a week.  That's not a lot, but caffeine can exacerbate anxiety and some people are more sensitive than others.  I hope you will find a treatment that works for you soon, and can return to doing the physical activities you enjoy.  Exercise will help keep your heart healthy for years to come and is also very beneficial for your mental health.  Please believe that your life is not ruined.  I know that you are suffering a great deal right now, but your condition is treatable.  There is no reason to think that you will not overcome this.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 42 year old obese male that has been diagnosed with diabetes in Dec 2007 and hypertension 2 years prior. I used to smoke for 20+ years but quit almost 3 years ago.  Approx 12 years ago(was normal weight and no medical conditions) I started to get chest pains on the left side front of chest on a regular basis. Family doctor at that time sent me for stress test and halter monitor...All was normal..thought to be muscle related. Pain continued for another 2 years and got worse..Doctor then sent for another halter monitor and nuclear stress test....was told all was normal...Pain dissappeared for almost 2 years. Moved to another city and started seeing another doctor...Chest pain started again however this was more of a burning and instead of being on the front of chest it was about 6 inches under the left armpit at the side of chest.  Would seem to get worse with excercise or stress. Sent for more stress test and halter..told all normal. Continued to just live with pain and thought it was muscular....It got worse again and went to ER. They ran ekg and chest xray told all was normal....Pain still continued. Doctor sent me to a cardioligist who did another stress test and told me all was normal but to stop smoking(which I did) and to loose weight (which I did not). He was actually surprised at how long I could go on the tread mill. He said for my size I was in good shape. One day while sitting waiting for the family doctor I looked through my file and on top was report from cardiologist it mentioned LVH. I asked the family doctor about this and she said it was nothing to worry about..looked it up on the net and it did not sound too good.  3 years ago while a nurse in the hospital was doing pre-op for surgery to have 1/2 my thyroid removed(nodule - turned out to be not cancer) she was doing and EKG and asked if I had ever had a heart attack. I told her not that I was aware of. They called up the cardiologist I had seen and compared with previos EKG. There was a difference. They did a Echo before the surgery to make sure everything was OK. Tech said all was fine but had a hard time seeing with the amount of fat at my side under arm. About 6 months later started having more of the same pain in Side(severe) went to ER.  EKG was abnormal but same as one previous to thyroid surgery...said that even though EKG did show a previous MI that they believed it was not true. Scheduled me to come back for Stress Test. Had stress test students were training at the same time so they did an echo right after I got off the tread mill. On tread mill the cardioligist noticed the slight abnormally in EKG but said it was nothing and I needed ot excercise more. Echo did not show much as too much body fat.  I have been afraid to excercise as my chest hurts so much I think I am going to die of a heart attack  Decided I wanted to go back and see original cardiologist that the doctor sent me too. He looked at the new EKG and said although it had changed since he did it originally it was nothng to worry about.....Checked BP and with the altace it was within normal range LDL is great HDL is low.  that was about 2 years ago...The pain continues however the other night something different happend. Normally when I get up in the morning I have no Pain until I have been awake for about 2 hours....I was sleeping the other night and was awoke 2 times with crushing pain in the middle of my chest. It lasted for about a minute each time. Since then pain under arm(6 inches down has been worse)  I hate to keep going back and keep being told it is nothing..what about this LVH stuff  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Chest pain occurring on exertion is more likely from the heart rather than occurring randomly. From your history one thing is clear that you have been having chest pains for 12 years without a clear diagnosis as to the cause. You have been subjected to stress tests which have been normal. However every test has a limited power of diagnosis and a certain  percentage of abnormality may go un-detected.   Over a period of years your EKG went from normal to doubtful/abnormal. meanwhile Diabetes is detected last December, one does not know since when it has been there. You have LVH. Its Left Ventricular Hypertrophy meaning the thickness of your heart mucscle has increased beyound the normal range. This happens when your Ventricle is pumping the blood against a high resistance, in your case your High BP. Your HDL is low [which should be higher the better]. You have been smoking for 20 years. You have a family history of heart disease [father]. You are overweight.   So in medical parlance you have many 'Risk Factors' for  development of blockages in your heart arteries, in addition you are having chest pains and crushing ones lately. In addition diabetes is such a disease that could result in your kind of situation that is a series of EKGs would be normal and one day a doctor would find the EKG shows a previous or a current heart attack.   Internet is a medium wherein one can only opine from the information provided, there is no way for the professional to check things for himself. However from the data presented, as a medical professional I would opine that you have a battery of risk factors operating in your system, you have been having frequent severe chest pains, your EKG shows doubtful changes and has changed over a period of time. You are in my opinion a kind of candidate who would need a further coronary work up to get to the root of the matter, especially since your Echo and stress tests are not giving much information due to the limitations of the tests, and due to the obesity.  Take care,   Apurva\n\n",

    "title": "Hypotension, bradycardia, Atrial fibrillations and syncope",
    "content": "I am female, 37 years old, 173cm and 88kg. I\u00b4m healty and fit, do cardiovascular exercise 2-3 times weekly, normal diet. I\u00b4m a government official and have an office job with some travelling.  A few years ago (4 years ago first time, 2 years ago last time), I experienced atrial fibrillation on 4 occations, observed in the ER and leading to hospitalization and further tests. All 4 times they ended by themselves. It was observed at the hospital and a following 24h Holter-monitoring that I have extrasystoles most of the time at rest, but it was explained that this is fairly normal, and not dangerous. Absolutely nothing was found wrong with me - I was found to be in excellent health and fit, normal bloodpressure, very healthy cholesterol etc.  The reason for the atrial fibrillation was deemed to be stress.  Since this (2 years ago until 1 year ago) I\u00b4ve fainted or near-fainted on several occations. Once during exercise, once walking on the street, once having lunch, once reading a newspaper at work. My previous history led to re-testing, and again I was found to be in excellent health, but the same story with the extrasystoles. I went through 24h Holter-registration, a one-week registration carrying a monitoring device, echo, stress-test without any findings. But it has been observed that my resting pulse is low (between 30 and 40), my blood pressure varies between low (eg. 85/48) and normal. I have not done any long term monitoring of blood pressurse, btw. I\u00b4ve been to the cardiology dept of two different hospitals to do these tests. Again, stress was deemed to be the reason.   Last year, I was hospitalised with severe chest pains and checked out for embolisms in my heart and lungs. Again, nothing was found wrong through 3 days of hospitalization and testing, except indications that I had some kind of virus. I was told the symptoms and tests indicated a possible virus on the lung sack. My low blood pressure, slow resting pulse and extra systoles were again pointed out to me.  A a result of these incidences, I reduced my work hours to 6 per day, and try to make sure to get 6-7 hours of sleep per night.  I make sure to eat right, and to get enough salt and water. I exercise, and walk/stay active whenever possible. I have never smoked, and only drink on rare occations. I drink 3-4 cups of coffee per week, I have a handicapped son, and this takes quite some effort on the home front.  To bring a long question to end: Since last summer, all has been well. The last two months I\u00b4ve noticed more of the extrasystoles, normally a sign that my stress-level is increasing. Today, while painting a wall in our house, I must have fainted - as I woke up on the floor. I was standing while painting - no changes in posture. I don\u00b4t know how long I was passed out, but on previous occations it has been only minutes, followed by drowsiness. When I woke up, I was extremly drowsy, and a bit heavy if breath. My husband took my blood pressure - for the next half hour it varied between 85/55-ish to 122/100-ish, and finally stabilised at 115/65-ish. My heart rate ranged from 32 with the low blood pressure and up to 100 with the high blood pressure, and it has stayed between 90-100 since - that\u00b4s higher than normal for me. After about half an hour I was more or less back to myself, but very tired. I\u00b4ve been eating and drinking normally today, and have used the same paint before without any problems.  I didn\u00b4t want to contact my primary doctor on this occasion, because he seems to think I have stress induced panic attacks when I experience these episodes, since nothing is wrong with me. The fact that there is no panic, fear, or awareness of any attack at all does not seem to faze him.  The hospital feedback is not in this direction - rather it has been indicated to me that this is almost certainly not a reason for what happens. I also don\u00b4t want to contact the ER, since they always tend to send me to the hospital in an ambulance just to make sure. Since I\u00b4ve done all the tests before and anyhow feel better now than earlier today, that seems a bit of an overkill, right now.   Is there anything that could explain what my heart is doing and why? Do I need to get checked out again, or should I just note it down to all is well, but I need to stress down? Any advice?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Atrial fibrillation [AF] by itself is a serious arrhythmia. Low pulse of 30-35 [as you say it is] is also something to worry about.   AF has several causes. Rheumatic valve disease, hyperthyroidism, Coronary heart disease, degenerative heart disease etc. However it is more common in females and sometimes none of the above causes can be found. In this case it is termed 'Lone Atrial Fibrillation' and the cause is attributed to stress or sympathetic overactivation.  The fact that you passed out while painting the wall suggests that you have a problem maintaining good Blood pressure in the upright position. With your frequent drop beats, history of AF and this I am of the opinion that a consultation with a cadiologist with a Tilt Table test and electrophysiologic study is necessary. Holter is commonly normal even though there is an abnormality and its diagnostic yield is very poor.  I hope this is useful to you,   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  While exercising one allows the heart rate to race up to 220-age. For you this would mean 193. Crossing this limit is not harmful, but then the exercise becomes anaerobic and the body gains in muscle strenght more.   However sudden jump to a rate of 218 or 211 is something to think about. One reason could be your recovery phase from an infection. Post viral infection asthenia is a known condition and could lead to faster heart rates when exercising.   Another possibility to keep in mind is Atrail tachycardia or Supraventricular tachtcardia [SVT]. Especially so since it goes to this level suddenly.   A consultation with a cardiologist to rule this out would be in order in my opinion.   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rebecca,  At 28, you are quite young to have a heart condition, unless you have one from birth [congenital] or childhood [rheumatic]. I am sure you do not have neither of these two.  Bulimia is not as likely to cause heart failure and cardiac death as anorexia. Those who take frequent purgation and induce vomits, may suffer low potassium levels and sudden cardiac death. Excess nutrition from bulimia may have caused hypercholesterolemia etc but now that you are out of it there is no imminent threat.  As for chest pain, any pain that increases on coughing, sneezing, turning, or deep breathing generally is not from the heart. This could either be a muscular pain or pain from the lung memrane called pleura.   If the pain is very consistent is may be worthwhile to check with your doctor if some chest x ray is required.  But stop worrying about heart failure at your age!   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Trinity,  Heart attack is a clinical manifestation of a process called atherosclerosis in which the inner lining of the blood vessels get fat deposition followed by caicium and they become a plaque. Gradually this plaque increases in size and obstructs the lumen of the vessel causing angina, and when it clogs the vessel totally, it is a heart attack.  This process of atherosclerosis takes many years to progress and usually symptoms of angina or heart attack are not seen in young individulas like you. Moreover females are especially spared of this predicament until menopause because estrogen hormone in them seems to impart protection from atherosclerosis.   Over and above, the description of the pain you give also is not characteristic of a heart pain. So rest assured, you are not having  a heart  attack. This should relieve you of much of the anxiety and that in inself will go a long way to subside your symptoms.   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. My wife is a healthy 24 year old with no prior medical history. About 3 years ago she began to occasionally have a squeezing in her chest. She describes it like someone put their hands over her heart and squeezed on it. These episodes were very short (around 1 second) and occurred periodically (once or twice a month). They were also random in that no particulare activity led to an episode. She finally went to her primary care physician who checked her out and gave her an EKG, all of which he said looked normal and he didn't seem too concerned. For the next 2 years she had no more episodes but then yesterday she had another one, exactly like the ones in the past.  It lasted about a second and felt like someone was squeezing her heart. She is not worried about it but I am a little nervous since it may be involving her heart. Any MD advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Periodic squeezing pain in chest",
    "content": "Hi,  Chest pain is a symptom which scares the most and its quite netural that you are a bit concerned.   Squeezing type of chest pain can be either an Angina- [a situation where the heart is not receiving enough blood due to some artery narrowing]. Or it can be a heart attack where the concerned heart artery gets totally blocked.   Sqeueezing in chest can also be due to a Bronchospasm commonly occuring in Asthama or chronic bronchitis.  On the other hand squeezing pain in chest can be the symptom of what is called an Esophageal Spasm- some irritation in the lining of the food pipe, commonly caused by regurgitation of acid from the stomach.   In young females-like in your wife- the possibility of an angina or a heart attack are fairly remote, as this type of heart disease is vary rare in young menstuating females. Then you say there has been no past history, so presumong no history of asthma and bronchitis, the only likely reason is probably the acid reflux.  However I do urge you to get in touch with your doctor and get necessary tests done for this symptom.  Bye,  Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Your left hand feels colder than right but you haven't said if its your left or right foot that you are unable to lift. For the purpose of this discussion I presume it to be the left.  Unable to lift the foot or 'Foot Drop' is most commonly caused by injury or compression to the leg nerve called ' Lateral Peroneal Nerve' This is mostly reversibe-unless it is a grave injury- and recovers in a few days time.  Another common reason for such weak foot is uncontrolled or undetected Diabetes Mellitus which will cause the nerve dysfunction and foot drop.   Compression at the cord level can be the reason for your kind of symptoms where both the left arm and hand which feels cold and the foot which drops. here the causative factor is some disk disease at both the levels.  You may get in touch with your doctor and she will advise you the necessary tests to undergo to arrive at the correct diagnosis.  Apurva\n\n",

For the past two 1/2 months, however, i have been getting severe light heads. For a day or two they may subside but then come back again realy bad and are very scary. I feel as if i am on the point of passing out. In the past three weeks, however, these light heads have been accompanied by very uncomfortable chest pains, mostly on the left side, upper chamber near the shoulder but also someimes in the centre of my chest.  I have had a CT brain scan, an x-ray, ECG, Echo and all blood tests carried out and these have all come back clear thankfully. I am convinced there is something wrong though. Could it simply be anxiety? I am taking stemitel (prochlorperazine) to ease the dizziness but it doesn't really work. My doctor is unsure as to what it may be and so is sending me to a cardiologist for a further stress test. It is so unsettling, scary and i am apprehensive before going anywhere or doing anything.  Has anyone else had similar symptoms or can anyone help me please?   cormac - ireland\n\n",

Hypotension [Low Blood Pressure] Postural Hypotension [Low blood pressure in standing position] Mitral Valve prolapse syndrome Benign positional vertigo Low hemoglobin  etc  If the lightness comes on only after standing up, it is possibly postural hypotension. If the lightness comes on after turning your head or turning in bed, it could be Positional vertigo, an inner ear condition. Mitral prolapse is a condition seen by Echo and where one of the heart valves is long. This is many times associated with chest pain and dizziness. Low hemoglobin will cause dizziness and darkening of vision on sudden standing up.  If all your work up is normal as you say you probably are a little sensitized to the matter and anxious.  However I advise you to get all the test advised by your doctor.   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 57 year-old male, retired, remain active with yard work and around the house, but can't seem to lose tummy fat that's hardly visible except when unclothed. My height is 5' 8\", weight 163. More so since getting into my fifties, I eat very little red meat, consume almost no fats or dairy or wheat, eat a lot of vegetables, fish, lean chicken, Ezekiel bread and lots of green tea, have about 8 ozs. of red wine nightly and take a lot of supplements (fish oil, COQ10, Acetyl-L-Cartinine, ZMA, B12, and multi vitamins). I do 50 to 70 push-ups each morning and sometimes another 50 at day's end. I also lift some weights, working with about 60 pounds, for about 10 minutes four or five days a week. My blood pressure is usually 105/68 to 115/75 at home and 120/80 in the doctor's office. My resting pulse rate when I awake is usually in the 60s but in the 70s to 90s during the day. Fasting blood sugar is usually about 78 to 94. Low testosterone of 247 required my being on Testim 1% for the past 4 months. PSA now is 4.2, due to being on TRT andmt urlogist has recommended no more TEstim 1% as of one week ago. Digital prostate exam at the same time was ok. I have a total cholesterol of 232, HDL 47, LDL 174. Those numbers have improved from 285/38/185 over the past 9 months. I have noticed that my legs occasionally feel sickeningly weak at the knees. Determining to \"fight\" this, I started light jogging four days ago - 10 minutes in the morning and again in the evening - and find that when I return home, my blood pressure is about 130/80 then falls to my normal levels, sometimes even down to 100/60 in less five minutes. My heartrate, though, becomes \"normal\" more slowly, lowering from about 120 down to 115 in two or three minutes, then slowly to around 90 after five minutes. I have read that after this kind of exercise, one's heart rate should drop about 10 to 20 points in one minute. A stress test last March returned good recovery results, according to my doctor. I'm sure that I am slightly out of shape but feel concerned about this slow heartrate recovery. Would this recovery rate improve the more and the longer I exercise? Sorry to be so long-winded. I just want to keep my health functioning and be around a long time for my wonderful wife of 27 years. Thanks in advance for your response. ----  dwellnear@yahoo.com.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I must congratulate you that you are a very health oriented person and you do have some very nice habits of diet and exercise. The stuff you eat daily is one of the healthiest kind. Red wine is good too for the heart and 240 ml a day is well within the accepted range.   Push ups and weights fall into the category of Isometric exercise. In hypertensive and cardiac patients it is not recommended but as you have no cardiac history and your blood pressure in in the normal to low normal range it is okay for you. But its good that lately you have added some aerobics into your routine.  The heart rate recovery you are worried about is because of some lack of conditioning, since you are not habituated to aerobics. As you keep doing it, gradually the heart rate rise will be less and recovery will be faster.  However I am not too happy about your lipid levels. LDL is the real culprit and needs to be in the range below 130 in a non cardiac person as per National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP] guidelines.Kindly check with your physician if he wants to do something about it.  Happy running!   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Murphy,  Chest pain on left side with pain in left arm has several reasons. Of course the most serious of them is angina or heart pain when heart is deprived of enough blood supply. However this is not constant like you have it for 2 years. Heart pain generally comes on after some exertion and subsides on rest.   Another possibility is a muscle or bone pain from the chest wall. This could be constant. Since you have it for 2 years, one must entertain a possibility of some spondylosis in the cervical vertebrae which could compress the spinal nerve root and cause a pain in front chest wall and arm.  However one must be certain and you definitely need to rule out heart issue by futher tests like Echo and stress test if your phisician deems it fit.   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hey there,  I'm a 20 yr old female with a history of SVT. I had an ablation in 2002. Since then I've had the occassional episode but they usually only last a few minutes. I get shortness of breath, especially in the shower. I've had a few echocardiograms (due to SVT;normal) and many ECG's. My HR is usually above 100 and my nursing instructors suggested I get tested for hyperthyroidism.   I scheduled an appointment and when they were taking my vitals my HR was 170bpm. It didn't feel fast, I wasn't uncomfortable, and I hadn't had any caffeine or other stimulents. The doctor wanted to call an ambulence (which I refused) and they suggested that I go to the ER which I did. Oh, and the thyroid test came back normal.  At the ER my HR was 165 and they gave me two injections of adenosine which didn't work and a shot of something else which returned my HR to normal. The whole time I felt completely normal. I wasn't lightheaded, short of breath, or anything.  The ECG said that I was having sinus tach with a nonspecific repol abnormality, diffuse leads. What does this mean?  Also, in the right side of my neck there is a high-pitched whooshing sound that can be heard with a stethescope...is this normal? Also, sometimes I feel pressure directly over the middle of my sternum  I'm suppose to see my cardiologist next week but don't really want to go...  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: SVT; ablation; new symptoms",
    "content": "Hi earthchild,  Reasons for fast heart rate are many.  Fever Anxiety Pregnancy Hyperthyroidism Heart Failure [weak pumping] SVT Atrial Fibrillation Ventricular tachycardia AV malformation with shunt [AVM]  You had an SVT to start with. SVT will have fast heart rate but it is never a sinus tachycardia. This time when your heart rate was 170 you say you had Sinus Tachycardia which means it was not SVT and the heart was beating fast with its normal beating mechanism. This is often associated with non specific repolarisation abnormality which is of no significance.   So now that it is not SVT, things like fever, anxiety, prgnancy, hyperthyroidism, and AVM need to be ruled out.  The swooshing sound in neck on stethoscope just COULD be a continuous to and fro murmur of an AV malformation. On the other hand it could be a carotid bruit, caused due to a plaque in your carotid artery but at your age it is less likely.  Best thing to do is to see your cardiologist and if everything ok with the ablation part, get a work up done to rule out the other possibilitis I just mentioned.  Do not get anxious, this does not look to be too serious!   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 30 year old female.  Ever since I can remember I have had a slow heart rate (48-58) and heart murmur.  I was never any good at sports because I would get tired really quick.  When I was about 14 or 15 I had an EKG and an ultrasound done on my heart.  I don't really remember a lot of what I was told but I think I was told that I had a misshaped left ventrical and that someday I might need a pacemaker.  I've always had some pulpitations and some chest pain here and there.   Over the last year I have noticed that I have been getting light headed when I stand up.  On several occasions I've felt as if I was going to pass out and everything gets foggy looking for a few seconds usually.  I've had a few times where it lasted for a few minutes and I felt confused (a little) when I was walking.  Sometimes I feel like I have vertigo and get dizzy when I wake up or tilt my head.  This seems to be happening more and more over time.  I guess my question is could this be early signs of heart problems and if I should seek a specialist (I have no insurance).  I just feel like something is not right with me, but don't know if I may just be overacting in this situation.  I also didn't mention that I have PCOS, normal blood pressure, and smoke about a pack a day of cigarettes. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank You\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would definitely have this checked out when you can.  Since you have a known heart problem you should have follow up care, especially since you are symptomatic.  Are there any clinics in your area with a sliding fee schedule?    Meanwhile, I'm sure you know you are asking for trouble as a smoker.  Please get help quitting.  I understand it is addiction and one of the hardest substances to stop using but there is help available and thousands have been successful.  Call your local health department or tobacco quit line.  You must do this!    If the PCOS is not treated and/or you are overweight, this is another area you can affect if you are determined.  Even mild weight loss can make a difference if this is a problem for you.  There is diet information available online and many low-cost support programs are available.  For both of these risk factors you might contact the American Heart Association, visit the website, etc.    I know how restricting lack of health insurance can be but you might consider the money you have not been paying in premiums is used to pay for your care and sometimes it actually comes out to be less than your premiums might have cost you if you did have insurance.  Keep a health savings account so you can get the care you need somehow.  You can start with the money you save on cigarettes if you quit.  Good luck.\n\n",

In addition i'm experiencing, shortness of breath, dizziness, cold/hot chills, disconnected/dreamlike feelings. All these other things seem to be brought on by panic over the chest tightness. Also, when i drink anything I seem to get a burning sensation in my chest on the left side and experience a bit of nausea. I haven't been to a doctor yet as I have no insurance. But at the end of this month I'm getting insurance through work. Was just hoping to have some idea what this could be. thanks...\n\n",

    "content": "I am 21 and had a similar problem that started about a year. I was given medication for Asthma and an inhaler. I am a smoker and that along with lack of exercise can contribute to that (shortness of breath),  Also if your over weight. And the feelings that you get the \"dizziness, cold/hot chills, disconnected/dreamlike feelings\" are likely from anxiety about the overall problem. But I am not a doctor. I have had similar problem though.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Tightness in the chest is a classic symptom of heart disease, specifically coronary insufficiency which means less blood supply to the heart muscle. Especially so since you have shortness of breath too. But does this come on at the time of some physical exertion? Try to notice if it does.  However burning sensation while drinking is indicative of some inflammation of the food pipe-esophagus- most commonly because of acid reflux from the stomach. This could also lead to tightness in chest.  You must get in touch with your doctor soon and undergo examination and tests like EKG, Stress test, Echocardiogram and possibly an upper GI endoscopy as well.  I hope this is useful,   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "I am 37 yo fe with labile hypertension, tachycardia for about 5 years.  Current heart rate -70s thru 120, BP 116/78 thru 210/120, constant fluctuation, not matching activity/stress.  Felt worse last summer: heart pounding, dizzy spells, shaky, nervous, insomnia, headaches, fatigue. I was put on 25mg Toporol XL, it didn't help much.  I got really dizzy and almost passed out at work mid Jan. 07, my family doctor's impression: poss arrhythmia, PSVT, pheochromocytoma?  Toporol increased 50mg/day.  Since then, I have daily flushing of cheeks, nose, under chin, anorexia, feeling hot, heavy perspiring, periods of extreme thirst and frequent urination, slight nose bleeds.    On Feb. 7 I had a grand-mal seizure at work, sitting in my chair, witnessed by RN coworkers. It lasted 2.5 minutes, I was blue and not breathing during seizure nor afterwards until I got a rescue breath.  Brought by ambulance to ER.  Labs values flagged as abnormal were: CO2 -14, Creatinin 1.3, RBC 5.88, HGB 16.8, HCT 50.3, RDW 14.7, Platelet 462, Monocyte 1.1.  Brain CT normal, chest x-ray show heart and lungs normal.  Impression: ortho hypotension, dehydration, UTI.  Dehydration didn't make sense with the amount of water I always drink.  Now I have constant \"waves\" dizziness, nausea, increased weight loss, more facial hair growth, feel disoriented, loss for words, overall discomfort, especially trunk, leg cramps.  I've started baby ASA daily to help thin my blood.  Where do I go from here?  Family doc, cardiologist, endocrinologist or will it get better by itself?  Can this be a sign of something life threatening?\n\n",

I have been told by nurses at work that my facial flushing is the classic textbook \"butterfly\" rash, and encouraed me to do Lupus research.  I was surprised to read Lupus can cause genital lesions like those of herpes herpes.  In 2006, I had an outbreak my gyn was convinced was herpes, with fever and kidney pain, but my herpes blood tests came back negative.  I was diagnosed with gastroparesis in 2002, with no reason as to the cause.  I also read that Lupus can cause this.  Could I have had Lupus for years and now getting worse?  I've been so tired, hurting everywhere- especially joints and where my liver is, and my brain and memory are still foggy.  Thanks.  Jen\n\n",

Upon doing research, I have remembered past unexpained problems - an outbreak of genital lesions, fever, kidney pain, which my gyn had told me was a new onset of herpes, but the blood tests confirmed I never had herpes.  No one could tell me why this happened (2006). In 2002, I was diagnosed with gastroparesis, but no one could figure out why, they tested me for diabetes.

    "content": "I'm a 24y/o female.  I have never smoked, I drink 12-20oz of wine daily, I eat a very balanced (mostly vegetarian) diet, I am of average weight, I exercise at least 40 minutes daily, practice tai chi, and have a reasonably stress-free life. I take birth control, have a heart murmur, and my blood carries the kel antigen.  For the past 6 months, I have had various upper torso problems.  My symptoms had been pain in my center ribcage area, just bellow the heart, and curious bowl movements(no blood, but frequent yellow discharge w/mucous-y stool) .  A GP ran blood tests and did a gallbladder ultrasound.  Everything came back normal and it was suggested if those symptoms persist, I should speak with a specialist. This was in September.  Shortly after, the pain stopped near the lower-center ribcage, and moved to my upper left shoulder/neck area and has recently begun to include my (left) chest.  It lasts all day and is mostly dull, but burns in the chest a little, tingles in my neck and jaw (left side only), feels like I have a knot in my shoulder, and randomly makes my left arm tingle - all the way to my finger-tips.  It waxes and wanes in severity, though it is never shockingly severe.  Since it is now almost always there and I'm getting the random arm-tingling, I am very concerned.  Also, my heart will feel like it flip-flops or misses a couple of beats - especially while exercising and walking (not casual walking; 3mpr w/15 extra lbs-walking). I still occasionally have similar curious bowel problems, but I can't be sure they are related.  I should note - not getting enough water or calories seems to up the severity.  However, drinking wine and taking a multivitamin makes it less noticeable.  I imagine I will be directed to speak with a cardiologist.... but I want to make sure there are no other suggestions from educated sources.  Thanks in advance, aaw\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Pain in the chest/rib cage area has several causes, most of them benign at your age. The most common is musculo-skeletal pain, originating from the ribs or muscles. This one is aggravated on breathing.   The other is Plurisy  but this will most often have associated features like fever, weight loss, etc.   It could also be due to some dyspepsia or excess gas formation in your intestines/stomach.  The pain which you describe as moving to neck and shoulder could have its origin in the spinal vertebra of the neck region.  A proper examination with your primary c are physician is required and she will advice you on the necesary tests or specialist opinion.  Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "For at least two weeks, maybe longer, I've had a pinching pain on the left side of my chest above my breast and slightly off to the side.  It only last a few seconds, and it usually only happens once or twice.  Today, I noticed it on several separate occasions, and today it hurt more.  Twice, it sort of ached with my pulse three of four times.    I was diagnosed with premature ventricular contractions when I was pregnant two years ago, but I only notice it when I'm anxious or exercising.  Could this be related? I'm pregnant again, but only five weeks (so I'm really concerned that there is something wrong with my heart!).  I also have GERD and a hiatal hernia, but my heartburn pain is usually pretty easy to distinguish, as it is a burning sensation and is right in the middle of my chest.    I just lowered my cholesterol from 234 to 201, and my BP is usually in the 120's over 80's (since having my daughter 2 years ago).  PLEASE get back to me soon.  This is really worrying me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  The type of pain that you describe has generally nothing to do with the heart. Heart pains are generally dull-aching, last longer than what you describe, usually come on after exertion-unless it is a heart attack- and are not localized as in your case.  A few premature ventricular contractions are always innocent and to be ignored. Pregnancy could trigger them because of the pressure of full uterus on the lower surface of the heart thru diaphragm.  I suggest you get in touch with your physician and an EKG if he thinks fit just to be on the safer side.  Apurva.\n\n",

I have a severe chest flutter, surge type feeling happening. It comes with dizziness, sweating . It usually wakes me up from a sound sleep. It is very intense and feels like my heart is jumpstarting itself. I continually check my pulse and it is consistantly at 70-72. This can go on up to an hour. It is happening more frequently and now comes with pain in head mostly on the crown and sides of head. All blood test normal, along with blood pressure. I know the cardiac cath came out normal, but is that for the arteries only ? Could there be another cardiac issue that may have been overlooked ?

From your description the possibility is that of a benign Supra Ventricular Tachycardia.   How ever one point against this possibility is the fact that your pulse is 70-72 at the time. But there are some other forms of arrhythmias where it will not reflect on the pulse like frequent ventricular premature beats.  In any case I strongly suggest you undergo a Holter 24 Hr. monitoring test through your cardiologist.  Apurva.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 28 year old healthy and moderately active female.  I'm height/weight proportionate, do not smoke, drink red wine or beer occasionally (I can only drink 1 every once in a while due to migraines) and do not use drugs.  I did smoke for about 2 years but quit approx 7 years ago.  The only minor health problems I have had were migraines, which are only about once every month or two and can be relieved by medication very easily, and a recurrent knee dislocation due to \"too much space\" within my joint, which was fixed about 5 years ago with reconstructive surgery.  I was told I have overly mobile joints, but other than my knee it hasn't caused me any problems.  I do currently take Wellbutrin XL once/day for major depression, which I have been on for approx 1 year, and it has worked very, very well for me.  The only anxiety/panic attacks that I recall having were when I was given phenergan (or anything similar), which caused me to have what I was told was a panic attack - I felt like I was coming out of my skin and couldn't breathe.  Each time I have gone for a checkup everything has been normal, and have been told my heart rate and blood pressure are a little low, but within normal range.  Although I would say I have a fairly high stress level because I work and go to school, as well as volunteer, my schedule and workload hasn't changed much in the last 2 years, but for someone like me who likes to stay busy it isn't too bad.  Recently I became very ill w/the flu and went to the hospital b/c upon waking I had very bad chest pains which radiated to my back.  The pain actually woke me up around 6am, although I normally wake around 7.  The pain was in what I would call almost a sideways tear-drop shape which started from just to the left of the middle of my chest to about the middle of my left breast (or underneath-not below- the area of my breast, rather), where the pain was a little broader in area than near the middle of my chest.  Within less than a minute of first feeling the pain I felt as if it radiated to my back, in a similar area, and it felt as if it was one big block of pain that didn't start or stop from one area to the other.  Changing position did not help, so thinking I had heartburn I took an antacid.  I didn't have any trouble breathing, though as I've noticed other people with chest pain have.  However, every 30 seconds or so I felt like there were butterflies in my chest around the area of the pain, and when I had the \"fluttering\" feeling I would experience a strange cold/numb/tingling feeling in my chin and gums (on the bottom of my jaw only), which went away when the fluttering did.  After waiting about 20 minutes with no sign of the pain getting better, but actually getting worse, and beginning to feel sick to my stomach, I went to the hospital.  I waited for about an hour, in which time the pain subsided.  By the time I was seen I felt just fine, but was pretty exhausted.  When they initially took my pulse they said it was in the 150's - they asked if I felt like my heart was racing or was having trouble breathing and I said no...  right before they called me in I had nodded off in the waiting area, so I was actually fairly relaxed.  I told them that was a bit strange b/c I was always told I had a low (but normal) heart rate.  Questions they asked - on birth control? no.  Pain upon touching the chest? no.  Acid feeling/taste in throat/mouth? no.  At that point I told them I didn't know if I really should be seen because I was feeling better, but they said it would be good to take an EKG to be safe and give me some fluids and antibiotics since I was sick.  They took a chest xray which they said was \"a little cloudy\" and the EKG was normal.  I was told the pain was probably due to bronchitis and sent home w/rx's for antibiotics, decongestant and a pain reliever, but I didn't fill the pain reliever b/c they always make me sick.  I called in sick and slept for several hours.  I once again woke up with the chest pain.  Since they didn't find anything wrong before I thought it would be silly to go back to the hospital.  This time it only lasted about 10 minutes or so and slowly subsided as it did the last time.  I was up for about an hour or so after that but felt pretty tired again so went back to sleep and slept until the next morning.  I have not had the pain again, however I do recall having this pain, though not as bad, before, but I didn't think too much of it other than heartburn or something.  I've had these pains, which are exactly the same in the area they occur, and always in the morning, maybe about once or twice a year since I was a teenager, high school I think.  However, it was never ever nearly as painful as this last episode and I didn't experience the strange sensation in my jaw.  I don't recall whether I felt so tired before like this time, but then again was sick with the flu.    Since this last episode I have experienced sort of what I would call a racing heart beat, but only after I eat and it feels like my heart is thumping hard.  It doesn't seem to follow any pattern, though - sometimes it happens in the am or pm, and thinking it was what I ate or drank, tried to eat/drink the same things again but it did not always occur.  Some days I don't get it at all.  Within I guess a half hour or so it subsides.  Sometimes when having this racing feeling I feel a little lightheaded, sometimes not - but each time I get that weird feeling in my jaw and gums again.  Again, I don't notice anything about my breathing; I feel like I can breathe just fine.  This happens once, sometimes twice, every day or two.  Prior to being sick this hasn't happened.  The pain I had before was, on a scale of 1-10, maybe a 3 or 4, if I were to say my knee dislocating was a 9, a bad migraine is a 6, and a typical headache or body ache is a 1.  The pain I had this last time was about a 6 or 7.  It was a 6 starting out, got worse so I guess peaked at a 7, then subsided gradually.  Something about this episode as opposed to the last episodes bothered me, and the more I thought about it the more worried I became.  I went online and researched chest pain, as well as these boards, but nothing described exactly what I felt.  Everything I read about chest pain describes sharp, burning, dull, crushing, etc. - none of that seems to fit right, but it's hard to describe because I just haven't felt anything like it before.  Sharp to me is like when my knee dislocated.  Dull is maybe like body aches the next day after working out.  I don't know that I would know what burning or crushing is but I don't think it was that.  The pain just really hurt... it didn't throb or feel stabbing, it was just...there, and wouldn't go away.  It didn't change when I moved or changed position, walked vs. sat down or laying down, or change with breathing.  It was either there or it wasn't.  The reason I am now really concerned is because I don't think it was similar to what I read the pain associated w/bronchitis is, since the pain didn't change w/breathing or coughing.    Now I'm afraid of having it again, but I don't want to get myself worked up over nothing, or go to the doctor and sound like a crazy person when it may just be something really simple.  Since I am so young and pretty much in good health, and am not having any trouble when exercising, I don't know that it's likely that it's cardiac in origin but I guess I just want to know if it's possible, and if I should or shouldn't bother going to see a doctor about.  We do not have a history of heart attacks or anything on either side of my family, but I do know that 2 uncles on my mom's side had some sort of valve issue and both had murmurs.  I think my great-aunt had something similar, but don't remember if it was exactly the same thing; I do know she had to take some medication for it, though.  One of my uncles had surgery to repair whatever it was that was wrong and as far as I know he has done pretty well ever since, but I think he still takes medication.  Other than that, other issues that run in my family but may not be of any relation to what I'm experiencing are: ovarian cancer (my mom), knee/joint issues, migraines and a couple females on both sides have thyroid problems.  Sorry for the long post - I guess I just had to get it all down on \"paper\" to sort through all these concerns floating around in my head that I can't figure out.  Is there anything serious this could be, or am I just worrying about nothing, or something that isn't that big of a deal?  Thank you for your time and any advice you can give!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Cheric,  It seems that you have had an episode of chest pain, which does not fit into any of the well recognised patterns or diagnoses. One can be certain of a few things though. 1) You do not have a Pneumonia or Pluirisy, as your chest X ray does not show it to be so. 2) You don not have a Heart Attack as your EKG has been reported to be normal, though you did have a fast pulse.  Also other serious caused of such a pain are already ruled out such as Pnemothorax, tuberculosis etc. One cause-dissecting aortic aneurysm is not objectively ruled out here but it is extremely unlikely because the pain of it is on the extreme and your clinical condition would be far far serious if it was so.   In my opinion your pain seems to be due to some pull of an intrathoracic muscle during your sleep, which will not show up on any of the tests conducted to diagnose a chest pain.   Another likely hood is a Pre Herpetic pain, a pain which precedes the development of a Herpes Zoster rash. In this case the pain is followed by the rash on the same area in a matter of 5-7 days. It is a viral condition and easily treatable with antiviral antibiotics.  However if the rash does not come up, I would stick to my earlier diagnosis of a musculoskeletal chest pain, and you would need only some pain relievers, on as and when needed basis.  Apurva.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  I am a 22 year old student who experiences chest pain, slightly to the left side.  The pain usually includes sensations in my left arm, from tinging to numbness, to just a dull pain. The chest pain was always brought on by alcohol the morning/night after and left me with palpitations and dizzyness also.   However, I have recently cut out the alcohol for a month and while I have been feeling a bit better I still experience pain sometimes from exertion and sometimes when at rest. Including this I have been experiencing some general symptoms, such as headaches and more frequent bowel movements (From 1 to 3 times a day).  The doctor checked my blood pressure which was normal, and so were a few general blood tests. He dismissed it as heart burn and gave me proton pump inhibitors. I do not feel the pain is a burning one particularly.   I am perfect weight for my height, eat an OK diet for a student, but exercise infrequently.   thanks, im getting so sick and tired of this!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Bread123,  I would recommend you see a cardiologist about this.  At your age a cardiac problem is much less likely but can still occur.  When dealing with the heart it is always safest to be sure there is no problem.  If your heart checks out you may want to see a GI specialist to further evaluate the issue of reflux.  This is probably the most common cause of chest pain in your age group.  Also, the proton pump inhibitors can take several days to become fully effective so if you just started taking them you may not yet be noticing an effect.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Det,  Having the ECG's was appropriate since dull chest pain occasionally can be heart related.  Given that you are young and, it sounds like, in pretty good shape, heart problems are a bit less likely.  Even still, one would not want to be wrong about the heart so having it evaluated is a good idea.  Other, more likely causes include gastroesophageal reflux (indigestion) that can present solely as chest discomfort, pleurisy (inflammation of the lining of the lungs/chest wall) or costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage part of the ribs).  Pleurisy is typically made worse by taking a deep breath.  Costochondritis typically has pain that is reproducible by pressing on the area that hurts.  When you are having this pain you may want to try taking an antacid (such as tums or mylanta) to see if this helps some.  If it does, reflux is very likely.  If this pain gets worse or doesn't go away I would recommend you see your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "dr. lowe,  thank you for the response.  i have a follow up question, and i would appreciate it if you could please bear with me.  lately, i've started exercising, and when i'm at the point of cardiac exertion during running, i feel a discomfort in my chest that is sometimes on the right, sometimes on the left, and is not necessarily at a single spot everytime. it has not quite been under my sternum, however, but does seem to be in the upper half of the ribcage.  if i breathe deeper, the pain tends to be greater.  i would not call it sharp per se, but i can definitely feel a pointed pain at certain locations even if i'm not trying to take very deep breaths.  again, this is only during exertion.  i had not exercised in about a year till just recently, so perhaps it is my system getting used to the strain of running and maybe it'll go away as i run more and more.  in the past, i would, of course, feel that fatigue and discomfort in the chest that comes with exertion, and my memory could certainly be wrong, but this seems different.  also, when i'm lifting weights, there is no discomfort that i feel, but it is there when i do cardio workouts, i.e. running.  a few times, i've also felt a numbness in my left forearm (only while sitting, no exertion), something that scares me even more.  the numbness, at least to my knowledge, doesn't accompany chest pains or other symptoms.   i am rather worried, and i'm sorry that my descriptions are vague.  i feel like i'm too young to get heart disease, and though i'm far from perfect, i try to watch my diet, and coronary artery disease is frankly a frightening prospect.  do you think i'm worrying unnecessarily, or could the symptoms i've described be indicative of something?  is there anything you would recommend?  thanks so much\n\n",

I would recommend you follow up with your doctor about these symptoms to be fully evaluated.  This way the exam and detailed history can help guide any testing that may be needed.

    "title": "Re: bad heart valves / chest pain",
    "content": "Hello Whatever1921,  Generally, sharp chest pain is less likely to be cardiac related.  Cardiac pain is often described more as a severe painful pressure that is a little difficult to pinpoint exactly where it is coming from (often described as being more diffuse rather than being able to point exactly to the pain spot).    Often, leaky valves put extra strain on the heart and symptoms will relate more to difficulty pumping blood.  This can lead to back up of blood in the lungs and cause coughing and difficulty breathing.  Also, symptoms of severe fatigue and inability to tolerate activity.  Follow up with your cardiologist is important to continue to follow the status of your valves.  If symptoms of heart failure begin to develop it may be necessary to try to repair the valves.  Your cardiology may want you to take some medications to help reduce the workload of the heart and try to prevent further damage.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The jumping feeling you are describing may be a dysrhythmia such as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).  SVT is not necessarily dangerous but finding out what is going on will be important because sometimes there may be a treatment needed to help prevent complications.  If it is happening uncommonly, a simply ECG may not catch the issue.  In these cases there are some other versions of the ECG that can record over a longer period of time.  Often, seeing a cardiologist may be helpful to determine if these types of tests are needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Toy,  There are a few cases in the literature describing an entity that is now well established called Laughter induced syncope (or fainting).  The mechanism is thought to be that the laughing causes contraction of the diaphragm which subsequently impedes blood flow back to the heart.  This is not particularly dangerous since the patient subsequently regains consciousness rapidly; however, it can be a definite annoyance and injuries can occur from passing out and falling.  I would recommend you see a neurologist to have this further evaluated.  Occasionally, some physical therapy and chest wall strengthening can help.  Also, laying flat can help prevent you from passing out if you feel it coming on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

These are usually reliable but always must be reviewed because they can frequently be incorrect.  In particular, there are many rhythm variants that are completely normal in younger people that are abnormal in adults.  The EKG machines are less reliable when interpreting these EKG's of younger people.  The T waves have several normal variations in them so I would generally trust the cardiologist if he is saying it is normal.  The shortness of breath may be due to non cardiac issues as well, so follow up with her doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

(sorry all my medical terms might not be right)  2 weeks after the surgery she was feeling better than she had in a long time. 3 weeks after that, she started complaining of chest pain again, shortness of breath, fatigue, palpatations.  We went to doctor for monthly check-up, had her echo done.  Doctor said Echo looked fine, but EKG was showing WPW (Wolf-Parker white), had a few other tests done, including CT, chest x-ray, and blood work.    Before all this she was a Fitness Personal Trainer, so has been in very good health, now she is just fatigued most of the time.   We have been to the doctor several times about it, without much of an answer.   This is a different doctor than the one that originally diagnosed the ASD, we have since moved to a smaller area.   The last we heard from the doctor was that it \"could\" be pericarditis, and to up the asprin dosage to 6 325mg per day for one week - it got better for a little while, and then came back again.   It seems to do that no matter the treatment.   This weekend we went to the ER hoping to finally rule it out, when she didn't even have enough eneregy to get out of bed, strong chest pain, dizziness - but all tests looked good.   They gave her something for the chest pain, (can't remember name) but just seemed to make it worse.  Were at a loss here, and very frustated hoping for any help.  The surgery was almost 4 months ago, the only medication she has been on is Plavix, and Eceterin coated Asprin 325.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Pazu,  Your wife needs to follow up with her cardiologist.  Her symptoms are concerning for heart failure type issues.  It is important to be sure that everything continues to heal well with the patch placement.  Also, if she has Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, she will be at risk for a dysrhythmia known as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).  SVT is essentially a very fast beating of the heart (in the 180 range often).  It can give all the symptoms that your wife is feeling.    She may need to wear a 24 hour holter EKG monitor to record her EKG for a prolonged period of time to see if there are any intermittent rhythms, such as SVT, that are occurring but being missed by the one-time EKG's.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 20 year old male presenting recurring chest pain. These pains began about one year and a half ago when I was a chronic marijuana user. Most of the times I would smoke marijuana, I would experience a slight pain in the upper left part of my chest near the shoulder. I have also abused a variety of other drugs in the past including over the counter cough medication containing dextromethorphan. I have used cocaine, but not in the past year and was never a heavy or even moderate user of it and it never caused me pain. I have not used crack cocaine. I no longer use drugs; I had smoked cigarettes for three and a half years but have been a nonsmoker for two months. About two months ago, these pains existed without my using marijuana so I went to the ER and got a X-Ray which the doctor said revealed a hyperinflated lung. A few days after, I took one inhalation of marijuana and experienced pain in my upper central chest and went to the ER. I received an EKG and an echocardiogram, both of which returned normal. Since then I have been back to the ER five times, with similar symptoms, sometimes with pain radiating into the left arm, left jaw, back, and upper abdomen. These pains have occurred dozens of times, only one time after exertion. I had a stress EKG with radionuclides done and it was normal. I am not taking any medications. My grandparents all had a cardiac history, but none before their 50s or 60s. I still get the pains, they are not severe, but extremely disconcerting. What could be wrong, what should I do?\n\n",

In these cases, the next culprit is the lungs.  It may be that you have some inflammation and irritation of your lungs that is causing your chest pain.  The marijuana smoke may have exacerbated this irritation causing the episode to occur when you were smoking.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Lately I have been experiencing a sharp shooting pain on the left side of my chest, seemingly coming from my heart. It typically occurs when I am at rest, for example watching TV or eatting a meal. It has really only been doing this for the last week or so but it happens 2-3 times per day and lasts for 2-4 seconds.   I don't know if it is related, but throughout my life I have experienced a very sharp pain over my heart maybe 2-3 times per year. My mom said she used to have the same problem when she was younger but her doctor said there was no problem. The pain I experience with this usually lasts 10-20 seconds and during this time it is very difficult to take deep breaths.  It has always concerned me, but especially now with the pain occuring daily, although shorter in duration, I am becoming very worried. I am a 24 year old male, 160 lbs, not very physically active. I recently became uninsured so I wanted to try here before I head in to see a doctor. Thanks for your help!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sharp Chest Pain",
    "content": "Hi Syrius323,  Heart pain is generally more of a dull, painful pressure that is a bit hard to put into one specific spot.  Sharp, shooting pain tends not to be from the heart (although there are exceptions to every rule).  The pain you are describing sounds to me to be more consistent with pleurisy or possibly costochondritis.  Pleurisy is inflammation of the lining of the lungs/chest wall.  The pain can be very severe.  Classically, this pain is made worse by deep breathing because this causes the inflamed lining to rub on the chest wall.  It can come and go and often pain attacks are brief.  Costochondritis is inflammation of the cartilage part of the rib (along the front portion of the rib).  This pain is classically reproduced by pushing on the area that hurts.    Both these conditions can come and go.  Both are best treated by using an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen.  Having said that, the heart is nothing to be wrong about so I would recommend you see a doctor for this to be sure your heart is OK if your pain is continuing.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "28 Year Old Chest Pains - What's My Next Step Please?",
    "content": "Hello, I have been having chest pains for about the past two months and they are really starting to worry me although I have been to the doctor several times about this. This is a long story so please bear with me and tell me what why next step should be. I am a 28 year old male with no family history of heart conditions. I lost 3 of my grandparents due to COPD but they were all multipack a day smokers and that was the cause of their problem. I don't smoke, don't drink, but I don't eat that healthy and   over the past years have not excersized regularly. I am 6' 210 pounds. On October 31 I went to my family doctor experiencing shortness of breath out of the blue and he diagnosed me as having allergies due to a change in pollen level. He checked my blood pressure and pulse rate it was 130/80 with a heart rate of 80 bpm. He gave me an inhaler, an antibiotic, and an allergy medication. I left the doctors office and took the medications as instructed and laid down at home to rest. About an hour later I was gasping for air with racing heart and feeling flushed in my face from high blood pressure. I ended up in the emergency room with a heart rate of 130 bpm and a blood pressure of 190/110. They checked my oxygen saturation and it was at 96% and they decided I was having a panic attack. They gave me an injectable of something to calm me down and my heart rate dropped to the high 80s, my blood pressure went down to around 160/90 and my oxygen saturation went to near 100%. They explained I was panicking due to not being able to breath and that the medications the doctor had given me all would raise my heart rate.  This caused me to need more oxygen which in turned caused me to breath harder and basically caused a panic attack. I have never had a panic attack in my life so it sounded feasible due to the explanation and I hope that is still what is causing this. The suggested I lay off of  any type of caffinated beverages and that I stay off from work a few days to relax. They did chest x-rays to make sure there was no fluid on my lungs and that I didn't have pneumonia and then sent me home. I did as instructed and sat at home but the more I sat at home the more I thought about it and it got worse. I managed to convince myself that there was something wrong with my heart. At this time I still was not experiencing chest pains. I did however start to feel something in the upper left part of my chest near my shoulder that felt like a pulsing and my girlfriend made me go to the local Urgent Care clinic being that my family doctor wasn't open and I didn't want to end up back at the ER.  Once again my blood pressure was through the roof, 180/110 and my pulse rate was at 119 bpm. I attribute part of this to my nervousness. I told them about the feeling in my upper chest and they did an EKG on me and said it looked healthy except for the 119 bpm heart rate and told me that with my heart at that rate, ofcourse I was going to feel something my chest. I was sitting still and my heart rate was where I should be at a run. The once again diagnosed it as stress due to me worrying about this condition and this time gave me a prescription for valium and told me to follow up with my family doctor and ask him about the blood pressure.   I went home and took the valium and the following week went to my family doctor. He once again said allergies, said that i was very sensative to medication and blew off the blood pressure thing by not even checking it. His nurse checked it and it was 180/80 with a pulse rate of 110. I asked him about the blood pressure and he said it's nothing to worry about and didn't bother to check it again. He told me I was dehyratred and told me to drink a lot of gatoraid and eat some soup. At this point I decided to find another doctor because he didn't seem concerned and willing to listen to my concerns. He just wanted to give me more valiums. I went to a new doctor who is an internalogist and he agreed that he belived everything was stress induced but decided to do a lot of tests just to make sure. He did blood tests to check for thyroid function, adrenaline levels, and to did a 24 hour urinalysis to check kidney function. He also asked me to monitor my blood pressure at home since it was high when I went to his office and he suspected white coat hypertension. He did the normal listening to my heart and did an EKG and couldn't find anything wrong so he told me to relax told me he thought it was stress and gave me something besides the valium that would act faster and scheduled another appointment for a few days later when my test results came back. In the  mean time he advised me to start excersizing that it couldn't hurt so  I did. I've been getting on the treadmill daily and either walking at 3.5 mph or jogging at anywhere from 5.5-7.5 for 20-30 minutes a night. I found that this would actually relax me for a while because it would burn off energy. I experience NO chest pains while doing this I can do a 10 mph sprint for 2 minutes and never miss a beat it feels good actually. I went back to get the results to my tests and he said my thyroid was normal, my kidneys were functioning normally, and that all other tests came back normal but my blood pressure was still high. He said again he thought this was anxiety so he put me on a low dose. 12.5 mg of biluprolol to get my heart rate and blood pressure down and to counter the affects of the adrenaline which he felt was keeping my blood pressure high. I had also been experiencing pain in my jaws and itching sensations. After taking this and getting it into my system it dropped my blood pressure to constant 120s/70s to 110s/60s and my pulse rate into the 60s and keeps it there. It did however cause me to feel really odd and I started feeling light headed and at one time ended up falling because I got weak and woosy and fell down. I also started feeling itching sensations on the bottoms of my arms and burning like I had been lifting weights on the skin of my shoulders. It almost felt like I had a sunburn. This really concerned us both so he did more tests on me. I did a D-Dimer which came back fine and also an echocardiogram which a cardiologist at the local hopsital as well as he said were both normal. He also did ANOTHER ekg to compare to the previous two and he said they were both fine. In the mean time, while waiting for the echocardiogram to come back I managed somehow for the symptoms to somewhat go away but they came back. About two weeks ago I had my follow up visit and he decided that it was time to look into an antidepresent because of the \"anxiety.\" He put me on 12.5 mg of zoloft and told me to go to 25 mg in two weeks, and 50 two weeks after that and to take it daily. He put me on a low dose because he thinks I'm really sensative to medications. I started taking this and every since I have had increased chest pains and tingly feelings in my toes and fingers. The chest pains come and go and will either be a sharp pain right below my rib cage on my left side, a pressure on my right side just beside my brest bone (which doesn't hurt), or a dull pressure feeling on my left side right above my nipple. I also am experiencing a heart burn like sensation which has gotten worse since I started this but had started along with a lot of belching right after these symptoms first started. I have found now that getting in the hot tub for around 10 minutes will make these sensations go away, perhaps it's relaxing the muscles? I don't understand and it's scaring me I don't know what to do. I have 5 different doctors now that are saying it's stress and several tests to back it up but that's not really helping. My doctor told me that the Zoloft could be causing this and that it will take time to get used to it. I looked up and some of the side affects of zoloft can be the above symptoms but they are rare.  What should I do now? Is this heart related? Can this be my heart or am I just stressing myself out causing it myself. The shortness of breath has actually gone away since I started the zoloft but the chest sensations that have replaced it are making me very nervous. What should we check next or should I just try to relax, ignore these symptoms, and give the zoloft time to work? Thanks, any guidance or reassurance would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mustanggt90,  Your symptoms do sound consistent with anxiety induced issues.  Your pain does not particularly sound concerning for cardiac issues.  It sounds like you've had quite an extensive work up for cardiac issues as well.  If the zoloft does not begin to help your symptoms in the next few weeks I would recommend you follow up with your doctor for further evaluation.  Unfortunately, Zoloft (and all the SSRI's like Zoloft) can take up to 4 weeks to reach full effect so you probably won't notice immediate results.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am 23 years old male, 67kgs weight and 172cm tall. I had almost 3 weeks persistent shortness of breath (dyspnea), no cough, no wheezing, nausea (sometimes, very rare) and it was not getting better even I'm not doing anything. In the last 3 days I felt air hungry in the classroom and also lightheadedness, tingling and felt sleepy all the day. I had a history on Asthma (when I was child).  I went to the doctor so many times. They did X-ray chest to me (2 times, 1 at ER, 1 at student health center). Both told me that the result is negative. Then I also took spirometry test with the result: -----------PreMed------%Pred-----PostMed-----%Pred FVC-------4.15-----------83%------- 4.26-----------85% FEV1------3.62-----------84%------- 3.73-----------87% %FEV1--87.22---------102%------- 87.55--------102% FEF--------4.11----------85%------- 4.52-----------94% PEF--------9.09-----------98%------- 9.14-----------99% FEV3-------4.11----------83%------- 4.21-----------85% FET---------5.23-------------------------4.29 The doctor told me there is no problem with my lung. Then I took EKG, the machine told us that there ST elevation, consider pericarditis, borderline abnormal. But my doctor wasn't sure that my shortness of breath is because pericarditis, since that result can occur in an EKG of normal person and she also found that my heart is normal from her observation (using stethoscope). And she always told me that my dyspnea is just because of psychological condition/anxiety.Actually long time ago, I felt pain on my chest and also 1 week pain on my left lower back. I'm affraid there is something wrong with my heart. My blood pressure is 110-120/70-80. I also had some problems with my stomach (gastric acid) especially when I missed my mealtime (nausea, heartburn). I am from Indonesia and just arrived at Tallahassee 2 months ago. Is there any relationship between there weather difference?   My doctor gave me albuterol inhaler, but it didn't help me at all. Then the doctor at ER diagnosed with allergic reaction and gave me prednisone and allegra. I'm feeling better after I took prednisone. What is actually the disease I'm suffering from? Is it heart problem? GERD? lung problem? Asthma?  What could you say about my symptoms? I'm getting frustated now. If I want to go to specialist, which one should I see? Cardiologist? Pulmonologist? Allergist?  Thank you very much\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Persistent Shortness of Breath",
    "content": "Hi Heribertus,  Your symptoms fit asthma although your pulmonary function testing doesn't particularly support this.  If, however, you weren't having a lot of symptoms at the point it may simply have been that your PFT's were normal because they didn't catch the bad point.  Pericarditis could potentially cause this as well but your symptoms don't particularly make me that suspicious of pericarditis.  The tricky part of all this is that prednisone will treat most of the things that could be causing your symptoms so getting better with prednisone unfortunately doesn't help figure out the cause.  On the other side of the issue is that you have gotten better so if you don't know what caused it but it doesn't come back your in good shape even though the cause isn't known.  I would recommend that you see your doctor again if any symptoms return.  If you want to see a specialist I would suggest you first see a pulmonologist, then possibly a cardiologist if everything checks out with the pulm. doc.  Best wishes.\n\n",

This is very common and many people get worked up for heart problems that subsequently find their heart to be normal but reflux is present.  You may want to try taking an antacid the next time you have this pain to see if it helps.

    "content": "I am a 26 year old female, 5'6\", 250 lbs.  My blood pressure is normal (120/80,) but cholesterol is high (genetic.)  After having several blood tests (CBC, Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, Thyroid,) everything looks normal.  There is no heart disease or any other health problems in my family.  I have never had any health problems in my life until this point.    At the beginning of September, I began having chest pains on the left side of my chest, right above my left breast and a bit towards the middle.  They weren't horrible pains, but since it was a pain in my chest, it worried me.  They seem to occur randomly, not after eating or when working out.  I went to the doctor who ran an EKG, ordered bloodwork, and said it didn't appear to be my heart.  Two days later, I felt like my left arm was going numb, which triggered a panic attack, and I went to the ER.  They did more bloodwork, urine sample, chest X-rays, and another EKG.  They also said my heart looked just fine.  The chest pains went away for about a month or so, but came back later.  Around the same time, I began worrying alot about my husband's safety (for no apparent reason,) and the chest pains began to come back.  They told me I had anxiety, put me on cymbalta, and sent me on my way.  The cymbalta side effects were horrible, so I got off after a week.  The anxiety went away for the week I was on the meds and the week after I got off.  During this time, I was still having intermittent chest pains, but they didn't seem to have any rhyme or reason.    After a week off of the cymbalta, the anxiety came back with a vengeance, this time worrying about my own health.  (Due in large part to the chest pains.)  Around this time, the doctor ordered a 24 hour holter monitor for my peace of mind, and those results all came back normal as well.  She said if the pain kept happening to go see a cardiologist.  I also had an Upper GI/Barium swallow, which showed mild reflux, but nothing else.  My doctor put me on Buspar, which I have been on for two weeks now.  It has definitely helped with the anxiety.  Occasionally I still have a chest pain, but not as often as I was.  I am still worried, though, that there could be something with my heart that they aren't catching.  Do I need to see a cardiologist or are the tests that have already been administered enough to reassure me that my heart is okay?   I still have occasional numbness/tingling in my left arm and hand (very mild,) and on a couple of occasions I have felt very mild tingling/numbness on the left side of my face, as well.  Could this all be related?  In addition to the BuSpar, I take Loestrin Fe as well as vitamins, fish oil, folic acid, and iron.  Thank you so much for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm sorry you are having these symptoms.  Don't underestimate the strength and reality of psychological problems that cause physical complaints.  This is real and hopefully the medication and therapy will help you to resolve the issue if it is of this nature.  But, the reason I'm sure the doctor suggested a cardiologist is because you are having symptoms and nothing has shown up in the usual battery of tests.   She wants to be sure if there is something there that you are in good hands for that diagnosis.   I believe it sounds very likely that your heart is fine, but only you can determine if you need this type of specialist.  If you are still feeling uncomfortable and ill-at-ease, the consultation might be worth it for you to get peace of mind.  But if that doctor agrees your heart is fine, you will need to pursue other avenues for dealing with it so stay with your psychiatrist on this.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Chest and left arm pain with constant belching",
    "content": "I am a 37 yo male, 5'10'' 180lbs., non-smoker, no family history of heart disease. In the last few days I have been experiencing sudden pains in the left side of my chest and in my left arm, accompanied by constant belching throughout the day. The pain would come and go, lasting a few seconds, sometimes dull, sometimes sharp, sometimes just a burning. I would get it at different times of the day, regardless of my activities. I have had this in the past, although the symptoms were slightly different, as I also had a lump in my throat to go with belching and chest pain. I did all kind of cardiology tests (last time was 6-7 months ago): two stress tests, lab analysis, ultrasound. Everything OK: the cardiologist said go home, your heart is fine. I was sent to a gastroentherologist, and was given a barium swallow which only evidenced some reflux. I was diagnosed an esophagitis, possible GERD. I took Nexium, symptoms went away, coming back only occasionally.  Now, in the last week or so they came back. I started taking Nexium again, but it's giving me no relief. I know it's very likely that this is a gastroenterologic problem, but I'm still worried. I have also read that belching \"could\" also be a symptom of heart attack: although, does this apply to such frequent belching? The pains in the chest and arm are getting me very worried. Is it possible that this could be caused by some kind of blockage that could eventually lead to heart disease? How could I be absolutely positive that my heart is out of the picture? I have read about a test in which they inject you in the bloodstream something that reacts to x-ray, hence evidencing any kind of blockage in a vein or an artery. How is this test called? Could it help me finally achieve piece of mind and to make me sure that my problems are confined to my digestive tract? Thank you very much for your time\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Cosmo09,  Your symptoms that you are describing are actually all very consistent with gastroesophageal reflux.  Given your past history, I think this is probably most likely.  However, when the heart is possibly involved, the stakes of being wrong go up so it is always safest to do some testing for the heart.  This would basically involve an EKG to look for any changes consistent with heart problems.  The cardiac test you are referring to is known as a cardiac catheterization.  Unfortunately, it is actually much more involved than simply injecting dye into the vein and taking an x-ray.  It requires placing a large IV into the groin vein and then inserting a wire that goes all they way up into the heart.  The dye is then injected into the are directly at the opening of the cardiac arteries (the coronaries).  The procedure can have significant side effects and has some recovery time so it is usually only done when there is already evidence of a problem.  I would suggest you see your doctor again for a full check up.  This way you can address the heart issue and see if there is other treatment needed for your symptoms.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Meredith,  I am concerned by your description of your pain.  The presence of elevation/depression of the ST segment can be indicative of cardiac ischemia (times when the heart isn't getting enough oxygen/nutrients).  While the pain you are describing may be muscular, it may also be from cardiac pain.  The stress test is important.  Follow up with your doctor is crucial.  Hopefully, everything is OK with your heart but it is best to be safe and find out for sure.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Since I was given the adenosine, the pressure in my upper left chest has eased up (arm still achy), that tells me it may be heart-related (also, when I was given nitroglycerin in the ER, it eased the pressure for about a week)...  I was looking at ischemia, too, it nails my symptoms.\n\n",

    "title": "23 y/o experiencing persistent frightening symptoms",
    "content": "I apologize if this post is too long. I just don't want to leave out too many details. I'm a 23 y/o female, overweight and have a strong family history of heart disease. Both of my grandfathers died before the age of 60 of heart attacks and my dad had a heart attack when he was 37 and then another at 42 which killed him. I have been getting control of my weight and have lost almost 60 pounds to date, I eat healthy, exercise and do not smoke or drink. I am not on any medications.  The first time I noticed something may be wrong was a couple of years ago. Out of the blue I felt a sharp shooting pain in my left arm. It felt severe and went from the top of my shoulder down to my elbow. The pain increased when I inhaled or exhaled deeply and lasted for over a week. Every once in a while I feel feel that similar shooting pain but usually only lasts for a few seconds although on occasion it's lasted a few days. It's usually brought on by inhaling deeply, laughing exessively or exerting myself in the cold.   Some other symptoms I've felt over the last couple of years are ~Soreness and tightness in the center of my chest that usually lasts for days ~Pain in my upper back when I inhale also lasting for days or longer ~dull aches in either arm ~A very odd sensation that I wouldnt necessarily describe as pain, but definitely a major discomfort. I get a sharp pain/ache in the center of my throat that almost instantly feels like it rises up my esophogus to the back of my neck and head and also down the center of my chest. It feels like a really intense fullness or pressure, almost as if a balloon is inflating and it can last anywhere from 5 minutes to upwards of 20 minutes. Only lying down and burping seems to help it go away. Sometimes while thats happening, my ear canals feel achey and that same fullness. It happens out of the blue, usually while I'm at home doing absolutely nothing. It's only happened a handful of times but its very uncomfortable.  4 months ago I went to 2 emergency rooms in 2 days because I thought I was having a heart attack. For over a week I felt dizzy, weak, abnormally fatigued, had shooting pains around my collar bone and left arm and I was having difficultly breathing. I felt like I could not get any deep breaths to fill my lungs. I had chest xrays, EKG, ECG, blood tests and also had a CT scan of my abdoman, thorax pelvis and legs b/c the doctor was worried about a pulmonary embolism but all tests came back clear. My symptoms went away for the most part a few days later but have continued to come back in some form at least every week. Common current symptoms are now ~Shortness of breath. Sometimes I feel like I'm suffocating or drowning. I find myself trying to yawn and swallow a lot. Sometimes I feel a pressure in the base of my neck/throat in between my collar bone, almost like someone is pushing down on it. Breathing is a struggle at least 70% of the time and sometimes I feel like my body forgets how to do it. ~Heart palpatations almost every single night. As I lie down at night and start to feel like I'm going to doze off, I'll feel the pulse of my neck start to throb and then my heart will start pounding. My Blood pressure is normally 120/68 but when I take it at night it will rise to about 143/92. One night about a week ago as I was falling asleep I was jolted up with an odd sensation in my throat. It felt almost like something in my throat was convulsing and my heart rate had to have been well over 200. I felt my eyes bugging out of their sockets and there was a good few seconds where I literally could not breathe.  A few other things. For 4 months I have a pain on the upper left hand side of my back. I don't think its a muscle strain because when I first noticed it, it was when I woke up in the morning and it just never went away. It hurts and feels tight when I inhale and the pain seems to be spreading to other parts of my back. For the last few days I've been dizzy, fatigued and both arms ached, this time underneath near my armpits and spread across my chest. I frequently feel a soreness in the center of my chest also. My jaw doesnt hurt but it has been stiff for a few days now and I have a very vague sensation of that sharp pain in my throat(but nowhere near as severe as what I described above)  I'm not a doctor but from everything I've been reading and have heard about heart disease and heart attack symptoms, I seem to fit the profile despite my age.  I have a doctor appointment on thursday and I will be sure to bring up everything I just mentioned but my question is, is it possible to be experiencing these types of symptoms without necessarily having a life threatening condition? I'm terrified I'm having a heart attack or will have one soon but I'm worried that something is going to somehow be overlooked. I didnt have an echocardiogram or stress test so are those tests I should ask for if my doctor doesnt happen to recommend it on her own? I keep trying to calm myself down saying maybe I just have some type of valvular deformity that isnt necessarily life threatening like MVP but that pain in the back of my throat has me really worried. Everyone seems to think what I've been experiencing is anxiety but I really strongly believe it's something else. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "22 female hypothyroidism, PCOS, right now a kidney infection, taking synthroid & macrobid  Mother has hypertension, grandfather coronary artery disease, grandmother congestive heart failure  I know I'm young, but I had an episode of pain that started underneath my left arm (armpit, not arm), after a few hours i was getting chest pain, but the pain only lasted a few seconds then went away.  This happened several times, never lasting longer than 2 or 3 seconds, maybe happened 4 times over 3 hours.  Maybe more.  It was a pinching feeling.  My chest later on started to tighten up, but I could recreate the same feeling by pressing on the spot in my chest where it hurt, so I figured it was a panic attack.  I had several feelings inside me, one in my back near the outside lower corner of my left shoulder blade.  It was a throb, like somebody trying to push something through a tube that is too small, then releasing it.  That happened several times.  The pain stopped in my chest, but all day now my chest has been sore.  I figure it was because I was incredibly tense.  The soreness goes from the center of my chest, outward on my breasts, down the inner sides of both breasts.  Is this muscular pain from being tense?  I also had cold sweats later today & now have a headache in the right side of my head & roof of my mouth.  Sorry for this being so long, & sorry for posting so many questions.  I don't like to rush off to the doctor, but I don't want to not go if I need to.  I called my doctor about the symptoms but it was very late in the day (4:00, they close at 5) and he never called back.  Please help and thank you SO much.\n\n",

I had yet another EKG which was normal and had blood taken because she wanted to check my cholesterol and thyroid. I was sent home with a holter moniter and am wearing it now. I asked about an echocardiogram and she said she didnt think I needed one but would set me up for one if I really wanted it. I let her know my concerns about possibly having MVP or another valvular deformity but she said she didnt hear any clicks or murmurs when she listened to my heart. I'll write back when I get my results back which will probably be in a week or so.  In the meantime I'm starting to think that maybe nothing really is wrong with my heart. I know that all of my symptoms are not just in my head though so I really cant begin to phathom what else could be causing this. However there still is that little part of me that can't help but think of all of the horror stories I've read on medical message boards where people experienced similar symptoms to me and also got cleared from their doctors after multiple tests and ended up having major heart problems not long after. I know sometimes the internet can definitely fuel paranoia but I can't help but worry that everything I've been experiencing could be a precursor to a major problem.  Would you recommend I go for that echocardiogram or should I just leave it be at this point? Any other insight/opinions are welcome :-)\n\n",

    "content": "Just an update. The other week I got the results back from my tests. The holter came back normal. The doctor said my heart was a little slow and fast at times but that was normal and there were no arythmias. Also, my thyroid and cholesterol came back fine too. I'm not sure what else I can or should do. I am relieved these tests keep coming back fine, but I continue to worry that something is there but it's just not showing up on the tests for whatever reason. My blood pressure and heart rate continues to raise while I'm trying to fall asleep every night. The pain/discomfort is still as present as ever on the upper left hand side of my back. I still feel a tightness and slight pain there whenever I inhale deeply (this is from late July) Last night I was exercising (wasnt overexerting myself) and I had severe heart palps that took more than a half hour to go away. I'm not talking about normal elevated heart rate, my heart felt like it was pounding in my throat. I was so dizzy that I couldnt continue. Lately I've been getting very dizzy when I exercise so now thats something else to add to the list that I'm concerned with.    I really don't think I'm being a hypochondriac about this but maybe I am considering all of these these tests keep coming back normal.  If any expert is reading this, do any of these symptoms sound like they could be ANYTHING at all? I guess seeing s cardiologist is my next step but I've been trying to be smart about what tests to get and what doctors to see because I'm currently without insurance and the medical bills have been getting crazy lately :-/  And  mpmama294 thank you for replying. I have had anxiety issues in the past and have had anixety attacks a few times and although some of my symptoms are similar to anxiety, I really don't think that's what's been going on with me. I'm very familiar with what my anxiety feels like and this doesnt seem to be what's wrong with me. I just *feels* different and is much stronger and more persistant than any anxiety episode I've ever experienced. My anxiety is always triggered by something, but then it goes away minutes (or a little longer) later. With whatever has been going on with me lately, I could be sitting around cool as a cucumber not thinking of a thing or laughing watching something funny on tv or being out with my friends and certain symptoms will act up out of nowhere and sometimes last upwards of weeks.\n\n",

Further complications arose due to a severe steroid reaction when I suffered damage to my digestive system resulting in my vomiting a lot of red blood and by the time I was hospitalised I had brain swelling which caused me to become semi-conscious, lose my optical motor ability and so my eyes crossed, I also lost my senses of smell and taste, my balance and appetite and short-term memory. Eventually I made a great recovery but have continued to have a poor physique, no sense of smell, poor balance, little or no short-term memory and my original strength of will and focus is greatly diminished.  No complaints, I am great and delighted to be here thanks to the skills of all those who helped me. I have recently made another concerted effort to get myself fitter but my husband has noted that my restinging heart rate averages 120-125. However my blood pressure is excellent and only occasionally is low, i.e., 100/65-ish. I feel fine, no dizzy spells, no nausea and when I do a few minutes walking my blood pressure increases slightly and I feel a little sweaty but my heart rate drops slightly to 100-115. My husband wants me to see the doctor but I am phobic about that and would ask that given the above - could the high resting heart rate be due to my lack of fitness?  Thank you\n\n",

If your heart rate were elevated due to decreased fitness I would expect it to go up, not down with walking and exercise.  I would suggest that you see your doctor to have this evaluated.  You should probably have some screening labs done to evaluate your thyroid and other electrolytes.  Also, be sure you are well hydrated.  It may simply be that this is how fast your heart has decided it needs to beat now but it is best to be safe and have everything checked out to be sure.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi bbkoack, Many conditions may produce symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath from lung disorders, i.e.,asthma, COPD, emphysema, cardiac disorders, hematologic conditions, i.e. anemia, endocrine dysfunction, etc. Taking into consideration your age, and normal activity level, an that this is a new onset change, I would strongly encourage you to have an evaluation by your physician. Diagnostics, for example, labs, chest xray, etc. to identify the causative factor would likely be completed at that time as well. An update would be very much appreciate when your time permits. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "For a while now, i have had severe chest pain, lasting for only about a minute or so. A couple of days ago, i collapsed to the floor because the pain was horrible (but mostly, my left arm, of all places, started to hurt badly). I was brought to the ER, and when they checked my pulse and BP, it was through the roof, so the doc ordered all sorts of tests, but nothing showed up. He told me that everything is normal, but i still get the pains and when i not doing any activity whatsoever.   Is that normal? Is it possible that there could be other causes? I'm 20 years old and no one i know has had any of the following symptoms which is what really gets me all worried.\n\n",

    "content": "You said something was \"through the roof\" - did you mean your blood pressure?  If so, then everything was not fine. If you mean that the blood pressure was high but then back to normal, it is possible you had some kind of transient situation that caused strange symptoms but has not been repeated so it is impossible to diagnose.  I would get a follow up appointment with your regular doctor but if it never happens again you may never know what caused this.  As smart as we are and with all the technology we have, there are still some things that are unexplained.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "For the past week i have had a sharp pain as well as dull pain  extending out, the pain is nearly in the middle of my chest but about an inch towards my right side. Pain goes from there and in under my right breast up high , and under my armpit.  Sometimes the pain radiates from the front of the chest to my shoulder at the back. The pain seems to get worse when i am stressed or doing anything physical.  I am tired all the time and it feels like someone is sitting on my chest.  My question is should i be concerned about these symtoms? As i don't know wether it is common to have these symtoms with my heart being where it is or not.    32 years old, female  Had a ecg years ago because of pains in the chest, was told that my heart faces the wrong way, that where there should be up pins there is down pins on the readout, and the readout comes out as left reading right, and right reading left like the wires are attached to the wrong sides.  Nothing else was done.  There is heart disease and high blood pressure in my family.\n\n",

Chest pain in a young menstruating female is less likely to be due to heart disease - however we have a great article written by one of our cardiologists, Dr. Madia that addresses the various causes of chest pain in young females.  To view it please click here!   I think given the exertional nature of your symptoms, and the fact that they have lasted for a week that you should seek medical attention if you are still experiencing them.

Once the heart has been ruled out as the cause you can try various treatments for gastritis, etc. until you are able to find a way to relieve your symptoms (acid blockers, etc.).  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Good evening!  21 year old female, I neither smoke nor drink, and I'm not overweight. I do not have children.   I'm currently on Vesicare (light dosage) for urinary frequency/incontinence.  Family history: my grandfather died of heart failure at 85, my other grandfather of AIDS. My grandmother (84) has a slight heart arrhythmia (atrial?), but is otherwise very healthy. My other grandmother suffers from rheumatoid arhtritis.  I have a history of sudden and transitory tachycardias (usually because of anxiety/panick attacks), as well as fainting and drop in blood pressure. Also, recent onset of migraines following minor head trauma (clear MRI and neurological exam).  Recently (5 days ago), I developed chest and back pain. Sometimes sharp and localized, sometimes a dull ache; generally affecting my sternum and left-side of my chest, as well as my back and shoulders. I'd say the pain ranges from a 2 to a 4.  I also have sudden fits of severe coughing (trying to cough up phlegm: clear, no blood, but abundant), that come and go. Usually that makes the chest pain more severe.  Today, I had two episodes of palpitations: a sudden and brief awareness of my heartbeat, faster than usual and pounding in my neck. After that I felt rather lightheaded and very tired. That said, I didn't faint or sweat, and when the doctor took my pulse afterwards it was normal (70). My BP as well was normal (12/7, my normal range).  Later, I went to see a doctor (nightshift), who told me I had a respiratory infection (mild fever) which explained my cough, and in turn my chest pain. He took my pulse and blood pressure (normal), listened to my breathing. As for the palpitations, he chalked them up to dehydration and general fatigue. (I was thirsty and a bit tired, that's true.)   I admit, I'm a bit perplexed. I'm reluctant to go back to the hospital, because I'm afraid to be an overreacting hypocondriac (many deaths in my family, and many doctors too), but at the same time, I felt as though the doctor really dismissed my concerns. (As a side-note, I live in Japan, so English-speaking doctors are a rarity).  I'd appreciate your opinion. Thank you for taking the time to answer our questions, by the way!\n\n",

In your case, since they are occuring more when the heart rate increases I would suggest you discuss this with your doctor.  You may need to have an exercise stress test to see what happens to your heart rhythm when you have an increased pulse.  The concern is that when more PVC's occur with exercise they may lead to a more dangerous rhythm.  If the PVC's occur less with exercise than when at rest they are much less concerning.

    "content": "I am a 20 year old white female. Never smoked, don't drink, and exercise. I am 5'5 and 161 lbs, currently losing weight to keep healthy. I am on no medications, but used birth control for less than 6 months about a full year ago. I was adopted from birth, so my medical history is mostly unknown. The few listed conditions on adoption records indicated family history of slightly enlarged heart, depression, non-seizure epilepsy, and low blood pressure. Only surgery I have ever had was an adenoidectomy six years ago.  In high school (2001-2005), within a two year period I passed out five times. Each time I felt mild dizziness and felt as if my heart skipped a beat and then sped up. I was evaluated after the second episode, where the doctor told me it could be hypoglycemia, but that there was no way to test for it (though later I found out there is a glucose test). However she ordered an EKG and EEG, both of which came back normal. I followed the recommended diet and timing for eating, but I still passed out later that year. I went back for evaluation after the fourth or fifth one, where a different physician from the same practice asked me if I had the internet at home and when I said yes, he wrote \"vasovagal syncope\" on a prescription slip and gave it to me, without a real explanation of what it was, and no tests done to diagnose it. I've since switched medical offices.  I went home and researched it, but didn't find alot of concrete information on it.  Since graduating high school and starting college, I regularly donate blood, where my blood pressure is taken prior to the donation. It consistently reads at about 100/60. The last time I passed out, I was at a store, so they called EMS, who came and took my blood pressure sitting and standing. When I stood, it dropped significantly, but I felt no symptoms.  I haven't passed out since graduating, but I have come close a few times, relieving the feeling by drinking water, eating, and sitting with my head between my legs, all at the same time. I have randomly had the same feeling of my heart seemingly stopping and catching up, causing me to catch my breath. It happens both when I'm active and when I'm not. It's so sporadic that I have my doubts as to whether even a holter monitor would pick it up, though I've never had that test.  My question is whether this is something that I should pursue with a physician more aggressively or if it is something to not really be concerned about. I have absolutely no idea if it is in fact vasovagal syncope or a cardiac condition of some sort. I would like a second opinion. Any ideas as to what's going on?  Any information or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Karouni,  This sounds like a very typical scenario. There is a condition called neurocardiogenic syncope.  It is often referred to as vasovagal syncope but is actually a little different.  Commonly this is triggered by standing for a prolonged period of time or standing up rapidly.  Basically what is thought to happen is that the heart contains primitive nerve fibers that keep the heart from beating too fast.  When a person stands for a long time, or gets up from a seated position the initial reaction is that the blood starts to sink to the legs.  Before the blood vessels can respond appropriately the heart rate increases to compensate for the lower blood pressure.  This part of the response is normal and appropriate.  However, in some people, when the heart rate speeds up (like it should), these primitive fibers sense the increased heart rate and think it is too fast so they slow the heart rate down.  When this happens, blood flow is not sufficient to get to the brain enough and the person passes out.  Subsequently, blood flow is restored and everything goes back to normal.  This is not particularly dangerous, unless the person gets hurt when passing out.  Having your blood pressure drop when you stand is a predisposing factor to having this happen.  Also, it tends to be common in young women.    Before medications are used, there are some other things you can try to see if it will help.  Basically, you want to stay very well hydrated. The goal should be to drink enough water to keep your urine colorless (i.e. no yellow).  You can also try increasing the salt in your diet a little to help keep the fluid in your blood vessels better.    If this keeps happening I would recommend you see a cardiologist.  There is a test that can be done to confirm this diagnosis called a tilt table test that cardiologists perform.  If the events occur frequently enough there are some mediations to help block the nerve fibers from causing the heart slowing.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 35 yo female.  For the last 4 days I have intermittently experienced a tingling chest pain on the left side of my chest (almost on my side near bottom of breast) that will feel like it is radiating up the left side of my neck and to the back of my head.  It only lasts for a few seconds to a couple minutes and then I feel fine.  No problems breathing (although I did have a very nasty cold about 6 weeks ago, and still have a lingering cough from it).  I am resting when it happens and have not experienced it while I am moving around.  I am not on any medications.  My most recent blood pressure was 140/82 while I was at the oral surgeons in July 2007, although this is the highest it has ever been.  In April I was refused from the blood center because my iron level was too low.  I am overweight (5' 5\", 290 lbs) and am therefore concerned of this possibly stemming from my weight.  I am very concerned as it has been four days and is still happening.  Should I see my family dr or is this something that could go away with time?  Thank you very much for any insight anyone could provide me.\n\n",

At the same time, disc problems of the neck can sometimes lead to dermatomal pain and tingling in the chest and can be accompanied by pain in the neck.

    "content": "I'm an 18-year-old male with a family that has a history of heart disease and strokes. For the past 2 weeks, I've had heart palpitations almost 24/7. There isn't really any pain present.. just the constant awareness of my heart beating at a relatively normal rate. I've done some research and have read this could be a symptom of congenital heart failure, coronary heart disease, heart attacks, etc. and am starting to get pretty paranoid. On some instances, it seems like the palpitations are accompanied by shortness of breath, which may just be the result of my paranoia. I know this sounds ridiculous but i just have this feeling in the back of my head that I could drop dead at any second. I'm not extremely active or inactive, extremely healthy or unhealthy.. not obese, just a normal teen. My parents are the type to freak out over small issues, so i haven't told them or seen a doctor. I would rather find out first if this could be something potentially serious or if it's just induced by stress or some negligible factor that will go away over time. Also (and i'm not sure if it's related or not) but i've had a strange burping sensation in my esophagus for some time now.. which i'm less concerned about. Any advice or help you can give me would be hugely appreciated... I don't like worrying about death and heart problems at such a young age :(\n\n",

It is a fact that teens are overlooked in this important area.  It is good to discuss any concerns with a doctor at that time.   This can include adult immunization recommendations, acne, growth, hormonal changes, sexuality, decisions about future, mental health issues, etc.  During this exam you can bring up any questions you have about the symptoms you have noticed.  Then the doctor can address these as well.    I hope you will do this and would encourage any young adults to do the same.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Redsfan78,  This sounds a little like a syndrome called Precordial Catch Syndrome.  Basically, all of a sudden a person may develop severe sharp pain that only lasts for a second or two, often making it difficult to breath for a moment.  Some describe the pain as if something got caught in their chest causing pain then suddenly released and the pain went away.  This is where the name comes from.  No one really knows what causes this syndrome although I suspect it is a form of pleurisy.  Pleurisy is inflammation of the lung/chest wall lining.    This pain is very unlikely to be related directly to the heart as heart pain is usually more of a severe pressure/diffuse type chest pain rather than a sharp pain.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Heres a few facts cause I read also some (maybe) causes for this... I drink a cup of coffee bout once a day and maybe three out seven days a week I'll drink 2 cups (doesn't sound excessive but maybe worth mentioning), I am a first year nursing student and work at a hospital as a nurse assistant (and both are stressful) and 22 years old female on no medications.   But anytime I have an episode is when Im just sitting, very calm and then all of a sudden I can feel it just pounding. Once this past summer I was sitting in class and suddenly felt incredible pain (not the racing but just pain) in my chest and it was over in just a few seconds, I haven't felt the pain though since then. I'm adopted so I have no idea if heart problems/disease runs in my family. Again I did get some answers on here about the caffeine and stress factors but would still like a response to mine specifically. thanks for taking the time\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Babineau,  PFO's are actually relatively common.  They are the remnants of a hole that was open before birth to allow some of the blood to bypass the lungs since they were not being used.  At birth, the foramen ovale closes.  When it remains slightly open it is referred to as a patent foramen ovale or PFO.    The blood flow across a PFO is generally quite small.  I would not expect it to be enough to cause elevated pulmonary pressures.  In your case, with the echo saying suspicious of a PFO it is even more likely that the amount of blood flow is minimal.  If it were a lot, the report would not really have been suspicious.  I would recommend you continue to follow up with your cardiologist to try to determine the cause of your pulmonary hypertension.

    "content": "Hello. I'm a 23 year old male, have MVP, GERD, small Atrial Septal Defect, and TMJ. No surgeries, no family history of heart problems, and am currently taking 10mg Lexapro, 20mg Prilosec, and 10mg Inderal (to help with anxiety) once a day, as well as currently tapering off of Lamictal.   My problem is as follows. For the last several days I've been experiencing intermittent pain in my left shoulder which has now turned into pain in my left arm. Along with this I've been having pain in my chest (usually on my left side) and really bad fatigue. And also shortness of breath as well. All this occurs at rest, as well as seemingly getting worse with exertion (the shortness of breath moreso than the pain). It is becoming quite worrisome. In addition, lately I've had a few episodes where my pulse is so strong I can feel it throughout my entire body, especially when I lay down. In the past three years I've had numerous EKG's, a stress test, an echo, more bloodwork than I can count, and most recently a spirometry test, all which have come back normal. I know I have anxiety issues, but I'm reluctant to chalk this up to that. The shortness of breath in particular worries me, because the spirometry test came back okay, which makes me think that maybe it's heart related and not lung related. The shoulder pain worries me as well, because it's not affected by movement, which I've read means it's referred pain. I know it seems silly to worry so much about all this, since the only real risk factors I have are being male and smoking. Otherwise I'm thin (132 pounds...lost 8 pounds in the last month actually, for no apparent reason), have good cholesterol (102, I believe), have fairly normal blood pressure (116/67, last time I had it checked), and don't have a family history of heart problems.   I guess what I'd like to know is...Is there any chance at all that any/all this could be heart related?  I'm awfully worried about something like heart failure (acute moreso than chronic) or things like that. Any sort of suggestion on what could be causing any of these problems would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi SeraphisCain,  In general, heart problems are uncommon in a man your age.  However, uncommon things do happen.  Your description is consistent with heart pain so I would advise you to see your doctor to discuss these symptoms.  You may need some repeat testing.  I think it is unlikely to be acute heart failure.  Your symptoms are more suggestive of the heart not getting enough oxygen, which causes the pain referred to as angina.  There are certainly other possible causes, including reflux; however, with the heart it is best to be safe and have this evaluated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Female - 26 pain in right shoulder that runs down arm",
    "content": "I am a 26 year old female who has been having pain in my right shoulder that runs down my right arm on and off for a month now.  The pain is very sharp and feels like it is deep in my shoulder, possibly in my veins, and runs down my arm, but the bulk of the pain is in my shoulder under my shoulder blade.  This pain does not respons to pain relievers and I have not had any trauma to my shoulder in any way. There also doesn't seem to be a trigger to this pain at all, it comes and goes, but usually last for over 24 hours.  The pain also varies in strength and will be very strong for a couple hours, making me not even want to move, and then it will wain slightly for a few hours.   I have had a similiar feeling before (but a lot less painful) when I drink certain drinks, like Skyy Blue, which is similar to the Smirnoff Ice products.  I rarely drink and normally just stop drinking if I feel this reaction.  Because of this for a short time I thought it was related to the benadryl I was taking for allergies but the pain has come back even though I stopped taking the drug (or any other medicines.)   I have no idea what this or if I should be seriously worried or not?  It is extremely painful sometimes and I've examined everything I do, eat and drink it doesn't seem to be caused by anything I am doing.  I would appreciate any help I can get as to an idea of what this may be.  Thank you very much for your time.\n\n",

What you are describing sounds like you are having nerve pain, probably from the brachial plexus that is located in the armpit area.    There are a few conditions, such as having an extra cervical rib that can irritate the plexus and cause pain.  You may need to have some imaging studies, like an MRI, of the area to see what is going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am trying to understand bpm. What is though of as a fast heart rate in the average 35 yo male.(still trying to quit smoking but havent made it yet)  Why I ask is I usually run between 80 to 100 bpm during the day. I do have anx disorder and agoraphobia so my doc put me on atenolol to calm the bpm down. When I am taking the med on a daily basis my bpm usually falls around 50-60 bpm but my blood pressure also goes low usually 100/60. This is with taking a 1/4 of a 20 mg pill 2 times a day. When it drops low I feel like heck. I took the med for 2 weeks like the doc said to let my body adjust and I had to stop it because I felt so bad, tired, shaky, lack of motivation etc. It also really didn't do much for my anx except make me just want to sleep. 3 days after stopping the med I feet much better but my bpm has increased back to its usual 80 to 100  again. If I understand correctly epinephrine causes increased heart rate as well as increased blood pressure. Is this right? because my doc said it was adrenalyn (sp) causing my fast beat. So im a little confused. Over the last 3 days my highest bpm was 106 and my pressure was 129/81. The other 4 bp tests I have taken since stopping the atenolol averaged high 120's over 80. (during the day) Are there anyother meds I can suggest to my doctor that might help slow my heart rate down or is my bpm not to bad just a little on the high side.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi JRM,  A normal heart rate for an average 35 year old would be 60-100.  Most people will be in the 60-80 range.  Based on these numbers you are giving you appear  to be running in the high normal range.  Your blood pressures, as well, appear to be high normal.  I would suggest you talk with your doctor about these numbers and discuss the risks/benefits of using medications to bring your heart rate down.  It may be that the side effects of the medicine are not worth the benefits.    Also, adrenaline and epinephrine are synonymous.    Best wishes.\n\n",

He said we could try some different meds to lower my bpm and bp but since I was taking such a low dose of the atenolol and it was really hard on me he is unsure on what the next batch of meds will do. He thinks once I get my anxiety under control both bp and bpms will calm down, he also wants me to up my clonazepam dosage just a little bit to see if that helps. I mentioned to him I posted my question here and he suggested that I ask if any of the cartio specialists here could suggest a med (herbal or rx). Thankyou for you assistance\n\n",

The walk lasted until 11:30 a.m.  Afterwards my husband (27 y.o. healthy, but extremely bad vericose veins) kept complaining of chest pain.  We ate at 4:30, afterwards he layed down to take a nap.  When he awoke 3 hrs. later he complained of his chest pain again, so we took his blood pressure, which was, if I am correct 140/100.  I know that whatever it was it was extremely high.  We were up and ready to go to the ER, when his mother said that he was fine.  While he was standing his aunt, who overlooks our hospitals ECO Cardiogram, took his BP again, said that is was still high, but that now his pulse was racing.  She suggested that he go to the ER along with everyone else, but because his mother said that he was fine he didn't go.  Almost everyone in his family has high blood pressure, hypertension, his grandma even has a pacemaker!!  I am so upset!  I am looking on the internet and the word that keeps popping up with these symptoms is Angina, and that while you are experiencing the chest pain is when the EKG should be performed.  This happens to him everytime he over exerts himself.  I am scared that they are early warning signs of an upcoming heart attack that will leave me single, with our 2 1/2 yr old daughter.  Please help me!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Turtlesti,  You may be experiencing PVC's (premature ventricular contractions).  When this happens, the heart beats early so there is a longer than normal pause after this until the next heart beat.  The long pause allows the heart to fill with more blood than normal that, in turn, causes a stronger heart beat than the previous ones.  PVC's are quite common and often are not dangerous.  However, if you are noticing these happening more often it is a good idea to have this evaluated just to be sure.  Your primary doctor can do an ECG to look at the rhythm and see if there is anything that requires an evaluation by a cardiologist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have been having chest pains for a possibly 2 months on and off, though of late they are far worse, and more often.  Last week, while my wife was in A&E having stitches in her hand, i fainted. Now not wanting to prove my manliness, this was not due to the sights or anything like that. i had cleaned her up, bandaged her and watched them stitch her. We were actually on our way out when i fainted. I knew for possibly 5 mins before that i was not well. i had ecg done, which they said came as abnormal, then said it was nothing to worry about so that confused me to start.  My fathers side of the family has terrible heart history my grandfather had a heart attack at 40, and died at 55 from another. my father had his at 42 and after many problems was solved to this day by inserting stents   the pain i have now has been for the past 3 days almost constant. a dull feeling in the middle of my breastbone, like someone leaning on me. Ive also had pain in my shoulder blades at times. The biggest worry is a feeling in my chest, i cant really describe, its as if there is a flutter of wind and a feeling of something about to happen with great speed, like a build up of something, that doesn't happen.  I had blood tests done while in A&E and nothing came up.  Im seeing my Dr tomorrow and have no idea what i should expect, or ask about etc   im really quite worried now after finding out my family history.   i know its hard to give a medical opinion from words, but does the above ring any bells?  many thanks  martin\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 40 y/o woman in general good health.  Blood pressure, cholesterol & CBP all normal.  On may 12th I woke up feeling dizzy & noticed my heart was beating  out of rythym.  fast, then slow, then hard pounding beats, then skipped beats, then double beats.  I also had pain in my chest in the heart area.  I thought I was having a heart attack.  I went to the ER and they hooked me to the heart monitor and did all kinds of blood work and said they found nothing and I was likely having a panick attack which I never had in my life.  I followed up with my PCP who did more blood work and still found nothing.  Every day since that day I have had moderate to very extreme chest pain in the left side in the heart area.  I saw a cardiologist who did a stress test and echo and a halter monitor and said I had a lot of skipped beats but that should not be the cause of my chest pain.  The pain worsened and from May 12th through early July i had massive chest pain all day every day right in my heart and nothing was diagnosed.  I saw a neurologist, an endocrinologist, a pulmonoligist, a gastrointerologist, a rheumatologist - no diagnosis.  Finally the cardiologist did an angiogram and said my heart was perfect - as healthy as it could possibly be.  Still only the diagnosis of skipped beats and extra beats.  Primary care doctor took the \"anxiety\" path and put me on zoloft and xanax and no relief.  Its been 4 months - my life is ruined.  I live in constant pain all day, all night with no diagnosis. Occasionally, it goes away for a few hours and during that time I remember what its like to live normal again, but then it comes back.  Its always worse at night - I wake up  every 30 to 60 minutes in massive pain.  I am so sleep deprived.  I was treated for Gerd with no relief and do not have a hernia.  Exercise or movement does not make it better or wose - its always the same.  Im afraid to be alone, don't want to be far from home and am terrified that every day is going to be my last.  I'm in counseling learning biofeedback and even the therapist believes the pain is not caused by anxiety, but rather the anxiety is caused by the pain - but what is the cause. Any ideas?  Please help.  I'm a single mom of two and I feel like i'm a prisoner of pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lmfclcl,  Unfortunately, I can't explain your symptoms.  I wish I could.  I do have a thought about a possible treatment for your pain.  If you have not tried this yet you may want to talk with your doctor about using ibuprofen as an anti-inflammatory and taking it on a regular, scheduled basis 3-4 times per day for a week.  If there is an inflammatory component it may help suppress the inflammation and pain.  You may also want to try a medicine that is more aimed at nerve type pain.  An example of this medicine is a seizure medicine called gabapentin (brand name Neurontin).  While it is actually a seizure medicine, it often can have significant impact on controlling pain that is being caused by nerve problems.  (Not nerves as in anxiety but pain from nerve inflammation or other issues.)  I hope this helps some.  Hang in there.  Often, the answers to these problems become more apparent over time.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Cavadan,  Pregnancy can increase the risk of blood clots some but for most people this is not an issue.  In your case, since you developed a clot I would suggest you see a hematologist to be evaluated for a condition that would make you at more risk of clotting.  Some possible conditions that would do this are Factor V Liedin, Prothrombin 20210 mutation, Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and Lupus anticoagulant.  Your chest pains may be due to a condition called pleurisy, which is inflammation of the lining of the lungs/chest wall.  Typically this pain is worsened by deep breaths.  You may also want to ask your doctor about the possibility of systemic lupus erythematosus.  SLE can be associated with hypercoagulation (via the antiphospholipids) and pleurisy as well as other possible causes of the chest pain.  It is most commonly diagnosed in women in their young childbearing age (late teens to early twenties).  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Chest Pain",
    "content": "Hello:    I am a 45 yr old male with a history of high blood pressure & high cholesterol and a family history of heart disease. Recently whenever I am extremely irritated or angry, I have felt an intense almost cramp like pain in my chest.  This stops me in my tracks and when I calm down the pain subsides. However I have a residual soreness/tingling in my chest and left arm for several hours afterwords. I have had 2 such episodes in the past 6 months. I am currently on norvac and zocor. I have had two stress tests in the past 3 years (the treadmill ones) and pass each one with flying colors. I have never had these episodes triggered by exercise only by being very angry or upset.  I visited my doctor after the first episode, and he did not think it was heart related but rather digestive related /heartburn sort of thing.  I believe he feels I'm a hypochondriac. However the pain I experience is real and not like anything I've ever experienced before.  My question is what does this sound like? How concerned should I be? And what is my next step in determining what is going on?  thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Your doctor may be right - you could have esophogeal reflux because the symptoms you describe could fit this scenario.  Stomach acid is VERY strong and if it splashes up into your esophagus, the result can be very painful as well as damaging to the tissues.  Intense feelings can also alter stomach acid and trigger such a response.    Of course it could also fit other disorders, such as panic attacks.  Given the identifiable trigger is anger, either scenario is possible.  Our bodies have their own ways of protecting themselves and when you find yourself in \"fight or flight\" mode, all kinds of physical symptoms can appear intensely and very suddenly.  When breathing is affected there is also the possibility it could be lung related or involving the chest wall muscle and/or ribs.  Pericarditis (inflammation of the outer sac lining of the heart) is also a possibility.    This is not all-inclusive.  Other disorders could also cause your symptoms.  Stay with your doctor until you get a satisfactory answer or until it gets better on its own.    I would not get overly worried about this unless it gets markedly worse or it feels like a heart attack  - pressure, squeezing or dull ache felt in the center of the chest (not actually over the heart) that is usually brought on with exertion and relieved by rest and possibly radiating to neck, back, arm, abdomen.  I know you have said exercise does not bring this on but it is something to be alert to.   Meanwhile, follow your doctor's advice in observing for possible causes, treating stomach acid, etc.    Best wishes\n\n",

If the shortness of breath continues, I would consult a doctor but it may be a bit of a panicky feeling happening related to your decision to quit smoking.  By the way, don't be mislead about filters if they are attached to the cigarettes.  The marketing makes it sound like they are safer, but there are so many poisons involved, this is a mere drop in the bucket.  The kind of filter prescribed by a doctor and which you add with each cigarette can help reduce the nicotine consumed and help with the withdrawal symptoms.  If you would like more information to help you quit, contact the American Lung Association (also on the net).  Your local health department may also offer assistance, counseling and even medications to help.    Good luck with this.\n\n",

The cold beverage may have caused some stimulation of the vagal nerve that runs near the esophagus.  This could cause some initial slowing of the heart rate with a secondary tachycardia to compensate.  (This is a bit of a stretch but possible.)  Seeing your cardiologist will be helpful for you.

Symptom free until 3 mos. ago since which time I have experienced several episodes of exercise induced, right side chest pain. Each event follows only 10 to 20 mins. of light excertion, characterized by a ballooning feeling of pain and moderate burn very localized in an area of my right chest just right of the sternum. Onset appeared to be correlated with increased BP as was finally clinically documented in a pulmonology stress test - recommended meds change to lower the BP with no resultant diagnosis of the chest pain. In each case, tingling down the right arm but pain always subsided shortly after discont.activity followed by a lingering, mild burning and irritation in upper chest. To date, a heart cath, nuclear perfusion, pulmonological stress test, cardiac enzyms, and chest CT are all negative. After a change in meds two weeks ago from 240 verapamil, to  5 mg norvasc and 50 mg altenolol, another pronounced episode occurred today during a 20 minute walk. I'm concerned by Docs. may be missing a peripheral coronary arterial or even a semi-labile pulmonary issue.  Any thoughts on a diagnosis would be greatly appreciated!  fishfarmer\n\n",

I would have expected that if it were a problem with compromised blood flow there would have been some changes on the stress EKG.  Also, I would have expected a blockage big enough to be significant to show up on catheterization.  My best advice for you is to continue to follow up with your cardiologist.  Yo may need a repeat stress EKG to see if there are any new changes.  If you begin developing severe chest pain or shortness of breath you should be seen by a doctor right away.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Heres my run down, Male, 35, dad has low BP and only 3 heart valves,  mother has High BP, both are in their 80's. I suffer from agoraphobia and panic attacks. The last fiew days have been bad with having a hard heart beat and mild chest pains (in left side breast near harm pit) I havent been abol to make it back to my GP because of my phobias but we do comunicate on a daily basis and I have been sending him a monthly log of my symptons and my medication dosages and intervuls. Heres my question I have been taking 1/4 pill of clnoazepam (1mg pill) once a day for the last 4 months. Prior to that I was taking 1/2 pill once a day. Last week I was suspose to see the doc (never made it chickened out) and I upped my dose back to 1/2 pill the following day my hard heart beats returned (sofar max bpm has been 108) the following day they calmed down and everything was back to normal. This past week I did the same thing and still couldnt make it back to the doc but I did send him my monthly log. That eve he called me asked what I thought the chest pains were from ? (had me confused so I replied what I thought, and that was from either anxiety or over working my chest muscles, I do alot of physical work druing the day) and wants me to take Atenolol for a fiew days to see if it drops my heart rate. .25mg pill cut in 1/2 3 times a day. Well the hard hart beat and palps have returned friday and have not given me an inch of rest. Followed by chest pains and left arm feeling funky (no other word for it) I called the doc but he is out till wed. and I am getting nervous is it a heart prroblem or an anxiety flair up. I have never had them last for 3 days. My BP has only maxed out at 129/89 pls 108 but usually runs around 122/75 pls 79-88 during the day. In the am just waking 116/77 54bpm, Usually when it is that low during the day I feel like a sloth. I read up on the beta blockers and they say they do drop the bpm but also they drop blood pressure.  From what I read on the web (probably not a good thing for me) I fall into the average or normals. I am not question my doc but I am worried that the Atenolol might mask a problem or make me feel worse then I already do. Or is it my body is thinking it is going trought withdrawals from the clonazepam. Or is there something else. My last EKG was 4 years ago and at that time everything checked fine, I know alot can change in a year. In april they did a full blood workup and after 3 vials of blood all the tests came back normal. Sorry if I am running on just trying to cover all the info bases sorta speak.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - It is difficult to get a fix on the effectiveness of your meds as you use such small doses. However, you are correct in your observation that your vital signs all fall within the normal range, especially for one with chronic anxiety/agoraphobia, which is most certainly your most important problem at present.   While you said you are taking 1/2 a 25 mg atenolol tablet, which is a low dose, you are taking that 3 times per day if I read your post right. That would mean you are taking a total of 37.5 mg per day. Since atenolol is a drug normally taken once in 24 hours, you are actually getting a decent dose, so your perception that all drugs are less effective for you may not be true in all cases, as the atenolol is still not overriding the amount of adrenaline you are generating because of your anxiety level. Then again, you take a miniscule dose of clonazepam (a drug which works great along with a beta blocker for your kind of chronic anxiety). Your body could be reacting to the low dose by not doing much of anything new. This could be the answer to your question. I would add, however, for what it's worth, that nothing new or worrisome seems to have evolved either. Your chronic level of anxiety is rather high, and that's where the real attention needs to be focused. The chest pains you describe are classic for generalized anxiety and not at all like cardiac pains, so hopefully that wiill be of some reassurance to you.  By all means try and work your way outside and to the doctor's office. I know how difficult this can be, but it is essential that you not self-medicate and that you be certain you're taking the drugs as prescribed. Besides, every trip out to somewhere is a step toward your ultimate freedom from agoraphobia. You're too young to be trapped that way.   Best of luck to you and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

I have been only taking 1 -1/2 pill a day sofar, and only taking 1/4 pill of the clonazepam a day. Both at seperate times. He also said just keep checking my BP for the next fiew days If it doesnt go below 100/60 or my pulse rate doesnt drop below 50 bpm Then keep what I am doing and slowly increase my dosage till I come close to those numbers at rest first thing in the morning. I checked my BP first thing this morning just after waking and it was 114/78 pls was 59 so I think I might just keep at the 1/2 pill a day and see how my body adjusts.\n\n",

Seeing your doctor about this is important to see if any specific treatment is needed for it.  Sometimes the pressure is slightly elevated but not enough to need treatment.  In these cases it is followed closely.  Other times treatment is indicated.  The pericardial effusion, if minimal, will likely resolve on its own.  It can be caused by many different causes, including viral infections.  It is likely that this will be followed without treatment to make sure it is getting better.  The cardiologist will be able to tell you much more about your condition.  Follow up is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

When you describe them pulsing at varying heights in the neck it may be that you are seeing the jugular vein.  This can be a sign of heart failure.

    "content": "Hi,  Please could anyone help me? Im a 23 year old male, and i have always been very fit and healthy. I  have never had any previous health issues.  About 6 months ago i noticed a flutter in my chest which is difficult to describe - like a localised rush of adrenaline where my heart is, which lasts for just a second or so and happens maybe 2-3 times a day. Soon after, In addition to the flutters i became very aware of my heart and can often feel it thumping (like its beating harder than normal). Recently i have had a mild ache in my left arm/shoulder too! I don't feel dizzy, breathless or have significant chest pain when symptoms occur and my ECG, Echo, X-Ray and Blood test are apparently all normal. It doesnt seem to be effected by alcohol, caffeine or exercise either. However, im certain that there's something wrong, and its not just anxiety, and its worrying me so much that its taking over my life.   Can anyone offer any advice? It would be very much appreciated\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mnqcljsm,  What you are experiencing may be a heart rhythm called supraventricular tachycardia.  The ECG may be normal if not done during one of these episodes.  You may need to have a holter monitor test done.  This is basically a 24 hour ECG that can hopefully document the heart rhythm during one of the episodes.  This is the best way to find out what the heart is doing when you feel the fluttering.  Usually a cardiologist orders one of these although your primary care doctor may also be able to do this.

A heart block is another possibility but this doesn't usually present this way.  I would suggest you see a cardiologist to get an EKG and possible a holter monitor (a prolonged EKG) to try to catch the heart rhythm during one of these episodes.  Most of the possible heart causes can be treated with medications or other treatments once the diagnosis is made.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Last year i needed to phone a out of hours doctor. My symptoms were shortness of breath,rapid pulse,lights outside were bleary,i was hot but shivering at the same time and i felt i was going to pass out.My teeth were also chattering.It felt like shock.Then when i laid on the sofa my legs started jerking.Over the phone medical advice was to take a beta blocker which i did.It was realy frightening i thought i was going to die.The doctor arrived 3 hours later and said he thought it was a panic attack. Later on in the year i had a real rapid pulse for no reason and again felt i was going to pass out. I also had the heavy pressure like feeling on the top of my left breast where the heart is. I was sent for a ecg which came back normal. In the past 2 weeks the pressure like feeling has returned and is there most of the time like a heavy crushing feeling.It is there when i am at rest so i don`t think it is to do with anxiety. I am going to see a doctor asap but any information as to what my condition could be would be realy helpful as my doctor in the uk could miss diagnose my condition. Thankyou.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Chucky83,  There are a few possibilities.  Anxiety can definitely cause symptoms like you are describing.  Essentially this is a panic attack.  It can occur without warning and often is accompanied by feelings of dread or fear.  The anxiety causes adrenaline to be released.  The adrenaline then causes the heart to race, the palms to get sweaty and the other symptoms to occur.  Another possibility is that you are having episodes of too low blood pressure.  In response, the heart speeds up.  The low blood pressure can make a person feel dizzy or get light headed.  It can also induce seizures.  Hyperthyroidism can cause some of these symptoms also.  This can be tested for with a simple blood test.  Having a thorough physical exam can help guide the work up for this so seeing your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My mom is 62 Female the only past diagnoses was she is borderline diabetic She has had no past surgeries. and im not sure of all the family history all I know is her father died of a blood clot that traveled to his heart. She is on no current meds but she does take a number of vitamins every day.  My mother hates to go to the Dr. and she prefers to do things  naturally if she can but she will go to a Dr. when there is no natural fix or she does not know what the problem is.  She is very active so much that she runs circles around me and most others, but lately every time she eats food and it does not matter what kind sweet, healthy, salty she will fall asleep within 20 min for about an hour this has become such a problem for her that she now avoids eating during the day and tries to only eat dinner so that it does not interfere with her daily activity. This worries me as I think she should be eating more.  Yesterday she took a potassium pill in the morning with the rest of her vitamins  she  said this is something she had not taken for a couple of months. Yesterday she ate 3 times and never once fell asleep now she is concerned that is is lack of oxygen to the brain somehow and the potassium is what helped her.  My question is could she be right? or could it be something more being as she is after all 62? I have talked her in to going to the Dr. next week I hope he can tell us something that helps. what do you think?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kconner,  HOCM is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.  Other cases are from spontaneous mutations of the involved genes.  With autosomal dominant inheritance there is essentially a 50% chance that any children could have the disease.  It is for this reason that it is recommend that all direct relatives be screened.  If it has not appeared in the parents it is less likely to appear in the grandchildren as it would be presumed that the parents did not get the affected gene and they are spared the disease.  An exception would be that the parent may not have developed symptoms yet and may still be able to pass on the gene.  So, there are a few ways to look at it.  If the child's parents do not have the disease the chances of it being passed on it is small so the grandchild may not need to be screened.  On the other hand it is perfectly reasonable to have the child screened also since it is relatively simple.    Really, it comes down to your comfort level with the risk.  The risk is low but some people need to know.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Young Lad,  You don't give us your age but based upon your name I am presuming you are young.  It is very unlikely for young people to actually have any problems with their heart.  Your symptoms do sound consistent with panic attacks.  There are a few medications that can better treat panic attacks if the propranolol is not helping.  I would encourage you to let your doctor know about any medications or other substances you are/were using.  This information can be vital to making a correct diagnosis.  Keep in mind that your doctor is not out to judge you and is most concerned with your health.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  If there is a chance of heart problems they should be evaluated since being young is, unfortunately, not a guarantee of no heart problems.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I am a 29 Year Old male. Here are my symptoms:  I have been having a pain on my left side chest around my nipple area. It also affects me on the left shoulder blade. It feels like a sharp pain that kind of pulses.Sometimes, it will go away for a short time, then return. I had chest xrays, and they were clean. I also had an ekg and it was also good. I had bloodwork and it came back clear. The pain seems to increase when I lay down. When I breathe, it worsens just a little. It feels more like tightness when I breathe real deep. The pain is at its least when I am standing. Sometimes the pain radiates lower below my nipple area.  Can someone please give me an idea, so I can sleep easy again?  Thanks so Much, FCB\n\n",

    "content": "Hi FloridaCountryBoy,  There are a few possibilities.  With you saying that breathing makes it worse, pleurisy is a possibility.  This is a condition where the lining of the lungs/chest wall becomes inflamed.  It can be quite painful.  Another possibility is costochondritis.  This is a condition where the cartilage portion of the rib becomes inflamed.  This pain is usually made worse by pressing on the area.  Both are treated with anti-inflammatories.  If your pain persists I would recommend you follow up with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If you have been evaluated when you were symptomless it may not have presented.  A holter monitor can be helpful to determine the rhythm during episodes.

    "content": "I am 26, Female a social drinker and don't smoke.  For about 2 years now I have been having chest pains that are centered right over my sternum and I can feel them in my back between my shoulder blades.  I don't get them all the time and I am not sure what brings them on.  I haven't noticed any high stressful situations that bring them on because my overall job can be stressful.    When I do get them I get shortness of breath and I get really hot.  Pressing on my chest or back seems to help a little, but I think it is just a reflex.  I do notice that my heart rate increases and sometimes it flutters a little...kinda like it double beats or something.     A couple of episodes occurred while I was drinking alcohol (I only drink vodka and coke & not a lot I am not a drinker).  The symptoms were way worse and I had to go to the bathroom once to cry because it was so painful.  I could feel it in my left shoulder and my neck.  The other episode was the same, very painful and I felt the need to lay on my back.    The symptoms usually last for about 30-45 minutes.   I haven't gone to the doctor yet because in my job you pretty much have to go to the ER or come to work.   If I don't have a symptoms it is kinda hard to explain it to them... maybe I should print out this thread :)  ~family history~ mom has high blood pressure, grandma (paternal) diabetes, grandpa (maternal) triple bi-pass and pace maker.  I also have chronic migraines (which I am taking 100mg Topamax a day), and they thought I had TIAs, but changed thier minds.\n\n",

In the past two days I have noticed a tightening feeling in the middle of my chest. Today it spread to the right side of my chest. My first thought was to attribute this feeling to my anxiety problems, but I've never experienced this chest tightening before with previous anxiety attacks.  My blood pressure today was 119/84 (Pulse, 89), and it's always around that range. I'm not sure if that's important, but it wouldn't hurt to mention.  I take Zoloft for my anxiety disorder, Desyrel for insomnia, Xopenex and Fluticasone for asthma, and Singulair and Zyrtec for allergies.  Obviously I'm worried about heart problems, but I've been to the Emergency Room before with presumed heart problems which turned out to be symptoms of my Anxiety disorder.  So my question is, How can I tell the difference between an Anxiety Attack and a Heart Attack?\n\n",

Results: Not having heart attack at that time, but some damage and scarring from previous MI. I also have GERD.   Question: I have almost constant left side chest pain which occasionally is also present in left arm. It doesn't seem to be affected by diet, exercise, and is not helped by antacids either. No history of panic attacks or similar, but frustrated. Not convinced it is heart related (though I have some heart problems), but if acid reflux related, shouldn't it be helped by the prevacid and antacids? It never completely goes away, and severity varies.\n\n",

If you have a cardiologist it is probably time to stop in again and make sure all is good.  Reflux can sometimes be severe and not be initially responsive to medications.  You may also want to be tested for H. Pylori, a bacteria that can cause ulcers and gastritis.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "26 male H. Pylori Upper Endo/ Colon Prevacid, claritin D, albuterol  I havent been able to sleep for the past two nights. This just started last night after feeling a wierd fluttering in my chest. Went to the ER earlier today got an EKG and they released me with benign palpitations. It's still doing it frequently so I decided to record it tonight. (tonight)  Download Heartbeat2007-07-20.mp3  This is what I have been going through:  Main Concern: Throat \u2022\tSymptoms nonexistent before 9 months ago.  \u2022\tFeeling like lump in my throat 8 months ago, constantly clearing my throat to try and alleviate the feeling. Felt like it was just behind the tongue and was noticeable when swallowing.  \u2022\tNoticed Epiglottis continuously making a popping sound repetitively at random throughout the day, still does it to this day 8 months after.  \u2022\t4 months ago an agonizing itching sensation started in my lower throat. If I would turn my head to one side, tilt it all the way back or push with my finger just above my collar bone I could fully feel the itch more. I could also feel the itch more when breathing in and out through mouth.  \u2022\tThroat would appear to randomly get swollen to the point that it felt there was something blocking my airway when breathing and when swallowing it felt as if there was something stuck in my throat. Also noticed when taking vitamins.  \u2022\tA few times I have woken up in the middle of the night gasping for air then when waking I felt the swollenness.  \u2022\t2 months ago I started getting localized sharp pains in my lower front neck/throat.  \u2022\t It bothers me to talk and directly seems to be affecting the muscles in my throat used to when talking or moving the tongue.  Secondary Symptoms: \u2022\tSinuses Continuously Swollen, most problematic in upper nasal passages and around eyes including the forehead as well as large dark bags under eyes.  \u2022\tWhen sleeping or laying on a couch my hands/feet will start to go numb no matter what position I try to lay in. Often waking up in the middle of the night I will wake up and my hand, a finger or some toes will be completely numb until I shake it around.  \u2022\tLow energy and Headaches.  \u2022\tVision appears to be diminishing, predominantly in right eye.  also the DR checked my Epiglottis and Xray'd my throat to check my thyroid. Both appeared fine today.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Porschedrifter,  I'm not sure I can fully explain your symptoms.  It is a little hard to interpret your heart sounds without actually listening to you to correlate the sounds with your pulse but I suspect you may be having intermittent PVC's (premature ventricular contractions).  These can make the heart rate seem quite irregular.  Typically a few of them is considered normal.  Too many can be a problem.  You may want to have your actual thyroid hormone levels checked as some of your symptoms fit with a thyroid imbalance.    I would recommend you follow up with your doctor to discuss your symptoms further.  They are a little suspicious and warrant a full physical examination/evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "For about a week or so now, I have been having very random chest pains on my left side only right over my heart. They tend to be very very sharp to the point they stop me in my tracks and I have to sit down. They are very sharp and feel like someone is sitting on my chest. I am not having any shortness of breath, just very sharp pains in the left side of my chest. Ive just recently started taking birthcontrol (ortho tri-cyclen lo) for medical reasons because I recently found out I have PCOS (poly cystic ovarian syndrome) and I am wondering if my birth control could be the cause of my chest pains because I do smoke and I do smoke more than 15 per day. Any help/advice?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Willyoueraseit,  I'm sure one of the big questions that you've thought is \"is this related to my heart?\"  This is what most people with chest pain worry about.  Heart chest pain is usually not described as sharp and is generally more of a dull diffuse pressure that is a little difficult to pinpoint to one specific area.  Your pain that you are describing sounds to me more like pleurisy or costochondritis.  Pleurisy is inflammation of the lung lining.  It can cause very severe shortness of breath and chest pain.  Often it is made worse by deep breathing.  Costochondritis is inflammation of the cartilage of the rib.  This pain is often reproduced by pressing on the area where the pain is. Both these generally will resolve over time and often can be helped with anti-inflammatory medication.    I would recommend you see your doctor if this pain continues.  Also, just in case you weren't aware, smoking and birth control pills is often a bad combination.  The reason is that both smoking and birth control pills increase the risk of developing deep vein clots with subsequent risk of them breaking off and traveling to the lungs (called a pulmonary embolism).  These can be quite dangerous.  I'm sure you've been told but I would be remiss if I did not advise you to stop smoking.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your reply.. but I have not had any shortness of breath at all and when deep breathing I experience no problems whatsoever and when pressing on the area it does not cause me any discomfort. The pains come randomly when I'm doing basically anything from walking to doing nothing and just laying in my bed.. which is why I thought it may be due to my birth control because I am on my first pack of birth control at the moment and it started 2 weeks after I started taking them. I smoke anywhere from 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day and I am only 18 but I am sure at any age it is not a good mix. I told my doctor I did not want the birth control because of my smoking and I do not really like taking pills. I basically went ahead and took it because I was told it was help my pain for my PCOS but not until the 2nd pack even though Im taking Prescription strength Naproxen for pain during my menstrual period... and I also gave in to the birth control because I was told it may increase my chances of getting pregnant one day as I do not ovulate due to my PCOS. Should I consider going to check in my doctor about my birth control and see if maybe switching would be a good idea or just going off of it entirely?\n\n",

    "content": "Hmm... the chest pain may be related to the birth control pills since it started at the same time although it probably isn't due to pulmonary emboli.    I would recommend that you discuss this with your doctor.  You may be able to try a different pill that may not cause your chest pain.  There are literally hundreds of birth control pills.  Many have different hormones that  may not cause your symptoms.  The clotting risk with smoking is low given that you are young but it does increase your risk by taking contraceptives and smoking.  This would also be something to discuss with your doctor.  It may be that your doctor feels the benefits of the contraceptives outweigh the risks.  (Of course, the other solution is to stop smoking :) I promise  I won't say anymore about that.)  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I'm a 36-year-old male. For at least four months now, I have had the same symptom - whenever I twist my torso, I get an intense pain in my sternum (sometimes radiating down into my armpits or pecs). For example - if I'm in the car and want to look behind me, I can't without extreme chest pain. It's very specific to that sternum area. I get the same pain if I try top prop myself up in bed by resting on my elbow on one side or the other. Same pain if I bend from side to side. I thought I noticed a lump under the sternum area today, but I may have always had this. I'm generally really healthy and don't pay too much attention to my body. My doctor thought it might be GERD and put me on Protonix and then Aciphex. Also gave me Mobic. When none of those worked, I went on Celebrex. No relief from the chest pain on any of them. Other than this horrible specific problem, I'm in good shape. Not overweight, no cigarettes or alcohol or even coffee.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Whole9yards,  It sounds as if you may have a condition called costochondritis.  This is where the cartilage portion of the rib (where it connects to the sternum) becomes inflamed.  It can produce quite severe pain.  It is exhacerbated by moving the joint as it would with turning.  I would have expected that this would be a little better with the Mobic or celebrex since they help treat inflammation.  Another possibility is that you have a stress fracture of your sternum.  This would be fairly rare.  It may not be healing well since the area is moved frequently.  I would suggest that you see a sports medicine doctor.  They are the muscle/joint experts and will probably be able to help you figure out what is going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been experiencing chest/lung pain off and on for about the last year or so. Normally, it's in the center chest to just left of center. But other times it spread across the entire chest. usually the pain isn't too intense, but it has been bad a few times. it just comes and goes too. It may be there for 5 minutes, go away for and hour, then come back for 15 minutes, etc. Or, i may not have it for a week. Then it will occur frequently each day for a few weeks. I have seen my GP and he did an EKG and stress test (both normal) and there is no family history of heart disease. Sometimes I think I can feel my heart beating faster and/or harder. Most of the time I notice the pain outside of work, in the eves and on weekends. I take several fights of stairs daily, do some light weight lifting, bike a bit and go for walks and have never had the pain get worse or prevent me from doing anything physical. When it comes on, I am at rest almost without exception. I do have asthma and am on Advair (started about 3 months ago). I really don't think this pain is heart-related, but is it possible to have some sort of cardio issue when the discomfort only seems to come when I am\"at rest\" but never during exertion? Thank you\n\n",

Your heart is not getting enough blood and oxygen so it may require an emergency dept. visit.    There are lots of other causes for chest pain such as digestive problem (reflux), inflammation, gallbladder, asthma, pneumonia, pleurisy, muscle strain, anxiety, etc.   So, this may require extensive diagnosis by process of elimination of other causes.

    "content": "Hello, I'm an 18-year-old male (never smoked, never drinks or does drugs, occasionally does cardio exercises, typically calm and passive) that is very concerned about his health at the moment.  Other diagnoses: fatty liver, high liver enzymes, obese (275 lbs on 6'1\" frame, about 36-ish BMI). Previously diagnosed as mildly asthmatic in gradeschool, lots of bronchitis when I was a baby. No surgeries. Mother has had a heart attack at 48 and renal failure, rampant family history of diabetes but I have been checked numerous times and I don't have it. Meds: have been on Meridia appetite control meds and zyrtec but haven't taken them for a week or so.  For probably 6-9 months now I had been experiencing what I would describe as mild bothersome pressures or slight pain in the left chest area, usually in different places but always on the left side of my vertical divide. I went to my doctor. BP was normal. Did full blood work and everything. My cholesterol and thyroid are normal. Nothing out of the ordinary except liver enzymes which sparked more blood tests and I'm negative for hepatitis, hemochromatosis (some family has it), etc.  Had both a liver and heart ultrasound. That's how I discovered the fatty liver and my heart test came back normal. I've had several EKGs, all normal. I have a small hole in my heart from birth but have been told it's not an issue.  I've been on a high-fiber, no caff, low junk food and lower fat diet for two months now. I lost 25 lbs. so far (started around 300) and have started exercising more. That's where the story begins.  On Friday July 6 I pushed myself too hard on my exercise bike. When I got off my pulse would not return to normal. I got chills, dizziness, weakness, nausea, and moderate dull pain/heaviness over my left chest area. I do not have a history of panic attacks but I was in a bit of a panic at the time naturally. Went to the ER.  My BP was high, I was a bit dehydrated, oxygen level hovered between 97-100%, and my pulse never left the 115-140 range until I slept. EKG was normal, just a bit fast. Chest xray normal. Was admitted overnight and the \"heart attack enzymes\" they were talking about never showed up in any test. The cardiologist released me even though I had constant (90% of the time) upper-left chest heaviness and often had some trouble breathing. My sit-stand BP was fairly constant. (A little high like 150/80 though.) They scheduled a stress test Thurs Jul 13.  That night I had more severe bouts of chest heaviness. It got hard to breathe and I couldn't stand or hardly talk for a while. We called the cardiologist I saw in the hospital and he still thinks none of this is heart related. He said it might be digestional or musculoskeletal. He prescribed me a xanax generic and told me to take advil and pepcid. This combination helped some (I burped a lot which seemed to stop the severe bouts of heaviness).  The next day I woke up with some heaviness again. Went upstairs, took a shower, made breakfast. Took my pepcid, a low dose bayer, my xanax (the heaviness got me a bit worried). Sat down on the couch to eat my multigrain flakes and soy milk. Started getting dizzy, nauseous, and hard to breathe. I felt a strange tingle in my left arm. I tried to stand and nearly fainted but I could still walk. I got chills. We went to the ER and were seen after 2 hours. My pulse was normal 70-100 ish, but BP a little high 140/80 or so. Got a chest scan with iodine, came back normal. I was out within 3 hrs.  My cardiologist and doctor both predict my stress test will be negative and that I have no cardio trouble. My regular doctor even said that the stress test is a waste of $. He thinks it's digestion.  I still have constant (nearly 100% of the time) pressure with frequent mild left-chest pain, usually dull squeeze pain. Sometimes I feel it in my left arm or left armpit (rarely, maybe once in the back) and I'm constantly slightly light headed. This has been going on since my overexertion 80 hrs ago and not a minute before.  I am so confused. My family is worried sick, and so am I. Sometimes it feels like I'm about to have a heart attack at any time and I'm only 18. I go back to school in a one-horse town in August and am afraid for my life if I'm by myself and this keeps up.  Thanks mathmajor\n\n",

Of course that doesn't relieve your anxiety bout it very much.    I would suggest you get an appointment with a mental health professional. Perhaps you could benefit from some relaxation therapy, meditation or other therapy that would allow your mind to work on the problem.  As you mentioned your high anxiety, I assume this may actually be a factor so learning to manage such an attack is important. You may be able to stop it at an early sign, thus avoiding the more serious attack.    Learning these skills could be very helpful in other aspects of your life as well.  I am not saying it is emotionally based, but control could begin on this level anyway.  Continuing with a regular physician (family practice, internal medicine, etc.) to find the cause is also important, so continue with this follow up care..    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear yicker, I appreciate that you have taken your symptoms seriously enough to have a thorough evaluation by a cardiologist.  If all the tests came back negative for any cardiac problems, then it may be of value to explore non heart related scenarios.  It is very difficult to address issues that can contribute to either panic ( as your one doctor suggested) or to other somatic displays of stress or fear over the internet.  Everyone's tolerance to stress is different, and can even vary for that individual from moment to moment or day to day.  At whatever time the chest pains first began, or whatever precipitating factors may have triggered them, the ongoing experience of unresolved chest pain certainly becomes to some degree self-perpetuating.  Whenever a clenched jaw and a realization that one's coping mechanism is less than successful, then it may be a good idea to explore your concerns with a mental health professional.  This does not mean you are crazy, nor does it mean you are mentally \"ill\".  It only means that, as everyone does at some time or another, you may need some additional help in sorting out your current stressors, and in so doing may be able to find a way to identify the chest pain, and put it to rest. You have been so detailed in describing your current concerns, it is clear you have taken the time to really try to recognize  your reactions to situations (such as to people screaming around you).  That is the first step to finding the best way to address the issues.  Your town may have resources that are free or on a sliding scale to help you. Please consider exploring them.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 27 year old female, overweight.  My mother died at 45 from \"hardening of the arteries\", same with her father.  I started having chest pressure and pain around 2001, had many heart tests, came back normal, was diagnosed then with panic/anxiety disorder and was put on anti-depressants.  So, I've stopped taking my anti-depressants for about 7 months.  I've developed chest pressure and achey pain in the center of my chest that seems to radiate outwards in the chest.  In march 2007 I went and had a echo and a stress test, both came back normal.  These chest sensations have gotten the better of me now, and today I'm going for an electrolite stress test? I'm really worried, because everything on the internet tells me that my symptoms are heart related.  I have had a chest xray last week, and blood tests last week, all came back normal.  Could they have missed something in March, and really I have angina or some heart disease?  I do understand that I have anxiety and would benefit from going back on medication...but I'm so concerned about my heart right now!\n\n",

I started having chest pain on the left side for nearly a year now. It comes and goes. Lately, i feel my heart beats very hard and i feel very tense around heart area. When i exercise, i feel very tense around the heart area(like its beating just too hard). I have reflux, and i used to take a tablet called prevacid. I no longer take it though. I just wander whether reflux has anything to do with it and what else can this kind of symptom be? thx\n\n",

    "content": "Dear konijiba, Chest pain, even in a young and apparently very active man, can be caused by several different sources.  The chest houses not only the heart, but as you are aware, also part of your gastric system: specifically esophagus and upper part of the stomach.  Reflux can indeed cause chest pain.  So  can lung problems, and of course your heart.  What relieves your pain? Have you taken any over the counter antacids?  (You mention you used to be on Prevacid - did your MD discontinue this medication, or did you?)  Is exercise the only thing that aggravates the pain?  If you are unable to get relief from over the counter medications, and the pain persists, gets worse, or changes character please present to the local emergency room or urgent care center for professional Medical evaluation .\n\n",

    "content": "Age - 18 Sex - Female Past diagnoses - no known health problems; normal healthy pegnancy 8 months ago (with slight high blood pressure). Past surgeries - none Family history - parents-no health issues, grandfather & grandmother - cancer, great grandmother - heart attack. Current medications - none  A week ago, I developed mild neck pain, which felt like overuse from sitting incorrectly in front of the computer too long. Neck pain stayed for about a week. Mild upper back pain that started a day after the neck pain, but only lasted a few days. I have been skipping lunch (unintentionally...I keep forgetting until nearly dinnertime) for the past few weeks. (I don't know if the aforementioned symptoms are related to the rest.) Yesterday I had an episode of shortness of breath that lasted for a few seconds, with no chest pain or other symptoms. However, right after that, I had what I can only describe as a panic attack in which I was hyperventilating, had tingling sensations in both hands/arms and around my mouth and nose, and extreme anxiety. Today I had mild pain in the stomach area, and a sensation like right before vomiting, stomach tightening slightly, and it radiated into the left side of my chest. After that I felt nauseous for about a minute, then it passed and I felt just slightly dizzy and was better in a few minutes. A few hours later, I had a strange feeling in my chest, like the need to burp, but I couldn't burp. This lasted about a minute or so, went away, then came back after a few minutes, then I ate, and I felt better afterwords. Does any of this sound like a cardiac condition? I researched heart attack symptoms on the internet but they all describe a different type of chest sensation than what I was having. I (until about a week ago) ate fast food almost exclusively and don't exercise much besides chasing after a baby, which is why I'm worried about cardiac problems. I have had slightly prehypertensive blood pressure in the past, but for the past few months my BP has been normal. I have no idea about my cholesterol level because I have never had it checked.\n\n",

PVCs will become more frequent when the vagus nerve gets the upper hand from the sympathetic nervous system, whose job is to speed up the heart (among other things). When I read your first post I was wondering if perhaps your blood pressure was a little high. The addendum you tacked on answered that question, and that is probably why you are so aware of the forceful heartbeat. The slower the heart beats, the more time it has to fill. When the pressure is high like that and the rate is slow, a lot of people are much more aware of it than they would be otherwise. It all sounds pretty normal, although it is important to manage the high blood pressure.   Aldomet shouldn't slow your heart rate any further as it is not a beta blocking drug. At any rate, if your EKG is normal (with the exception of the slow rate) then so long as you can function well physically (stand up, walk around, etc., without getting lightheaded) then there's really no problem. However, once you've started the Aldomet, if it is effective, you may have some lightheadedness  upon standing, if only for a little while, so you should be prepared for that and get up slowly at first, so your body can adjust to the drop in blood pressure (which is what we want to take place!). You also may feel tired or drowsy for a period of days after first starting the Aldomet, so don't let that concern you too much.  It sounds as though everything is pretty much in order here. Your ordeal of not having slept for 30 hours would make your body want everything to slow down in order for you to rest and sleep. That would include your heart rate. The pain meds given in the hospital should have cleared your system by now, and while they can sometimes slow the heart rate a little (simply by allowing you to relax) they are not likely the culprit here. I think it is most likely just exhaustion. I hope you get some good sleep and that your BP normalizes quickly.   Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi - I would think that once you are thoroughly rested the rate should start to normalize again. It's hard to say exactly when that might be. The Aldomet may indirectly help keep it a little slower simply because it has a mild, transient sedative effect at first. Also, as a new parent you may not get thoroughly rested for a long time! The important thing is that you are able to function with the slow heart rate and even more important is to control that elevated blood pressure. It wouldn't hurt to get a follow up EKG done at your doctor's after a while, if the slow rate persists, although it is very unlikely to cause problems. If you should experience unusual lightheadedness on standing you should mention this to your doctor. Otherwise I think it's just going to take a little while for things to \"reset\" themselves, but that is fairly normal, given all the circumstances.   Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "Left Shoulder Pain",
    "content": "Hello, I'm a 33 y/o female that has been having pain in my left shoulder blade(for about 3 months).  This pain sometimes it radiates down my arm.  I have not done anything to my shoulder that would cause it hurt like this.  Do not smoke, have a healthy weight, and great BP and low cholesterol.  No past family history of heart problems.    Recently, the pain was so strong but only lasted about 5 min.  The next day I could feel the pain off and on. I sometimes feel some pain in my lower rib cage.   In March I had a dilated left pupil for four days.  BP was fine, CT and MRI of the head all clean.  I had a chest x-ray and CT of lungs as well.  I was recovering from a flu like illness when the eye dilated.  My lungs were shown as infected and I was treated with anitbiotics. Since March I have been dealing with anxiety attacks which I think stems from the illness.  I have also had bouts of dizziness and nausea and shortness of breath. When I do have the shoulder pain I generally don't have any other symptoms.  I have had to take Lovenox during two pregnancies because of a past stillbirth at 38w, with no know cause.  In the placenta there was more clotting than there should have been.  Bloodwork in one of my pregnancies after the stillbirth showed borderline anitphospolipid syndrome, but not in my last pregnancy.  Six years ago I had an echo, ekg that were all normal.  I was having dizziness and tingling in my hands and feet. My recent bloodwork has all come back normal, as well as a cardiac risk screening-which I'm not sure what that measures. I'm taking Xanax as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - There are a few seemingly minor details left out of your otherwise very thorough report which might be helpful at least in ruling out certain conditions which might be  causing your symptoms.  One, in particular, would be helpful to know: does any sort of bodily movement or posturing elicit or aggravate the pain in your shoulder?   The fact that there are no other symptoms directly associated with the shoulder pain, plus the fact that it is intermittent and has been going on for months now suggest it is unlikely to be cardiac-related. However, there are other possible intra-thoracic causes, most benign, but it  would be nice to at least be rid of the discomfort.   The dilated pupil episode also makes me wonder if there hasn't been some sort of injury to or irritation of the sympathetic nervous system or one of its branches, which could somehow be tied in with the shoulder blade pain. This is  all speculation, of course, and  the  big question still  remains: does any sort of movement cause or worsen the pain? If you could supply that answer it would be a huge help.  Meanwhile  you would  appear to be in general good health and doing the  right things. One of your big tasks will be managing the anxiety, at least until you are able to find an explanation for your other symptoms.  Cardiac risk screening consists of a blood lipids panel (HDL, LDL and VLDL components, with a ratio of HDL to total cholesterol), along with high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and homocysteine level. It's a very handy way to determine the individual's risk for the development of heart disease, excluding an unusual family history (which always must be factored in).   I'm sorry I can't be of more help at this point,but once the issue of pain upon body movement  is resolved we may be able to narrow the field a little.   I look forward to hearing more from you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again - You are very welcome. The dilated pupil may well be tied to the lungs in some way, as there is a cranial nerve which travels down into the chest and can be affected by things that have taken place down there, which then show up involving one eye. Usually this is either a drooping eyelid or constricted pupil, not a dilated one, but it still seems plausible, and if that is the case it is likely a very benign thing. (There are at least 47 conditions which can account for pupil dilation, but most of them can be easily ruled out here).  The shoulder blade pain could also be related to something going on inside your thoracic cavity, and since it is not aggravated by movement then it is more likely something internal, although it could be referred from  somewhere other than its apparent location, and it is very difficult to do more than speculate at a distance. A chest x-ray (PA and lateral views) might be useful. An inflammatory process could certainly be at the bottom of this, but it's really hard to tell. The anxiety (which is now probably more situational than anything else) only serves to cloud the picture by adding symptoms. That's one of those unavoidable things that make a good internist invaluable in situations like this.  Wish I could give you something more concrete, but due to the liimitations of this medium that's about the best I can do. Good luck to you with this and do let us know if anything changes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - The good news is you seem to be in  good shape cardiac-wise.  Still, who needs this kind of discomfort? It is likely referred from the upper part of the pleural membrane or diaphragm, quite possibly due to some passing viral infection. It also could  be due to an inflammation of a nerve or blood vessel which travels the  same path as the pain,  which could explain why your now beginning to have headaches with it as well. In most of the above-mentioned  scenarios an NSAID (such as Advil or Aleve) should help a great deal.   If  this continues I'd definitely bring it to the attention of my primary physician.  It's  probably not serious, but there is always that remote potential,  and mainly it is painful and that's just not something you need!  Good luck to you. Hope this  has been of some help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - If  it weren't for the symptoms coming  before the BP reading this wouldn't have been a concern. It is the symptomology that  makes the reading a slight concern. It is a pretty low reading, although some people do OK  with similar numbers. They are usually petite, however.   If there is any possibility that you've become  dehaydrated then your total fluids and thus blood volume could be depleted. Of course there are other ways blood volume can  become lowered, but they are usually accompanied by some pain or actual trauma. The low BP could also result from some sort of autonomic nervous system incompetence, but you would likely have had this happen before. Then again, everything does have to have a beginning point. If you wind up having to be worked up for this and some neurological basis for a hemodynamic problem is suspected, you could wind up having a tilt-table test. That's not terrible, but hopefully since  this came on abruptly it is caused by a transient, easily correctable problem such as dehydration or fluid volume depletion.   If the  problem still persists as of this exchange, I would definitely bring it to the attention of a physician, simply because it is not normal for you, and it is causing unacceptable symptoms.

    "content": "Hello - What you describe could possibly be some  sort of palpitation (caused by a rapid or irregular heartbeat) but your description makes it sound a little more like fasiculation instead, wherein a small area of voluntary muscle twitches rapidly off and on. If it occurs in close proximity to the area where the costochondritis was located then that's a  possibility. Then again, dexamethasone is a very potent steroid which, in the short term, can cause either palpitations or fasiculations. The drug should have long  since cleared your system by now, but sometimes  those  things are started by something like  that and  then continue on for a while.  One question: does the fluttering sensation last for long durations or merely moments at time? Whatever it  is, if it is sustained for a long time and/or causes other  symptoms  (such as lightheadedness or strong feelings of anxiety) then it would be worth another EKG or perhaps even a Holter monitor or other type of event monitor to determine if it  is  some  sort of heartbeat irregularity. These are usually harmless in young, otherwise healthy people, but if they cause symptoms or otherwise compromise your ability to function then they are worth at least a look.   I strongly suspect, simply by the way you've worded your post, that it is fasicular twitching you're feeling, but it is only speculation. I hope this will at least serve  to ease any concerns you may have. If this problem  continues to trouble you, I  wouldn't hesitate to at least bring it to the attention of your primary physician.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Magenta - While your described symptoms  do not sound cardiac-related, it's of course impossible to know for certain  at a distance, and besides, whatever it is, it has to at least be very annoying. It definitely deserves a doctor's attention.    Having IBS you could be  experiencing referred pain from  the splenic flexure of  your colon (upper left quadrant  of your abdomen), which happens a lot and can show up almost anywhere between the  left abdomen and the left shoulder, with the submammary (beneath the breast) pain being a common place for it to show up. It's good to keep in mind, too, that heart pain is almost always not sharp, stabbing or sudden in nature. The one possible exception to this rule would be  the pain that sometimes  accompanies mitral valve prolapse (MVP), an almost always benign condition that can be accompanied by a lot of odd symptoms and is almost never a cause for concern it itself.   One other non-cardiac possible cause might be costochondritis,  and inflammation of the  carilige in the space between any two or more ribs. Since the pain began with a change in position that is a possibility too. Increased pain on exhalation might also suggest costochondritis, or even a muscle spasm in the chest wall.   Palpitations  are awfully common, and even moreso in people who tend to be anxious or over-stressed.  They are also rarely of any concern, except insofar as they can provoke  a good deal of anxiety.   As you can see, even without any serious heart problem, there are plenty of potential causes of this sort of discomfort, and it  really should be  addressed by a doctor. I hope this serves to ease your mind, and  at the same time encourages you  to have the  thing  looked  into, so that it can be treated and made to go away. It can't be very pleasant, even if it doesn't sound serious.  Good  luck to you. Please keep in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "One possibility is that you are having anxiety attacks.  These frequently will give fast heart rates and feelings as if one is going to die.  Also, anxiety tends to be associated with depression.  If the attacks only happen while walking you may need to have a stress cardiac test to see what your rhythm is during the episodes.  A holter monitor or event recorder may also help to capture the heart rhythm during an attack.  Looking at the rhythm while the symptoms are there are the most helpful.  I would recommend talking to your doctor about some of these tests to see if they would be appropriate for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

For the last 4 years I have experience on and off chest discomfort.I went to my family physician and he gave me an EKg and said everything looked fine, but diagnosed me with panic and anxiety disorder. Over the  next year I experienced the discomfort every once in awhile I went back to my doctor about a year later, and he did another EKg sating eerything looked okay and took blood, he also had me do a 24 hour halter. I never heard back about the results of the haalter so I assumed all was fine. Another year went by and I went to a new physician who took blood and said everything was fine, he also told me I had panic and anxiety disorder. The pain changes, sometimes it is a sharp pain, sometimes it is a dull pain, and it is never in the same place in my chest. I never experience shortness of breath or arm pain. I am constantly concerned it is my heart, what do you think?\n\n",

    "content": "Given all your normal testing it is unlikely to be the heart.  Also, heart pain very rarely presents as sharp pain.  It typically is described as more of a dull severe pressure that is difficult to pinpoint to one specific area of the chest.  It may be that you have a bit of costochondritis.  This is inflammation of the rib cartilage.  This pain can be reproduced by pushing on the inflamed area.  You may also have some areas of pleurisy, inflammation of the lining of the lungs/chest wall.  This pain can be quite sharp and severe.  It is often worse with deep breathing.  You may also want to try an antacid liquid during the pain episodes to see if they are potentially related to reflux.  Without some fast heart rate and shortness of breath it seems less likely to be related to anxiety; however, this by no means rules it out.  It does not seem likely to be anything life-threatening at this point given all your normal tests.  If the episodes persist I would recommend that you follow up with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am a female almost 37 years old.  I was very ill and diagnosed with Fibromylagia several years ago.  I was hospitalized for 5 days and very dehydrated.  I had about 70 different symptoms, from hair loss to feeling like I was on a boat all the time, to weight loss and increased sense of smell and to sound.  The list of symptoms went on and on..  I have lifted weights and excersised since I was 16, 3 to 4 times a week.  I don't smoke or drink.  I am 5'8\" and about 129.  For months I got sicker and sicker and went from jogging at 6am to crawling on my hands and knees up the stair case to bed because my legs ached so bad and I was weak.  I feel 98% better than I did 3 years ago but have had trouble breathing ever since I became ill with FM.  While hospitalized I had a nuclear test on my lungs, and have had many ecocardiagrams which are fine.  My Doctor in the hospital was an internal medicine Doctor and a Pulmonary Doctor.  I was given a test wher I had to breathe into a machine and push a ball up in the air.  The person giving the test accused me of not even trying.  I was blowing as hard as I could.  Then he gave me a whiff of a bronchidiolater?  And my test significantly improved as I was able to blow much harder.  The Doctor told me I didn't have asthma but gave me a prescription for an inhaler.  I didn't understand that.  My brother had severe asthma growing up and spent many night getting shots in the emergency room.    My question is... I wonder if I could have asthma?  I feel a pressure on my chest sometimes in the middle but mostly under my left breast.  I sometimes wake up coughing in the middle of the night.  When I breathe I can hear wheezing in my nose but not in my chest.  I'll breathe great for a month to 6 weeks and then I will have difficulty breathing for 2 weeks at a time.  The Doctor also did a cat scan and checked my sinus cavity..I think that is what it is called.  Also, my legs feel extremely heavy when I climb stairs.  Like they have weight tied around them.  I know that many of the symptoms are the same for FM.  Also, sometimes at night I get pain in my calves.  And at the base of throat it feels full and like the air isn't getting thru.  Thank you in advance for your response...blessings,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there - OK, let's see. You were having trouble breathing and responded well to what we'll assume was a puff or two of albuterol. You have a family history of asthma and the doctor prescribed a bronchodilating inhaler for you, which seems to be working. I hate to be sarcastic about your doctor, who may have been splitting some semantic hairs, but it would seem you do have asthma, at least according to everything you've written here.   Of course there are other problems which can cause bronchoconstriction, but essentially that's asthma, even if it is secondary to some other problem. It really sounds like that's one part of your collection of things, and the rest certainly fit in well with the diagnosis of FM.   Asthma can sometimes be caused by not only postnasal sinus drainage but also nocturnal esophageal reflux, which often causes the patient to wake up at night with a hacking or tickling cough, shortness of breath, or high-airway wheezing. Again, it is still asthma. It may be splitting hairs, but that's what it sounds like has been happening.   Best of luck to you and please keep us updated.\n\n",

I do believe it is asthma because it comes and goes, and I have terrible allergies also and live in the mountains with a lot  of oak trees, etc..  The Doctor perscribed the inhaler but told me I didn't have asthma so I actually never used it.  But yes, it did improve significantly in the hospital.  And I do get that tickly feeling in my throat at night and it wakes me up.  It is a strange pressure.  Thank you & Blessings,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there - You're very welcome. Yep, it's oak tree pollen time for sure. Also, the tightness you described is a common complaint with asthma as people wind up using accessory muscles they don't usually have to use much, which then get tight and sore feeling.   I\"d suggest using the inhaler whenever you feel like you're working too hard to breathe. It can really make a difference, even if you \"don't have asthma.\" I'll just scratch my head over that one.   Be well and do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  I'm 24 years old and was released from the hospital earlier this week.  I went to the ER because I had intense sharpness, tightening, pain in the center of my chest.  On the way to the ER it began to ache on the left side of my chest.  My heart rate was near 200 when they hooked me up to the moniters.  They gave me adivan and after a few hours my heart rate was near 160.  I also had some other symptoms.  For the last few months my ankles have been swelling periodically and I have been feeling tingling in my toes - especially left side and big toe.  They seemed to think this was not related at all and I never heard anything more about my chest pain. I quit smoking, drinking caffeine while I was in the hospital and they released me by telling me that I have tachycardia that has a mind of its own.   Now, later in the week.  I don't feel my heartbeat giving me trouble, but the chest pain continues.  It is happening more frequently at night.  I feel short of breath and when I push in on the center of my chest (a little to the left, near the top of my sternum) the pain becomes worse.  The tingling in the toes is happening every night and I feel as if I am not getting circulation to my feet. I'm very scared and all I have been told is that I'm too young.  I question myself on whether I should get a second opinion soon or wait a month for my next check up.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 33 year old female who is significantly overweight. I have been having strange chest pains for the past week and a half. A brief history, 4 1/2 months ago I was admitted into the hospital with massive bilateral pulmonary embolisms (blood clots) due to multiple factors including birth control and sitting for long periods of time (college student studying). I was in the hospital for a week, I had an ecg and an echocardiogram done and was told my heart was in perfect condition. I am now currently on lisinopril because my blood pressure is a little high and warfarin blood thinner, I also take a daily multivitamin. I am extemely stressed, I graduated and am unemployed and can't find a job. I have no health insurance and am thousands and thousands in debt from the hospital stay in addition to all my school loans. About a week and a half ago I started having chest pain, a few times a day I get a quick zap or twinge of pain in the left side of my chest lasting no more than 5 seconds and then it's gone. Sometimes when I yawn, when I exhale I feel a soreness and have had some pain in my upper back by my left shoulder blade which I haven't had in a few days. I've been working on losing weight and was on the treadmill for 30 minutes the other day and was worried but I had no pain at all and everything was fine. Like I said, I just get these twinges of pain a few times a day for a few seconds and then the pain once in a while when I yawn. I was at the doctor last week to get my blood checked because I'm on warfarin and that and my blood pressure were fine. I have no shortness of breath, sharp chest pain, or any other symptoms. I don't think it's blood clot related because I'm on the blood thinners and don't have any of the same symptoms as previously. Could this be stress related? Has anyone experience anything similar to this? I read somewhere that if pain comes and goes it's probably not cardiac but who knows. I'm trying to prevent a bunch of expensive tests considering I have no insurance and was in the hospital recently. Thanks.\n\n",

Skipping feeling heart beat, dizzy and high blood pressure 160 over something.  A volinteer Aumbulance service was there and they sent me ASAP to the Hospital in a City Ambulance.  All the doctor said to me at that time was i was in the sun to long even after I had told him I was outside no more than 10 minutes.    Well I still get these sensations even after almost every test ECG Holter, Another one like a holter last much longer.  Beta Blockers. Stress test.  Have not had a Atrerial blockage test what ever that  one is.  I have now been able to tell when these episoads are coming. I seem to get a thick mucus in my nasal and neck.  Still get the hard beating in my left side neck. Dull discomfort top left chest Dizzy and sometimes sick feeling.  Extreme tired feeling after it feel like the heart stops for a couple of seconds and restarts.  this can happen out of the blue and my wife now notices when it occures as it stops me in my tracks with no warning.  I would like to go back to my Doctor but they have found nothing even the Specialist they say somethings like Super Vent Tacy Cardia maybe PVC.

    "content": "Dear Wetodd, I strongly suggest you ask your cardiologist to allow you to undergo a complete heart evaluation, to include Echodoppler, Carotid doppler, Bilateral subclavian ultrasounds, possibly even Cerebral angiogram.  Have they been able to check your blood pressure on BOTH arms during one of your episodes?  There is a syndrome called Subclavian Steal Syndrome in which stenosis in the proximal subclavian artery can cause abnormal blood flow to the brain and sometimes to the heart.  The quickest check for this is to do blood pressures in both arms.  The natural laws of physics includes facts like fluids flow toward the path of least resistance, and if the pressure of the blood toward the brain is unequal L to R, the blood actually drains away from the brain instead of feeding to it.  This can cause dizziness, and you could possibly feel the pulse stronger on the non obstructive side.  Many things can contribute to cardiac arrhythmias, and it sounds like you need a full hospital stay with complete workup to determine if there is any abnormal pathology or electrical activity regarding your heart.  Supraventricular tachycardia can cause some of the sensations you describe as well, and a Nuclear stress test may be of value in the diagnostic workup.  Has your cardiologist done or offered any of the above tests? Do you have any of the results of the lab work I am sure they did for you?  Is there any particular time of the day these episodes occur?  With a strong family history of severe cardiac problems, you should continue to try to find out what is wrong.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello shaz29 - This sensation is often mentioned by frustrated patients who are unable to assign a cause to it. The fact is sometimes there is no truly solid cause that can be found. Some possibilities (all benign) are: nerve irritation, chest wall inflammation, costrochondritis (inflammation of the cartilege where the ribs connect to the sternum), and even mitral valve prolapse (MVP), an almost always benign and sometimes controversial finding which is associated with a very long list of odd symptoms that would otherwise be impossible to explain. Your complaint is one of them.   If you can reproduce any local soreness or tenderness by pressing on the immediately affected area, it is probably costrochondritis. Otherwise the most likely cause is an irritated nerve.   Best of luck to you and keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Shazad - We've actually got miles and miles of nerve servicing most every part of our bodies, even the skin and the very thin fatty layer over the sternum. as well as the bone itself (although it's probably not actually coming from the bone). There's also the common and annoying phenomenon of referred pain (or sensation) from some indirect location. It sounds as though you may have an a mild neuritis (inflammation of one or more nerves) somewhere in the general vicinity of your sternum. This generally presents itself as a pinprick sensation, pins-and-needles, numbness, tingling, or burning over the affected area. Sometimes the cause can be viral, sometimes orthopedic.   If the sensation continues and is bothersome (which I would expect it would be) then I would suggest bringing to the attention of an internist or general practitioner, since cardiac causes seem to be pretty much out of the question.   Best of luck to you and please do keep us updated.\n\n",

Lately doctors are tending to favor more the neuroleptic drugs over the tricyclics (of which amytriptyline is one) because of less side effects, but yes, if your doctor were to suggest this it might well relieve or at least reduce the discomfort.\n\n",

I misspoke (or my brain did anyway) when I typed \"neuroleptic.\" I actually was thinking of anti-seizure drugs instead, and some of those now being used to block nerve pain are gabapentin (as Neurontin), pregabalin (as Lyrica), and a number of others. They are generally less likely to cause the lethargy, sleepiness, etc., that most tricyclics can cause, and are in general safer and more effective.   Hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Amytriptilyine is a very utilitarian drug. It has many possible uses, and pain management is a big one. While not everyone responds the same way to every drug (which is why there are so many) it certainly is true that many people get relief from headache with amytriptilyne, as well as relief from the pain of shingles, various kinds of neuritis and neuralgia, etc. It is a very good idea to take it at bedtime, since that way the body has time to adjust to the drowsiness-inducing quality of the drug, something that should wear off with time.   Good luck to you with this. Give it a few days to reach full effectiveness, and do let us know how things work out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  I'm 31/f, non-smoker and not overweight.  4 weeks ago I started having heart palpitations that would start for no reason.  Went to the ER twice in a week.  1st time my doc sent me because my heart was beating 160bpm.  Was told to stop taking celebrex and flexeril that I had just started taking 1 week prior.  Then 6 days went by and I was still having the racing and shortness of breath (all I would have to do is get up and start walking) and then I started getting chest pains.   Went back to ER and they gave me toprol and follow up with cardiologist.  I have a very loud murmer, but echo shows no prolapse.  Stress test was normal (while still on the toprol).  She couldn't give me answers for the rapid heartbeat, said the chest pains are probably not heart related and to see a gastroenterologist.   The toprol is working good as far as the tachycardia is concerned, but I'm still getting sharp chest pains and a lot of pressure.  I know I don't have a GI problem.  I do not have high BP by the way and i'm not anxious.  I'd really like some answers, any ideas?  Thanks\n\n",

Chest pain may also be caused by the lungs as well.  If there is some inflammation of the linings of the lungs it can cause significant chest pain.  Following up with your doctor is important.

    "content": "Hello  I'll try my best to give all the details I can. I am a 27 year old woman with a few medical conditions such as Scoliosis and an inverted uterus (or so my mother calls the condition), the latter causes me agonizing pain each month with my cycle and for as long as I can remember I've been taking 600 mg motrins for the pain. I abused this as a child, trying hard to have a normal day, and would some times take several of those pills.  As an adult I've decreased to only one, but recently I've had a strange and severe reaction. When I take the motrin's I get no pain relief at all and then within the hour I find myself nauseated and puking up anything and everything - I assume the pill included. After this I feel better. Needless to say I've stopped taking them.  However in an attempt to find another pain relieved I switched to a 500 mg tylenol, but found myself running into another severe reaction. I took three within 3 hours of each other. The first two I took and they helped, all seemed normal except I felt a little light headed. Three hours later I took one more since I was still somewhat in pain and everything snowballed. My heart was pounding, I was told I was hyperventilating, my vertigo was so bad I couldn't focus on anything and could barely walk. I also experienced a numbness that went from my eyes to the back of my skull like a skunk stripe (I could still feel my ears though). I slept it off and felt better.  I'd like to know what these reactions are, and if there is another pain killer anyone can suggest.  Thank You,  Rochelle\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rochelle - The reaction to ibuprofin (as  Motrin) makes  some sense, since this drug can really irritate the stomach lining. Some  people are more sensitive to it than others, but since you say you \"abused\" it when you were younger there's a chance that either your stomach lining just doesn't want to see it anymore,  or even that you've developed a  rare allergic reaction to it. It's probably wise to avoid this drug in light of the history.  The apparent reaction to acetominophen is also rather unusual and may have had some other component involved that we  don't know about, but you did exceed the recommended dosage by about 50 per cent. That wouldn't normally cause the kind  of  reaction you describe,  but it's possible. More likely, though, it sounds as though you experienced a panic attack, which would be  unrelated to the Tylenol.   One reason this might  have happened  (or even both reactions) is that  since you probably have a tilted (inverted?) uterus, your periods  are far more uncomfortable  than normal,  and this  could have triggered some sort of reflex response.   I would  strongly suggest you bring this to the attention of a gynecologist, who may well prescribe a different medication for  the  painful periods. You obvioiusly are going to need something at least briefly during those times. There are alternatives prescription pain medications that hopefully wouldn't affect you the way the over-the-counter ones  have. Tramadol comes to mind as a likely effective and  innocuous prescription drug you could use on a limited basis if your doctor feels it is appropriate.  I hope this is of some help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rochelle - I'm glad you'll be getting this checked. There's probably something that will work a lot better for you. I certainly hope so!   Panic attacks can be triggered by a lot of things, but usually there is some underlying condition or situation that leaves the patient prone to this happening. In your case it could be as simple as the hormonal change that takes place routinely during mestruation. Combine that with the excruciating pain and maybe some stressor that normally might go overlooked, and all of a sudden there's all this strange stuff happening with no apparent explanation. It wouldn't necessarily be directly related to the Tylenol, but possibly indirectly (for instance, a reaction to the extra 500 mg. may have made you feel ill, which could make for a bad coincidence, since it was during your period and also at the height of your physical pain). Sometimes it just takes one straw to set off something like that. It's worth considering, anyway, I think.   Good luck to you and please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mike - One thing you said is interesting: \"My chest feels tight all the time.\" Is that literally the case, or do you mean  it feels that way frequently? The difference is that most cardiac-related issues which cause chest  tightness would not be constant for two years without something dramatic having happend a long time ago. On the other hand, anxiety can cause a  fairly constant, vague sense of tightness in the chest. So can  asthma,  which more and more often is uncovered recently because of complaints of chest tightness rather than  wheezing or shortness of breath.  Is it possible you might  have asthma? (There is a very simple test to rule this out). The doctor who pronounced the problem  anxiety-related is probably right, but at a distance and with no specific test findings it is difficult to say with any degree of certainty. Did  the doctor at least perform a 12-lead EKG? Anxiety also frequently can cause sharp,  stabbing, left-sided chest pains, especially in  the area of the left breast, though usually not so high up. This pain  you describe also could be  related to a respiratory problem such as asthma, since one may be using accessory muscles,  which makes them  sore and  painful.  It's just a thought.   If your doctor did even a cursory cardiac workup it would help to know that and would help support the anxiety theory. There  is also the possibility of chronic chest wall irritation, which is not dangerous or serious, but can  cause the same  sort of pains and discomforts that you describe. This is usually treated with antiinflammatory meds such as ibuprofin.   I hope this helps put your mind  at east. If you have any more information I'd be happy to hear it.  Good  luck  to you.\n\n",

The sharp pains in my left chest area are slightly higher than the nipple and a little towards the middle of the chest from the nipple.

    "content": "You're very welcome. Absent any hint of asthma and knowing that your doctor did do what sounds like a 12-lead EKG (the usual), then anxiety is certainly at least a possibility, and it would seem far less likely that the problem is cardiac-related. It may well be a chronic chest wall irritation or inflammation, such as Tietz' Syndrome, which is inflammation of the cartilege between one or more ribs where they join the sternum.  One way to check for this would be to exert moderate pressure on the affected area with one or two fingers. If you find the area is tender when  pressed upon, you almost certainly have Tietz' (or costochondritis). This responds well to OTC drugs like ibuprofin (as Advil or Motrin). If there's no local tenderness then anxiety becomes a more likely cause.  Even if the pain is frequent rather than constant, if it were cardiac-related, it would likely have produced more or worsening symptoms long before now.  Actually I'm just outside of DC, so we're practically neighbors!   Good luck to you. Let me know if you've checked for local tenderness.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I'm a 34 year old female, pack a day smoker. Two months ago I had a burning pain in the right side of my chest, above the breast, towards the armpit with a rapid heart rate and a hot feeling that goes to the back of my neck. Went to the ER, had stress test, chest X-ray, CT scan, echocardiogram, EKG, and bloodwork. All came back negative. Went to the family doctor, who said costochondritis and gave me ibuprofen. Went back to the ER two weeks later with similar symptoms. My pulse was 120. They tested blood for thyroid and came back negative. Went to the cardiologist who saw me in the ER. He said it could be a sign of perimenopause, told me to stop taking The Pill and put me on 25mg of Atenolol.   I will have a string of good days and then I'll have a day where I have pain on either side of my chest, never lasting longer than a couple of seconds, and a rapid heart rate. It's making me tired.  My appetite is gone. I only manage to eat one meal a day and I've lost over 20 pounds, from 148 to 127.  My family doctor sent me for more bloodwork and all they found was slighly high cholesterol. 221 total, 132 bad cholesterol.  I saw a second cardiologist today. The nurse did an EKG and pulse was 105. When the cardiologist checked my pulse, it was 80. He said it's not my heart and that it's either an autoimmune disease or it's anxiety/depression. I don't feel depressed or anxious about anything. Life is going good except for this health problem.  Please help. I don't want to go on anxiety medication, especially if it's unwarranted. Thank you.\n\n",

I have been off from work for the past 9 months because of this but i am returning to work tomorrow. Hope this advice helps\n\n",

    "content": "Hello senigod - I will reluctantly skip the sermon about smoking. You already know this will cause you problems that may eventually become life-threatening and will worsen any existing problems, no matter what they are. Nope, that wasn't the sermon. That was just the obligatory response to your having listed being a pack-day-smoker. Nothing good will come from that. Only you can eliminate that health risk.  That being said, the pain you describe doesn't really sound heart-related, for two reasons: one, it is very brief and fleeting, and two, its location is so far from the center (and can be on one side or the other at different times). This makes a cardiac cause fairly unlikely. The reason for the rapid heartrate following these episodes is most likely a startle reflex caused by the sudden onset of the pains. That just leaves us to figure out what's causing them.  Since these pains seem to be located in an area where the upper bronchial tree can refer pain, and also sounds somewhat pleuritic in nature, it may be that you're suffering from an irritation of the pleura, the protective membrane that surrounds the lungs. This pain is usually triggered by a deep breath, however.   The possibilities suggested by doctors all seem reasonable except for perimenopause, as 34 seems awfully early for that. The chostocondritis idea has possibilities but can easily be ruled in or out by pressing on the area in question. If you can provoke pain by moderate finger pressure in the general area of the pains then that's the likely cause. Also twisting of the upper body might have the same effect. Any pain that can be elicited by pressure or changing position is not cardiac related.   I can't help thinking that smoking may have something to do with this, though, if only secondarily.   There's still the anxiety angle, too. Although you deny stress and anxiety other than that generated by the symptoms, you also state your appetite is \"gone\" (and eating once a day I'd say that's an accurate assessment). Anxiety and/or panic attacks can actually kill one's appetite, cause non-specific chest pains, increase the heart rate and otherwise wreak havoc. In most such cases the patient denies a problem in precisely the area where it lies. It sounds strange but it's true.   Work on the smoking, as that will, as I've already said, make anything worse and ultimately cause you real, serious problems. Also open yourself up to the possibility of an anxiety-related problem. There are some really innocuous medications now available that can help a lot. And of course that's only one possibility.   I'm really doubting the perimenopause theory.   It seems you've ruled out any serious physical problems, so it might be worthwhile to take a closer look at anxiety as a cause. This is one of the sneakiest things we can encounter and the person so-affected is usually the last one to know.   Good luck to you and please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello asimkalim - While the symptoms you describe are highly atypical for cardiac pain, the pathway of radiation and the sweating argue for a medical rule-out of any sort of cardiac involvement. Chest pain which is clearly circumscribed is almost never heart-related, but you could have some sort of less serious structural problem. Costochondritis comes to mind first, but this rarely causes pain which radiates. The sweating and the hot extremities suggest a peripheral nervous response of some sort, but since the pain recurs and clearly causes you some concern, a visit to your primary physician seems a good way to allay your concerns and perhaps get the problem resolved at the same time.   Good luck to you and please keep us updated.\n\n",

I would definitely bring this to the attention of an MD.   The fact that this has gone on for a year now is encouraging in that a cardiac-related problem would have become worse and presented more serious symptoms. The bad news is that it's been going on for a year; you're probably pretty tired of dealing with it by now. By all means I would take this to a doctor for evaluation.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello MALICE - You have described one of the prominent features of both chronic generalized anxiety and panic disorder (GAD and PD). These pains are often physiologic in nature, not imagined, but are completely benign. The trouble is our awareness is trained on our heart's actions and our breathing when we suffer from anxiety (often a device to distract us from the real cause of our anxiety). Also, faulty breathing patterns that occur in anxious persons will eventually cause a variety of misleading symptoms including stabbing, sharp, rather random chest pains that further pull our attention toward that part of our body.   Since you have been diagnosed with panic disorder already, the challenge, for you, will be to learn to differentiate between symptoms which are attention-worthy and those which can be discarded at once. This isn't as easy as it might seem (as I'm sure you already know).   For our purposes here, the best thing I can tell you is that the pains, by nature and description are almost certainly benign, and they are also common in people with PD, often due to the above-mentioned faulty breathing patterns adopted by anxious people and also certain abnormal postures which sometimes become habitual for those same people.   I wonder how the Zoloft has worked for you so far as PD is concerned. Have you noticed a general improvement as yet? Sometimes the SSRI family of drugs work well, but are starting to fall out of favor since they can also provoke anxiety  in some people who are already prone to agitation. If you don't see significant improvement your doctor might consider changing over to something like clonazepam (Klonopin) which is a long-acting anti-anxiety and anti-seizure medication related to Xanax but long-acting and without many of the unwanted side-effects of Xanax.   Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Chest pain worries narcoleptic patient",
    "content": "First, let me say Hello and thank you for reading my post. I appreciate the time you have taken to read what I have to say.  I am a 23 year old male who has been diagnosed with narcolepsy, asthma and infectious arthritis (caused by a very bad strep infection). Otherwise I am pretty healthy.  My family has a history of heart and vascular diseases on both sides of the family as well as diabetes (father), cancers (both grandfathers, father, grandmother and cousin), lupus (aunt) and allergies (ranging from mild to severely life threatening). My grandmother had her first CVA when she was about 35 and continued to ischemic strokes until she died at age 45. My brother has high blood pressure which is quite often as high as 237/180, even on medication. Mother has hypertension and my father did, too.  I am currently taking 300mg Provigil po qd, 50mcg Flonase po qd and Allegra 180mg po qd. For pain management I use ibuprofen 800mg prn po OR 650mg aspirin/195mg salicylamide prn po, but generally try to avoid NSAIDs unless necessary.  My primary concern is that I have narcolepsy, and besides Provigil, I have been on stimulants of all kinds for many years. 3 years ago, I suffered a massive strep infection (asymptomatic to full onset in less than 10 hours) which required short term hospitalization. Altogether, I have had 27 strep infections over 7 year period. After treatment for the last infection, I have not had any infections, but I was left with permanent joint pain. I was told to be watchful of heart related problems from the infection.  The problem I have is I have been getting sudden chest pain (on my left side, only in the area of the heart) in the last 8 months, which goes away within seconds or moments. It is a very deep, sharp pain which definitely feels internal and occurs sometimes when I stand up, move around, am physically active or sometimes when at rest.  At times this is accompanied by a pulsating feeling in my neck, around the area of the common carotid. It generally feels like it is a force traveling upwards, lasting a few seconds, and then subsides. I can feel the throbbing if I touch my neck when this happens.  Sometimes my pain radiates to my shoulder or armpit or shoulder blade, but is brief. I have gotten light headed at times when this happened esp. when standing up.  I had 2 EKGs, both normal, but pain was not present in either. I just wanted to know if this is something I should check out or if it is benign.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Vo2x - While sudden, transient, sharp pains are almost never associated with heart disease, this sort of symptom is probably very difficult to ignore, and since it has more components than just the fleeting pain itself it must cause some anxiety for you.   It sounds as though there is some structure or perhaps nerve pathway which is highly sensitive. It could be subsequent to one of your many infections. At any rate, it is a bother at the least. Does ibuprofin seem to relieve the episodes? This would argue for some sort of small inflammation somewhere. Since it occurs upon standing it is probably neuromuscular. Since it is sometimes accompanied by a pulsation in the neck (do you ever feel this when the pain has not occurred?) it could be that you have the usual occasional premature heartbeat, but that this is triggering the pain indirectly (some people describe premature ventricular contractions as \"painful\").  It is also possible that since the pain is sudden and fleeting it is also startling, and that might cause an actual momentary increase in cardiac output, which would be detectable as a pulsation in the neck if one were quick enough to check for it.   While in all likelihood quite benign, if this continues to happen it will become one more thing to deal with. If it can be minimized medically it would be to your advantage, as you have quite enough to deal with as it is.   At the very least I would mention it to my doctor. There may be some simple explanation or, better yet, a simple solution.   Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello SirWence - To answer your main question, one's heart rate normally should be between 60 - 100. That, however, is an arbitrary range and what is normal for one person is not for another. Then with use of beta blockers the rate will often be considerably slower. As a rule doctors like to see it stay above 50, but in reality, if there is no problem with the heart's electrical conduction system it can get down into the 40's (although if it does one ought to check in with the doctor just to be sure nothing new has developed). As a rule people on an effective dose of metaprolol will, at rest, have a rate somewhere between 50 and 70. During exercise it can get considerably higher, and when very relaxed or falling asleep it can fall below 50. So you seem to be squarely in the \"normal\" range for someone using a beta blocker. Of course the Xanax can actually have a slight additive effect and possibly make things a tiny bit slower.   Anxiety (and the attendant release of adrenaline) can really get one's sinus heart rate higher than you might expect. This is the real underlying problem that needs to be managed - panic attacks and GAD, as I'm sure I don't need to tell you, can be incapacitating and really disrupt one's life. Good luck with that and as far as the heart rate and meds you are right on the money.   Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 27 year old Female. I went to the hospital in Nov of last year and found out I had a Ectopic pregnancy. My tube had ruptured so, they had to remove it. (right) Well, I decided to get Implanon inserted into my arm. It was inserted on the inside of my left arm... on Jan. 18 of this year.  About 5 days ago, I started having dull chest pains right underneath my left breast. They last about 5 seconds and come back every 5-8 seconds. It seems to last an hour or so at a time and might happen 3-5 times in a day. I do smoke about a pack a day. Along with this, I am also getting aches around the insertion site... my upper inner left arm. The only other thing that has happened with this...as of yet... has been a bad pain on the top of my left hand beneath my middle finger... towards the center. It lasted about 30 minutes and was very painful. That happened last night.  I called the DR. that inserted the implant and they seem to think its nothing, but he  mentioned that another girl about a month ago that had implanon came in complaining of the same symptoms.  I have had a Thyroid disease in the past with one of my pregnancies that went away. I am currently not on any medications, except the Implanon.  My father has Emphasyma, as does my mother. My mother also has Heart Failure ,Heart disease and Brittle Bone disease.    I am very worried. I have three children to think about.If someone could get back to me on this, I would be very grateful.                                  Gena\n\n",

    "content": "I read through the patient information about the Implanon birth control device.  It does list as a known side effect pain at the insertion site.  It is also possible that some local inflammation could be irritating a nearby nerve causing pain down the arm.  It does not list chest pain as a side effect.  However, each woman is different and you may be experiencing a side effect of the medication.  The medication information states that it is unknown whether or not Implanon increases blood clot risks.  I would suspect that it does as almost all other hormonal birth control pills increase the risk of clot formation.  Smoking increases that risk significantly.  With all the other risks that smoking increases I would advise you to stop smoking.  (I'll get off the soap box now.)  There are a few other possible causes of your chest pain.  First, heart chest pain is generally not that well localized.  If you are able to point with one finger where it hurts, it's probably not the heart.  I think that it is fairly unlikely that your chest pain is being cuased by blood clots unless they are very small.  Typically, blood clots in the lungs can cause chest pain but also cause some difficulty breathing.  If your pain is also caused by pressing in the same area with your finger you may have costochondritis.  This is inflammation of the bone/cartilage of the rib.  If your pain is aggravated by taking a deep breath you may have pleurisy.  Pleurisy is inflammation of the lining of the lungs/chest wall.  It can cause very severe pain or more mild pain.  I would recommend that you discuss your symptoms with your gynecologist about your symptoms.  She may refer you to your primary care doctor if it is suspected that the chest pain is unrelated to your birth control device.  Best wishes.  I hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I've been having problems wearing my cpap. It flares these problems up (though already had): nasal congestion, sinus type pain, blood in mucus, facial & nasal pain was so bad I had to quit wearing the machine. Then I had a cat scan that showed a mild deviated septum, swelling in middle of septum (doc didn't know why), and a large turbinate which blocks the nasal passages on the right side, turbinate curves the opposite way it's supposed to (believe it was the middle one but it was either the upper or middle one. Sinuses clear. Been through alot of meds, nothing much helps. Recently started propping my head up before going to sleep as the problem is worst when I first wake up, and now my nasal passages are blocked to wear I can't breathe at all through my nose from wearing the cpap, after using meds, it's just alot of congestion, & the pain has not yet returned but I figure it's just a matter of time. Could I find out if a large turbinate would cause the type of problems I have. The ENT did not want to discuss surgery with my problems not being too bad but when it stops you from being able to wear your cpap, I can't see how that isn't bad. Does the fact that my cpap is making this congestion problem worse make sense with my diagnosis? Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "It is possible that the CPAP is drying your nasal mucosa out, making the mucous even thicker.  The large turbinate probably is worsening symptoms by making your airway smaller.  Have you tried an intranasal medication such as neosynephrine (similar to nasal decongestants)?  These meds are not good long term and generally should not be used for more than 3 days in a row but if you are particularly stuffy one night it might help.  I would encourage you to continue to follow up with your ENT to seek a solution that is acceptible to both you and your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My nose on both sides kept getting blocked and I couldn't get the air I needed through my nose (would even hyperventalate from it) and had to remove my cpap mask so I could breathe through my mouth. It was either that or suffocate to death. It was like the air was obstructed. I understand that happening on one side cause I have turbinate hypertrophy but I don't understand why the other side does that too. Can a turbinate swell & just temporarily enlarge (the other side looked fine on my ct). I think I have inflammation on the inside of my nose cause it bleeds (also see blood in mucus) and it burns alot, or these problems are just from dryness. Is it possible that swelling could occur if my nose is inflammed deeper inside causing such a problem or maybe allergies? Or would thick mucus block the airways? My sleep doctor wants me to quit using my cpap and go on a dental appliance which not only will take months to get (if I did), but my insurance will unlikely pay for it, leaving me without any treatment. In my opinion, the problem needs to be figured out so I can get the right treatment for it. I switched to a comfort gel mask to relieve pressure occuring on my face and bought some nasal gel for the dryness and NasoClear (nasal airflow dilator) which kept my nose from getting blocked up last night. I don't have much pain in my nose this morning since I did that but I don't know how long that is going to work and I am not willing to just give up on treatment with my cpap. So I'm still trying to wear it even though my doctor told me not too anymore. I feel so tired, I can't really help it. Surely there's a reason why this is happening to me & tests that could be done to find out. Could my family doctor check into this cause he's the only one I know that would be willing. Do you know of any tests that may be worth doing or any clue why my nose would block up like that making it so impossible to breathe through?\n\n",

    "content": "All the items you mention can lead to nasal blockage.  Inflammation of the nasal mucosa can occur commonly due to an infection or allergies.  Inflammation often leads to more mucous production which further blocks the airways.  You may want to try taking an antihistamine (anti-allergy) medicine at night to see if it helps clear your nose up.  Also, you may wish to discuss with your doctor about trying a full face mask for your CPAP rather than just nasal prongs.  The face mask will work if you breath through your mouth as well and does not rely on the nose nearly as much.  Having both available will allow you to use the prongs if your nose is well and change to the face mask to give your nose a little break if it starts having trouble.  Just a thought.  If you are unable to make the CPAP work it may be worth the time and effort to look into the dental appliance.  Obstructive sleep apnea robs your sleep and can ruin your days as well.  Getting a good nights sleep is very important.  Best wishes.  I hope this helps some.\n\n",

    "content": "My skin has gotten really itchy since I started using a dehumidifier. The heat still irriates me even when it's on. And the nasal gel & saline solution doesn't relieve the dryness I am getting in my nose again. Now I have post nasal drip and choking when I wake up. It's not at all helpful to remove the humidity. So you was right about that.. I use dish detergent to clean my cpap equipment. Maybe it's not enough to kill the germs. I'll try something stronger. I also ordered a home allergy test kit so I don't have to wait until I see my doctor again. This is a big problem in my family, even w) my kids. We have all always been told it's sinus problems but I am the only one that actually got tested. Maybe we all actually have allergies & was diagnosed with the wrong thing.... if allergies mimic sinusitis. But I'll get this worked out. One other thing that bugs me is when I wake up having problems from breathing, it sounds like I'm in respiratory failure. And everybody else either gasps, chokes, or snorts themselves awake. I can't find any information on the web about why apnea events would do that. An x-ray I had about 2 yrs ago showed mild scarring, but w) this breathing issue & the way I smoke, I wonder if something is happening that shouldn't be. Then again, I worry too much.\n\n",

    "content": "27 year old male, no family history of heart conditions, quit smoking 5 weeks ago, moderately overweight.  Hi,  I've talked to my doctor about my issue and he believes it is nothing to worry about, however I still do occasionally worry about it.  It's difficult to describe but I occasionally have some very moderate chest pain on the right (opposite) side of my heart.  Very difficult to describe the exact feeling but I do often notice it accompanying deep breathing.  Also I have what has turned into permanent numbness in my left pinky finger.  I don't know if numbness is the right word, as I do have sensation in it but it's absolutely somewhat more \"numb\" than any other area on my body.  I'm not sure if there is a relation between the two.  I'm thinking that this could be a damaged nerve in my hand.  In addition to the two above symptons, I often experience muscle spasms in my arms and chest area.  Again, I'm not sure of any relation but as I do notice the chest pain I am concious of other ailments I have.  Any information would be greatly appreciate.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello krzyroone07 - It seems you may have a couple different and benign things going on at once. The right-sided chest pain can pretty well be ruled out as cardiac-related because it is aggravated by deep breathing. That will rule out cardiac causes in nearly every instance of chest pain. What could be causing it is either an inflamation of the cartilege between two of your  ribs, a very common complaint and one that responds well to ibuprofin (Advil, Motrin). It could also possibly be an inflammation of the pleura, the membrane surrounding the lung, although this is usually a rather severe pain that can raidiate up into the shoulder on the affected side upon deep breathing. It also may respond to the same type of medication, but usually is associated with a respiratory infection like pneumonia or bronchitis. Neither of these problems is lasting nor life-threatening, but can be annoying.   The left pinky finger numbness does suggest an unrelated nerve problem, either in your wrist or even in the cervical spine (neck) where the ulnar nerve originates. The two problems would seem to have no connection, and if the numb finger causes you any problem with doing any important tasks you might want to ask a doctor about a possible cause. Otherwise it's not a big concern and could well resolve on its own.  Muscle spasms in your arms and chest could be due to anything from dehydration or overuse to a cervical spine problem such as what might possibly be causing the numb pinky finger. Or it could be essentially a normal \"nothing.\" In any case it is not anything of great concern. Sounds like you are essentially a very healthy young man who may be overly aware of his bodily sensations. Some of us are more that way than others, and so have to learn to filter out the merely nuisance sensations.   Good lucik to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I just wanted any advice you can give please. I started with a pain grabbing sensation under my left arm at around 11:00 PM last night. It was quite bad but bated off and on again all night. Today the feeling is not as bad but it still keeps coming back now and again then easing off again.  I can only describe it as a gnawing dull but painful feeling yet it also feels as if you were to open your hand and close it again it feels like that sensation sometimes more painful than others. Last night the pain went down part of the same arm and I had pain in my finger throbbing sensation which eased after a while.  The thing that is worrying me is that it is still here today much less than last night but if I exert to much it seems to come on more.  Do you think I need it checking out or should i give it another day or so. I have taken some pain tablets but not helping much when it does come on.  Thank you  Robert\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Robert - I apologize for the long delay in responding to your post, but I wasn't a part of the team here when it was posted. At any rate, I hope the problem has resolved by now, but would like to follow up.  You didn't mention your age or any health history, so I am assuming you are a generally healthy male. The sort of pain you describe would normally be highly unlikely, at least in a male subject, to be cardiac related. The character is spasmodic, which sounds more like muscle or even primary nerve pain. The fact that it has radiated down your arm and into a finger makes it only slightly more suspicious to me. However, the fact that is was worsened by exertion and the development, subsequently, of hiccups, does lead me to feel a certain concern and I hope that if the problem didn't go away promptly you were seen by a physician. Sometimes a problem in the lower part of the heart, near the diaphragm, has been known to trigger hiccups in the occasional patient (inferior myocardial infarct). With the limited information I could only, in good conscience, recommend you be seen at once by a physician to rule out any heart problem. However, it has been a long while since your question was posted, so hopefully the matter passed without further incident. Even if it did I would still recommend you schedule a regular physical exam including 12-lead EKG, to rule out any cardiac involvement.  Better to err on the side of caution.    Hope this finds you well and if you're still checking in here, please do update us on what, if anything, became of the problem.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello John,  Just got your reply today. I had forgot all about it but thanks very much for replying to the problem i had at the time.  I will explain a little more now with a little past history.  I am now age 39.  For some years i have had problems at times with my heart rate in it being tachycardia as they always say that to me. They did at one stage give me cardicor i think the name is and another blood pressure tablet both which i no longer take.   Once my heart rate went back to normal they then let me home which sometimes up to a few days or longer.  I have had done some different heart tests but the last one they were going to do was angiogram but with other things going on at the time i never go around to having it done.  Other medical conditions i have is anemia which i am on at the moment 2 iron tablets per day along with folic acid.  I have an ulcer problem to so am on Lanzoprazol for some years now since i had bleeding ulcers but they fixed those by injecting the ulcers in my stomach with something that must stop the bleeding via endoscopy which i have had 5 or 6 in past years.  I do try to keep a way from the doctors if i can but this last Thursday, first time in over a year i have been to see my GP i left it most of the day then decided it was best to go and see if anything was wrong because i had been feeling dizzy for a few days prior and Thursday was much worse because i felt at times as if i was just blank i could not think straight and felt just not with things and dizzy.  He checked my blood pressure which has been high in the past and also did and ECG. The ECG he said was fine and he then checked my blood pressure again which must of also been fine and did a few other basic test..looking in my eyes, ear mouth, and sounded my chest and back.  He just said it may of been just be a one off but could not put his finger on anything specific so told me to just go home and rest a few days.  I did mention the one thing i have had now for quite some years which is pain going up my neck around the back of my ear, chest at times and sometimes into my head. I can't describe it but it is just a very deep feeling sickly pain. They did mention one time i came out of hospital have you got your angina medicine with you at home yet i was never told anything about having angina so i let that go and just said i don't have angina as far as i know.  I do have this quite frequent and up to a few times or more daily at times but with getting used to it now i just go take a glass of water and sit until it lessons for me.  I dare not take to many pain medicines because of upsetting my ulcers so try not to of possible.  The only other thing i can tell you is 2 years ago when i had bleeding ulcers and they fixed that for me is that i was just resting in hospital because i was hoping to be out before the weekend now they had stopped the bleeding.  I was sitting having a snack around dinner time and started all of a sudden getting chest pains, thought nothing of it at first but gradually got worse and worse then i just felt my heart racing that fast that it seemed to be coming out of my chest so i beckoned over to a nurse who came and started doing things ECG etc and called a few doctors who came around to see what was going on..  The ECG they must of done 3 or 4 and it made me much worse i think seeing the ECG has it was coming out of the machine because the lines you see were just so high and all over the place.   They put me on oxygen because my level they said was in the 70s at the time.  Broke a bottle of something for the pain in my chest and injected that which seemed to help a little...the thing is the pains that i have now daily going into my neck and ear are almost the same type but not in intensity as i had when i was in hospital.  They found out what caused the chest pain and my heart rate which seemed to be my potassium level was very low and they just kept giving me potassium drinks for a few more days.  The scary thing is i only found out after why relatives all of a sudden appeared was that the hospital rang them to come so i guess i must of been in a bad way for a time which i knew myself i was how i was feeling but came through it at least.  Anyway that basically tells you little history.  Just a note since last Thursday when i visited my GP i am still feeling dizzy at times with the pains up my neck and palpitations which is why i went up last Thursday.  Only one other difference now for over a year is i sometimes wake up with the pains going up my neck from my chest and sometimes into my ear and head when i am just sleeping and it wakes me up. I again just go get a glass of water and sit up until it lessons.  I think i must be a bit of a mystery but it would be nice to live life without the pain i have so regular and how i have been feeling on and off for years now.  Thank you for your time  Robert\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Robert - I'm so glad you have been checking in here! I'm glad you responded so promptly and so thoroughly, and you definitely have supplied some very important information that may at least in part help explain what's been going on, since the problem seems to still be occurring.  First of all, now that we know you've had sclerotic therapy for bleeding ulcers (and that you've had ulcers at all) we can consider another possibility. At the same time, the pain pathway you describe is suggestive of something more likely non-cardiac in nature despite your strange experience in the hospital.  Also, you are on iron replacement therapy,which also could figure into all this.  Let's start with the primary symptom of the  pain you describe. This sounds very much like  retrograde pain being referred up from the diaphragm, which essentially, on the left side, divides not only the thoracic cavity from the abdominal, but also the heart from  the stomach.  Because of  your distinct history of gastric ulceration it seems more likely that the pain is travelling up the phrenic nerve and may be residual due to disturbance caused by the procedure used to cauterize the bleeding ulcers. There still remains a possibility that the pain could be cardiac in  nature, but it now seems less likely when compared with direct irritation of the  phrenic nerve.   Another  nerve which could  have been irritated or otherwise disturbed during the  procedure is the vagus nerve,which controls not only motility of the stomach and intestines,but also has the job of slowing the heart rate. Vagal stimulation can cause premature  ventricular  contractions  (PVCs), and failure to function appropriately can permit the heart rate to  pick up speed for no good reason. Having  had work done inside your stomach such as you had, both nerves could have been disturbed or irritated and this might well explain the strange episode in the hospital.    It would definitely be in order to rule out the possibility of heart-related disease via angiogram or at least nuclear scan stress test. Ruling out ischemia one  could safely assume the symptoms you're having are, for the most part, related to nerve involvement resulting from the semi-invasive stomach procedure.  Additionally, you were given oral potassium in the hospital following treatment for bleeding ulcers. Oral postassium can reallly irritate the stomach lining. Just an  observation. And along those same lines, iron replacement therapy requires monitoring  of the blood levels of iron, as too much can cause heart injury.   There is no accounting for the comment about the \"angina medicine\", but this is an error that  seems to be fairly common, the assumption that someone who has had chest pains must have nitroglycerine on hand. It is an assumption often made due to inadequate or  inaccurate charting. It  also adds weight to the idea of ruling out cardiac disease altogether, so that  a sound differential  diagnosis can be made and the  appropriate treatment for your symptoms can be given. Pain is pain and at the bottom the goal is to relieve it, but only after being certain of its cause.  I am strongly suspicious of  a GI/nerve relationship rather  than heart, but there is enough overlap of symptoms  to warrant ruling out the heart problems first.   As fior your recent dizziness and feelings of mental cloudiness, I suspect that was a random, inconvenient added symptom which may have been related to a medication or may have been just what your doctor called it, a \"one off\" distraction. I do think your pain is very likely non-cardiac in nature, especially since it has continued, ocurring at rest as well as when in motion, hasn't progressed to anything more severe, and due to the new information regarding your ulcer problems and their treatment.   It would be good to lay this all out in front of your doctor, along with your concerns, so as to feel more comfortable and  maybe even find an acceptable way to reduce or eliminate the now-chronic pain.   Best of luck to you and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi John,  Thanks for explaining that to me it makes a lot of sense.  Could i just ask you a question regarding myself and how i am feeling since last evening.  The reason i thought i would ask here is because i hate to make trips to a doctor when there is no real need and although last Thursday was my first time seeing my GP in over year  i would feel a bit stupid if i have no reason to go.  What happened last night was that i was sitting and started with a pain on my right chest area...just below the breast bone area and right side. What happened is when i took a breath in i got the pain in that spot and in intensity i would say out of 10 it got to 6 or 7 a few times. no problem when i exhaled but just when i inhaled i got the pain.   Thinking it might be trapped wind i went and got a drink of tonic water thinking it being fizzy it would help.  It did not help and so i just went and lay down and was up this morning around 7:30.  The pain had lessoned  and seemed to have gone. Now this afternoon for about 2 hours now i keep getting the same pain in the same place but much less frequent yet very aware it is there.  The only other difference is that the area under my left armpit to the side of my chest feels like a pulsating sensation like as if you got a soft ball and squashed it in your hand and opened it again. that is how i can describe it.  It seems to come on a few times within a matter of minutes then dies down again. Very uncomfortable feeling as i know it won't help but i kind of hold the area when the sensation and pain comes thinking it will lesson.  It's quite bad as i am writing this. The only other difference is the pain on my right side i explained also seems to go through to my back at times..like the pain shoots from the front and into my back on the right side.  Still feeling dizzy at times things seem to spin for a little but then returns to normal. Tiny bit sickly feeling but that is about all.  Any advice if your about would be appreciated.  Best Wishes  Robert\n\n",

    "content": "Hello robert uk - The two things you describe in this post would seem to be unrelated, but given the history they may not be. At any rate, I will give you some rationale for going to a doctor and not feeling silly about it, not that you should ever feel silly, really, in addressing symptoms that have even a remote potential for threat to life or limb. Here goes:  The pain you describe on the left side, in your armpit, could very well be referred phrenic nerve pain from something related to the treatment of the bleeding ulcers. However,  the description has now evolved to the point where I would have it evaluated at once, as it also could describe a rare type of arterial aneurism involving the brachial artery or perhaps a branching off point nearer the aorta. It's probably not, statistically, but if it should be, then it needs to be addressed at once. No advantage in waitng for it to go away, as it has persisted for quite a while and even seems a little more severe now. The description is just too close to what sounds like a vascular accident waiting to happen, even though the actual likelihood is small. (it is a rare location for such a lesion to develop, but they can, especially in people with certain connective tissue diseases which often otherwise go undiagnosed).  As for the pain in the lower right chest, while it could in some way be related to the other pain (especially if they are both the result of an irritation of the phrenic nerve), it first of all does not sound like cardiac pain at all, as it is worsened on inhalation, a good indication that it is not heart related. That being said, if you were to have some fairly obscure connective tissue disease involving the blood vessels, this could also be related to the armpit pain in a far more serious way. It is essential, in my view, to rule out any potential vascular lesions right away, and then work down from there. The goal, absent anything truly serious, would be to at least manage the pain. This, in itself, is certainly sufficient reason to be seen promptly.   Please bear in mind how difficult it is to evaluate in this medium what is really going on in any given patient. We must go with what we do know, and what you have described concerns me enough to urge you to get to a doctor or medical facility promptly to have both complaints evaluated. Odds are they are separate, benign issues, but even a small chance of them being something far more serious makes it a high priority, and pain itself, as I have said already, is reason enough to be seen and to get these things managed.   Please consider my advice in this matter and do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you John.  I have not gone to my GP today anyway as it is after 7:00 pm  and also it has lessoned from what it was but just seems to flare up.  See i am not exactly sure what to explain to my GP would me printing out the topics i wrote here and the replies you made help him understand better what might be going on but hopefully not.  I was also going to have a look for someone in the UK and try and contact them and explain everything and go from there. I mean if things could be sorted out ruling one thing or another out at least i would understand better why i get all theses strange symptoms.  I also forgot to mention my stomach also seems quite bloated at times lately feeling very full yet feeling that way before i have eaten anything and also stomach pains which i put down to ulcers playing up but nothing very painful just the grinding sore like pain in my right lower stomach area when i get it.  Maybe that may also have something to play in all this but i will indeed let you know how i get on with things once i have decided which is the best way to approach my GP or other about it.  Thanks again John  Best Wishes  Robert\n\n",

Also, theres some difficulty in breathing and I find heavy in breathing. This has increased in past few days and now its frequency is almost daily or twice usually during morning and evening hours. I faced the same problem earlier also from last 3-4 years but it was very rarely occuring like once in 4 months and that too when I take stress or eat very oily. I consulted a doctor 2 yrs back when she told me it is gastric problem. So, I took some tablets for digestion and it was temp reliefed. Please suggest me any tests that I should undergo. I am very much worried about whether these symptoms relate to heart trouble, as I have recently got married. Usually my BP remains normal. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Trapti, Based on the symptoms you describe, your doctor may correct in surmising that this may be gastric in origin, although there are other possible sources of your discomfort.  You did not mention what kind of tablets you took that gave temporary relief.  You may wish to ask your doctor if taking an ongoing medication such as Protonix, or even Pepcid OTC, or Zantac OTC may be of value.  Pepcid and Zantac used to be by prescription only but are now available in OTC form at your local major pharmacy.  You mention that these discomforts seem to occur in the morning or evening. I wonder if they occur shortly after breakfast or supper.  This could be significant. If the pain is extreme, it may be a good idea to go to the local urgent care center or emergency room, to be evaluated while the pain is present.  There are more diagnostic tests that can be rule/in or rule/outs for certain disorders that can give you the symptoms you describe, when you present to the ERMD with them.  I certainly appreciate that you are prudent enough to look into the matter - for your health!  And congratulations on your marriage!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 29 yo female. about 9 months ago I went to the ER with chest pain. I was given an ekg & chest xray.  DIagnosis was chest wall pain. I was given an antiinflamitory to take for 10 days. The pains did go away, for about 3 months. There I was again in the ER, same tests same diagnosis, same meds. I got the same results pain went away for a while but came back. This time my doctors office had an opening & I saw my regular doctor, he agreed with the previos diagnosis and gave me arthrotec. Same thing happened pain came back. To the ER I went again this was about 3 weeks ago. This doctor did a chest xray, ekg and blood work to rule out a geart attack. No heart attack same diagnosis diffrent name. This time they called it costochondritis. he gave me hydrocodone for pain and tolmetin. 1 Week to the day later I passed out and was brought back to the ER. This time I told them I had been dizzy for a few days as well and felt like my heart was skipping a beat. Well they looked in my ears and took blood. I was told that I had a retracted eardrum in one ear and an ear infection in the other. I was given a script for meclizine & clarithromycin & sent home. They said if I didnt feel better in 3 days follow up with my regular doctor. Well 3 days later i still felt very weak, dizzy, & heart felt like it was skipping a beat so I saw my regular doctor. He checked my ears said they looked pretty good but I had a little fluid behind my left ear drum. He perscribed guaifenex and told me to make another appointment if I ddnt feel better soon. Well I went back at the begining of this week cuz I still feel weak, and like my heart is skipping a beat. This time he did an ekg, and blood work. He now says I have an irregular heart beat, and sent me to get a holten monitor for 24 hours. Well about 4 hours into that I had to remove the monitor cuz I was allergic to the adhesive. My blood work showed an elevated wbc count so on an antibiotic I went. he had also put me on xanax cuz he felt i was under alot of stress. (my father is in the hospital, & i cried when he said I had an irregular heart beat) I am now gripped with fear that i will die or something bad will happen if I take the pills. I feel the skipped beat and are afraid the meds will make the problem worse. My fathe was given 6 - 12 months to live 13 months ago. he has had multiple heart attacks, strokes, & chf. I fear i will be in his shoes if i don't find out whats wrong with me. I now get tired doing anything. I was in bed most of the day yesterday, got up when the kids were due home & sat on the couch. At dinner time I put bacon in the oven and was totally drained. I had to go lay down, I got up to eat dinner and was wiped out again. I am scared out of my mind and cant even think about taking the meds with out having a panic attack. I know I should take them but I'm afraid of having a heart attack or passing out again and having no one home to call for help. Should I be seing a cardiologist or another specialist? I feel like something is wrong with me but no one has found it. I went from being very active, everyday to not even being able to make my bed every day. please give me an idea of wher to turn.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear hopeydib - I believe you are suffering from a thing I have named \"Horrible Coincidence Syndrome.\" It's not a joke and I do not in the least mean to make light of your suffering. What happens is something turns up that draws the subject's attention toward a certain area of concern, then other things happen, coincidentally, which seem to confirm the person's  worst fears.  You have had a classic presentation of chronic costochondritis. It has been treated appropriately, but has been peristent, and there is probably a reason  for this, something physical you are doing or have done which has aggravated one or more of the costochondral joints in your chest - or you may have a connective tissue disease which shows as flareups of painful cartilginous areas, as well as other, rather random-seeming symptoms.   While all of us on occasion  have \"skipped\" (actually usually premature) heartbeats, they often go unnoticed unless they become frequent or we are under some  unusual stress. You have had a double dose of stress in that you've had this peristent  costochondritis, which caused you to  consider that your heart might be involved, plus you are dealing  with the  seriuos illness of your father,who happens to be suffering from a serious form of heart disease. This certainly qualifies as a \"horrible coincidence.\" The anxiety and stress you've been feeling would provoke more premature heartbeats than  usual, but I assure you that unless you suffer from serious heart disease (in which case you'd  have had a lot of far more serious symptoms before now), premature heartbeats are virtually never of  clinical   significance. In fact, they are almost only of concern in people with advanced CHF  - such  as is your father's case.   Alll that being said,  you did have an increased white count. While the most likely reason is some sort of infection (thus the antibiotics), it also could be caused by a flareup of connective tissue disease. This is something that is often difficult to diagnose in short order, and the antibiotics should be  harmless to your heart. The Guafeinex is  probably the most innocuous medication one can take and has virtually no side effects (and definitely no cardiac ones), and the Xanax will definitely give you at least some short term relief from the mounting anxiety you are experiencing. None of the drugs has even potential cardiac side effects, and no doubt will make you feel somewhat  better.   This appears to be a truly awful coincidence complicated by your rightful and natural concern and anxiety over your father's illness. Xanax is probably the  thing that would afford you the greatest possible short-term relief.  Also some rest and relaxation. If you have either a low-grade infection  or a collagen disease, you would feel run down and low on energy. The anxiety you are feeling would likely take  away whatever \"juice\"\" you might have left.    Nothing to fear from the meds, and I'm convinced of the relative innocence of the chest pain. I' also want  to be very reassuring about the \"skipped\" beats. In a normal, healthy heart they are of no significance at all, but they not only can cause one to feel additional anxiety, but anxiety also causes  more of them. It is a vicious cycle. The Xanax often can serve to break this cycle and actually make them go away or be reduced in frequency.  I hope I have helped ease your concerns some. I will hold  good thoughts for both you and especially your father.   Please do  keep in touch.\n\n",

You have cleared alot up for me and made me feel my worries and concerns were not unfounded or only in my head. We have recived word yesterday that my dad will have to attempt a quadruple bypass, but they feel he may not survive due to other health issues (polio, diabetes, athritis, etc.). You have helped to make me realize his symptoms are not mine they are his & my symptoms are mine. I was researching all my syptoms and only seeing all the bad things it could be not the simple multiple problems it could be. There is 1 reason the internet can be a very bad thing.  I honestly thought I would die suddenly of a heart attack. I do have another question regaurding your answer, well 2 questions. The costochronditis seems to flare when I am not doing much at all sometimes it wakes me up, sometimes its doing dishes is this normal & is there a way to heal it and not have it come back (as it scares the crap out of me each time due to dads history)? Also if it is a connective tissue disease should I be asking for a specific test or doing anything on my own to help this problem? Thanks again for your help and concern.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again - You are very welcome, and I'm glad you're going to take the meds. I think you'll notice a big difference, at least in terms of the anxiety level. Just remember that Xanax has a short half-like (it's supposed to work for six hours but usually goes away sooner than that) and it's best for temporary situations - if you find it becoming ineffective don't just take more; let your doctor know, as there are other drugs in the same family that are better for long-term management of anxiety if that becomes a problem. But it is a great short-term help. It may make some people slightly drowsy, also, although that usually wears off with continued use.  It's a great insight you've gained, that your father's symptoms and illness are not yours. It's very easy to do that reverse projection (there is a correct psychological term for that but it won't come to me now) and take on the symptoms, problems, etc., of another. Another great insight you've shared is the discovery of the two-edged nature of the internet: information without context. It is very easy to learn things about symptoms which, taken out of context can sometimes be terrifying. You are obviously very intelligent, so I'm glad you shared that here where others will read it also.   Costochondritis can be caused by a lot of things, including unwitting postural errors, repetitive upper body tasks (liike lifting a small child with one arm), and also by recurrent viral inflammation (with or without other symptoms), coughing, and, of course, connective tissue disease. I wouldn't want to send you off looking for trouble, as it usually has some very prosaic, boring cause. But if you were to develop other, related symptoms, over time, such as joint pains or other really random, annoying aches, pains, etc., then yes, there are blood tests to determine if there is an autoimmune (connective tissue) disease present, to what extent, and sometimes to narrow it down to a specific one. This isn't something most doctors would do on the basis of a single, localized problem, though, so best to give it a chance to resolve before going on a hunt.   Again good luck to you, and keep us updated.\n\n",

He did say if I had this conditon treatment would depend on the excat diagnosis of cardiologist, but could range from drugs to a pace maker. He told me not to worry, but Hello, he just said I may need a pacemaker. Ok this is where I start to freak out.  My main question is can you tell me in english what this heart block is & if I have it will I be able to lead a normal life with a pacemaker?

    "content": "Hi Hopeydib - One of the most disturbing things a doctor can mention is the possible need for a pacemaker. I think they often forget (or maybe never have realized) what an emotional impact this can have on people. The reason they'd lose track of that fact is that for them, as well as for most modern pacemaker users, it really becomes very nearly a non-issue. Still, it's somethng extra, and it frightens people, usually unnecessarily.   What was seen was a single incidence of 2nd degree heart block. Now he didn't happen to mention whether that was Type One or Type Two, did he? There's a significant difference, and one is far less serious, as a rule, than the other. In either case, however, a single episode of 2nd degree heart block would seem to be a freakish anomaly and probably really does mean nothing. Usually second degree heart block is an established pattern. When it occurs singularly as in your holter monitor test it is most likely either just that (an aberration that means nothing) or a faulty reading on the part of the doctor or the tech who saw it first (sometimes the doctor simply reads the reported findings).   Heart block means that all the regular sinus (normal) hearbeats do not get through the atrio-ventricular node (AV node) that resides between the upper and lower chambers of your heart and helps to keep things orderly. Its purpose, in effect, is to block certain undesireable rhythms or rates from reaching the ventricles and to generally function as a \"hall monitor.\" It can develop some sort of occult disease at times, or be damaged due to surgery or infection, and then it can malfunction and block normal heartbeats. Second degree block, type one, usually isn't very serious, although it can, in some people, cause transient light-headedness. It rarely progresses to a more complicated block. It also is not considered a \"condition\" unless it is constant. Many people can experience a transient block like this without even realizing it, for a number of reasons including the effects of medication, metabolic disturbances, stress, sleep disturbance, etc. This usually passes without notice. It is probably unfortunate that one such occasion of a block showed up on the the Holter tracing, because now it does have to be followed up, and I'm willing to bet it will be found meaningless.   In very rare cases this could be an early sign of disease of the AV node, in which case eventually a person might require a pacemaker. Given the way yours turned up, I find that hightly unlikely, but of course it will require the analysis of a specialist to be absolutely certain that's not the case, and will probably mean a later follow up Holter monitor to see if there is any evidence of such an odd occurrence in a different 24-hour period. If it were me I'd want to be certain, but I also wouldn't be overly concerned, as it really does seem like an aberration, and because pacemakers have become so inoccuous.   A 2-second pause could have been a simple sinus pause, blocked premature atrial contraction (PAC) which occurs more often in normal persons, or even a random, inexplicable, one-time appearance of what most likely would have been second-degree type one block.   By all means go ahead with the follow up, as it will in any case help to reassure you, but go in knowing that a single pause in 24 hours is usually nothing. If the cardiologist decides it is still up in the air after looking at the tracing and doing a 12-lead EKG, then probably a second Holter device would be ordered. If, on the other hand, for some bizarre and unlikely reason you by then are showing a regular pattern of 2nd degree block but are without symptoms, then the cardiologist will hopefully explain the various possibilities and make some suggestions.   This is, I feel certain, a non-issue, but everyone concerned is under a certain obligation to be sure that's the case. The chances of this being anything that would eventually require a pacemaker are very slim, but still worth knowing about. The only thing worse than finding that you might need a pacemaker some day would be to not know. Best case will be a pat on the back and assurance that this is just one of those wierd little things that usually pass unnoticed.   Good luck to you, I hope you find this reassuring, and please do let us know what you find out.\n\n",

This is even less likely than the more worrisome Type  One, but if that's what it was, it is a far less serious issue anway, and still remains a likely freak incident, especially because of the time when it was noted; many transient and innocent one-time blocks are noted during sleep and I'm guessing that at that hour you were either asleep or just recently or partially awake.

He has set me up for an echo and a treadmill test. He feels the costoondritis should have at least cleared up some by now, and because the sypmtom of that is chest pain he wants to make sure that that is an accurate diagnosis (especially due to family history). He said due to the symptoms I have had (weakness, chest pain, head aches, etc) we should at least look into making sure my heart is ok.  He says the echo is a simple test that will show alot (shape & size of heart), & the treadmill will show alot (activity)as well.

Just making my daughter a sandwich was very hard for me to do. I  always felt weak and dizzy, plus due to my body working so hard just to do small and simple  tasks.... I felt  like my heart was going to explode because it was beating so hard and I was very out of breath.\n\n",

    "title": "Shoulder pains after laparoscopic surgery for ovarian cyst",
    "content": "30 yr old female I had laprascopic surgery yesterday to remove a complex cyst on my ovary.  She was unable to remove the cyst as she said my ovary is twisted and attached to my bowel and side wall.  She said I had extensive adhesions that she tried to cut out.  Said we will watch the cyst and if necessary do an open surgery. I woke about 4 am this morning to terrible pain in both of my shoulders going down my arm and into the back of my neck.  Hurts worse when I take a deep breath but seems to go away for a few minutes before it comes back.  I also wanted to note that before my surgery I had 2 Cat scans.  The first one showed Thrombosis of The Inferenal Aorta and the second one said it was more prominent then the previous scan.  Whats wrong with me?  Could this be a heart attack or something from the thrombosis?  My doctors office isnt open yet but I will call as soon as they do.  No pain in my chest just a tight kinda like pulling sensation.   Please answer as quickly as possible.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Onelildarlin2u,  It sounds that you have an extensive medical history.   After laparscopic surgery, i think it is allowed to have some shoulder pains, however, i think they should not be so severe. The pains that you have do not sound typical of heart attacks.  Your history of aortic thrombosis makes me worried, otherwise, being a young female in the child bearing period usually protects against heart attacks.   The aortic thromosis could be caused by inflammation of the wall of the aorta that might be caused by a condition known as Giant cell arteritis amongst others.   If this has not already been done, i think that you should be evaluated for such diseases.  i think you should be evaluated by your doctor as soon as possible.

Chest pain such as you have described could be the signal of a heart attack, or MI (myocardial infarct).  There are tests that can be done in the Emergency room including lab work, and ECG/EKG (Electrocardiogram), that may help differentiate between pain that may be epigastric, or muscular from cardiac.  Then, if warranted, they can schedule an Echodoppler, and even a Stress test to determine if he has a heart condition that needs attention. Any chest pain needs to be assessed by an MD, and especially when the sufferer is over the age of 40.  Heart disease is a killer, but there are many interventions that are available to prevent heart attacks. Please have him see his doctor to find out which ones are appropriate for him.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there...here is my story... I am a 35 year old woman with constant palpataions, so much that I could tell you my heart rate without a stethescope for it pulsates my whole body.  Anyway, about 2-3 weeks ago I started getting some nausea, fatigue and dizziness.  The nausea was sometimes fixed with food, the palpatations have become strong pressure on the chest, pain at the xiphoid process, pain in the left posterior side of neck, as well as palpatations between my scapula, tightness down my back and under the left scapula.  The nausea subsides when I DON\"T eat now, rather than the opposite.  I eat because I have to, but not sure how long I can take it.  Within the last 2 days I have had near syncopal episodes with a very cloudy, heavy head feeling, (tingling in the hands and feet and got very diaphoretic).  I initially thought I was getting the flu, but with all this pressure, I am starting to get scared. A brief HX:  No family hx of any heart conditions, father was a victim of Vietnam and the Agent Orange and has Type II DM (adult onset and other severe medical problems, every system is failing with the exception of heart at this time and MOM has no medical problems whatsoever.  Sisters have had benign brain tumor and fibroid tumors, brother is mentally slow.   A big thing I need to mention, I stopped taking ephedra about a year ago after taking it for about 10 years. (I bought in bulk before it went off the market).  Could this be something?  I work in a hospital and know the staff at the ER and wish not to have others know about my ailments.  I was hoping it turned out to be the flu, but now I think I need to tell someone (you), then decide if I may need to see someone else.  If at all I can avoid it, I'd rather wait it out, but my 3 year old may also want me to feel better.  Sorry so lengthy, ME\n\n",

I went back to him a week and half later as pain was coming more frequent.He said it was same thing and gave me ibuprofen. I took that for nearl;y a week and it didnt help.I started to get the pain at night and noticed my heart seemed to beat faster sometimes when I had the pain.I decided to go to a diff.gp and he said I had a slight murmur.he sent me for an ecg which was ok and then for a chest xray.I wont get the results til next week. The pain can last sometimes 15mins and then sometimes an hour.I'm not taking anything for the pain as nothing helps.I feel very drainned and just want to sleep all the time.

Another very common cause of chest pain is pleurisy.  I suspect this may be the case in your situation.  It is commonly mistaken for costochondritis.  This pain is generally made worse by taking a deep breath.  It come from an area of the lining of the lungs that is inflamed.  Deep breathing or moving causes the lining to move against the chest wall and irritates it.  The pain can occur off and on for a few seconds or longer.

    "title": "Flutter / Spasm / Brief Empty Feeling in Chest",
    "content": "Hello there.  I've noticed that most of the people posting in this forum are in the same age range as I am.  This brings a bit of comfort in knowing that we can all worry about things that likely are not nearly as bad as we think they are.   I am a 24 year old white male, I am 6'7'', 275 lbs.  I played college football and besides the last two years I have been an athlete since I could walk.  My grandfather on my Father\u2019s side died of a heart attack in his late 50s / early 60s (I can't recall), my Father is 56 and has no history of heart issues to my knowledge.  My Mother was adopted and I do not know that side of my family\u2019s history.  I have been diagnosed with and experiance very infrequent migraines and I am currently taking no meds.  To put the ghosts on the table, I am in a fairly high stress sales position that requires long hours, I do not exercise regularly anymore, I chew tobacco and drink 4 or more cups of coffee a day.  I have a feeling that all of that sounds awful and even typing it makes me laugh at myself and cringe all at once.  I also understand that all four are risk factors that I can control, but all else being equal I felt I should ask my question anyhow.  About twice a day I have an interesting sensation directly in the center of my chest; behind my sternum.  If my limited knowledge of anatomy is correct the heart is positioned there, leaning to the left.  The sensation lasts less than a second and is something that I can only describe as a flutter, spasm or something like an empty feeling.  I experience no pain directly related to this sensation and more or less all it does is make me take notice.  It typically does not make a difference if I am moving, sitting or lying down, but I do tend to notice it more frequently if I bend over to pick something up...  Almost like my heart is swinging and hitting my sternum, but I'm not sure if that's possible.   At other times during the day I will feel a pain that is localized to the left side of my chest, behind my left pec., below my nipple that will last for 30 seconds to 2 minutes.  Sometimes this pain is followed by a brief pain in my left collarbone, I would say this subsequent pain happens about 25% of the time.  In reading other posts it sounds like localized pain, especially below the nipple is not typically related to cardiac issues but I thought I should mention it given the other sensation I am experiencing and the infrequent subsequent pain in the collarbone that follows.  I appreciate any input a doc may have.  I understand the time crunch all of the medical professionals who respond to these post are under and I am very grateful for your contribution.  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Sandos: While I am not a doctor I am an allied health professional with fairly deep experience in cardiology, and feel I can possibly share some useful insights.  The sensation you describe in your chest would probably be assumed by most medical people to be palpitations of some sort. We tend to find a recurrent theme in the descriptions, and the \"flutter...spasm\" part as well as that \"empty\" sensation after, are both classic descriptions of premature atrial or ventricular contractions. These are almost never serious in nature, but if noted by a person they can be annoying and anxiety producing. That alone is reason enough to at least discuss them.   The added mention of a sensation as though your heart were swinging forward against the sternum is one I have not heard before, but is consistent with palpitations.   You have been frank in describing the \"controllable risk factors\" related to your lifestyle. It seems very likely that modifying these could reduce the frequency of these unpleasant sensations, so I won't go on about that. You know what you need to do there.   The sub-mammary pains you feel sound very non-cardiac in nature, although of course to be absolutely certain of this you'd have to be examined by a qualified medical doctor. I would say they are of the sort rarely associated with heart problems.  All that having been said, there is something I would suggest just for your own peace of mind: since you describe yourself as an overall large person (tall, very well-developed) and an athlete as well, and since this profile is one most likely to be associated with a certain type of cardiomyopathy (hypertrophy or thickening of the muscle composing the walls of the left ventricle, or LVH), it might be wise, given your habits, your build, and your athleticism, to ask your doctor to refer you for a simple echocardiogram to rule out the possibility of any thickening of the left ventricle. Chances are this would be completely normal, but a disproportionate number of athletes, especially very dedicated ones with large frames, seem to have this problem, which often can be managed, if need be, with medication. And of course certain lifestyle changes per your list of personal habits.   There is also a small but discrete family history of cardiac disease in that your grandfather died at a relatively young age of a heart attack. Taking those things into consideration it probably would be prudent to be screened for LVH. I am sure you know what you need to do about the \"controllable risk factors\" you have listed.   I hope this puts your puzzle pieces into perspective and perhaps leads you to get yourself checked. Meanwhile I hope you will begin to modify those self-imposed risk factors. The earlier we start modifying risk factors, the better.\n\n",

However,  the treadmill part noted this abnormality: \"She developed 0.5mm horizontal ST depression and T-wave inversion in leads II,III,aVF and V4,5,6. In these leads there is baseline ST/T abnormality.\"  The nurse wasn't able to do a very good job of explaining what this meant but she said chances were good that since the rest of the echo was fine that this is probably nothing to worry about.

    "content": "Hello mtstreet - Somehow this post escaped my attention earlier. My apologies. I will give you my best answer.  The nurse most likely wanted to remain non-committal about her comments, since to state anything concrete would be to go before the doctor in interpreting the tracings from your stress test. It also would be a questionable finding, as ST deviation is generally considered ischemic when it exceeds .5 mm, so this an equivocal or borderline finding that must be read in the context of the rest of the information on a given patient. Also, flipped T-waves are often a very non-specific finding although, again, it depends upon context.   The nurse actually gave a good answer; those would be non-specific findings (and so not diagnostic of anything) in an otherwise healthy person. Whether or not your doctor  considers you to be such a person will depend on his assessment of all the evidence. In a vacuum those abnormalities could have little to no meaning.  I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Thanks as always for your thoughtful response.    As you said, it's important to look at the results in the context of the big picture.  The inverted T-waves and S/T depression are the only abnomalities noted except for mild thickening of mitral valve leaflets, mild mitral annular calcification and \"borderline enlargement of left atrium.\"  However, the left atrium measurement was 3.1, which is within range. Hmmmm.....  From what I've read there isn't anything the doctor noted that I need to be overly concerned about so I don't understand why  the conclusion was \"abnormal.\"  I showed no signs of exercise-induced ischemia, METS was 10.5  and I was able to reach target heart rate and stay on the treadmill for 9.5 minutes. So why \"abnormal?\" Do doctors usually put this if there is any variation at all from the norm?  Also - and here comes a dumb question - under \"symptoms\" it listed dypsnea.  I did mention my problem with fatigue but did not mention that I do on ocassion suffer from SOB.  So was the dypsnea something that was noted by the tech during the test?  Last thing - and then I'll shut up : ) - the report says \"cannot accurately asses regurgitation from aortic valve because of a \"shadowing by the prosthesis.\"  (I have a mechanical vallve.) I've had annual echos for the past 8 years and this has never happened.  What causes a shadow?  My cardio appointment is in a couple of weeks but I have a feeling it'll be a very short one because there doesn't appear to be anything wrong!   Thanks again for any insight.   Cheers!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again! This is actually all good. I know - because it happens all the time - that vague or less-than-concrete documentation often causes an enormous amount of concern among people who are actually just fine. The use of the term \"abnormal\" is actually \"normal\",  in that healthcare professionals are ever more careful to document with the utmost  accuracy, and so if .5 mm variation in the  ST segment, for instance, does not meet the definition of normal, which it doesn't, then it will be noted as \"abnormal\",  even if it is acceptable. Again,  the context determines that, and the context was negative, which, paradoxically, is a positive thing. (\"negative\" usually is a positive thing in  medicine). So as for that part, as I expected, you're fine.  By the same token, things like atrial enlargement are common and not normal as a rule, and must be documented. In your case, this time, however, it was a relative enlargment, and so while WNL,  it  is a change. Changes from baseline findings are always noted, for future reference. This way a trend can be spotted over time if appropriate. (Atria often seem to change size  somewhat, but if  one  continued to become more enlarged  over time, one would be able to tell). Just like an \"abnormal\" EKG is often \"normal\" for a given individual, it still must be noted as abnormal in the grand scheme of thinigs, mainly because it makes  changes more difficult to pick out if they should occur, or if symptoms  appear, one would need to know those abnormalities don't signify a change.   Your stress test, both subjectively and objectively, was very good! You achieved double-digit METS, which is great, and again, yes, doctors do routinely note  the not-normal as  \"abnormal\", even if it  is fine. Sounds crazy, but trust me, it's  for the  best, even if it's dyspnea on a treadmill (and more will have that happen than not, and it  will be noted).   As for that \"shadow\" thing, it is some sort of  doppler artifact that  happens sometimes, mostly in women, because of normal (or abnormal) distribution of body fat. As the equipment  becomes more sensitive I hear this finding more and more. It's something that will have to be addressed through ongoing technical improvements, but right now it happens a lot, and anything gross would have shown up in other ways anyway.   Sometimes we're better off not having all the available information, unless someone is going to sit down and explain all the details in it! Many providers I  have known do actually make a practice of passing along a layman's translation of what is actually useful information. I wish  more would do this, as the clinical notes can be pretty scary taken out of context.   Sounds like you're doing great. Keep doing what you're doing.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 24 year woman who until last year was a competitive athlete. I stopped training and only exercised occasionally as I was enrolled in college and did not have the time. I have what my doctors have called an innocent heart mummer, and when I was sixteen had an EKG and ultrasound that Doctor's said was innocent.  In October, when I was under great stress (midterms, my family was trying to buy a home, my car broke down and I had to wake up every morning at 5am and run about 1 mile to make a bus and then walk about another mile to school w/o much food because I didn't have time to eat, I was basically drinking black sugary coffee all day). Yes, I know it was unhealthy and I haven't done it since but about month into that hectic schedule I began experiencing fluttering heart palpitations.  They were frequent at first but overtime and as conditions became less stressful the fluttering lessened. However, they occurred more frequently while I was eating, especially chicken. So I stopped eating chicken and the fluttering only came about once a week.  Now there's no fluttering but just one misbeat that is what I believe to be long though it lasts less than one second. It occurs very infrequently but I sacred of what it could be. If anyone has experienced anything like this or is a doctor or in the medical profession and have some insight please let me know. Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello lexicat22 - The symptoms you describe sound very much like benign premature heartbeats, either premature atrial contractions (PACs) or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). While almost everyone has some of these at some times, some of us have more than others, and while some are totally unaware of them, others feel every one. People who have mitral valve prolapse (MVP), an almost always innocent variation of normal which is sometimes accompanied by an \"innocent\" click murmer usually feel more of these little \"blips.\"  When one experiences a period of sustained stress (as you certainly did fairly recently) the premature beats may become much more frequent and more noticeable. Once they start and attract attention to themselves, they often become self-perpetuating because the anxiety produced by one can cause the release of adrenaline, which only serves to trigger more.  This can become a really annoying and bothersome cycle,  which usually trails off until the next stressful life event.   In any case these premature beats are not dangerous, except insofar as the anxiety they cause can be very disruptive.   These little \"misfires\" also normally happen at certain specific times: when we are falling asleep or sometimes just changing to a more comfortable resting position (especially lying on one's left side), when eating (swallowing sometimes can trigger them because the vagus nerve, which controls slowing of the heart rate is so near the esophagus), digesting of food, times of anxiety or stress, after consuming caffeine, etc. The list goes on and on.   Each premature beat is followed by a pause, while the heart resets itself in order to keep the underlying rhythm the same (that is to say, if one beat comes early in an otherwise regular string of beats, the heart pauses for a moment until the next regular beat \"should\" occur). This can easily approach a full second, if you take into consideration that a fit person's heart rate may only be 60 per minute anyway (or lower). This is called a \"compensatory pause\" and suggests an overall normal rhythm broken only by the occasional early beat.   I strongly suspect the swallowing of chicken to be coincidental, or maybe you have a fondness for chicken and eat it frequently? It would be a shame to give up something you like because of this, especially since poultry is fairly healthy food.   In short, these are not a reason for concern, but many people do feel uneasy because of them. The best medicine in most cases is reassurance. I hope I've accomplished that.\n\n",

    "content": "Just a bit of background: female, 50, aortic valve replacement and aneurysm repair in 1999, on coumadin, Tegretol (for complex partial seizures), Actonel and Crestor.   My last echo in February of 2006 was fine except for mild mitral regrug and mild mitral annular calcification. All blood work fine - bad cholesterol is 118 but good cholesterol is 105. Trigclyerides about 50. Fasting glucose fine.   I walk for an hour or so every day and the only problem I seem to deal with is fairly frequent bouts of fatigue. I often tire right after I've done my walk - almost immediately after I sit down I'm ready to go to sleep!  I find this very odd since I've been doing this same walking routine for years.   I recently had a scary episode when for two mornings in a row  I got up and felt  not so much dizzy as pretty off balance. I started  to feel lightheaded, woozy, and my vision became blurred. I was also a bit sweaty. It didn't  last long - maybe three or four minutes - I laid down and then was  ok, though a bit weak for a few more minutes.  It hasn't happened again since, though I have experienced brief episodes of lightheadeness and a bit of dizzyness.   I thought it might be low blood pressure and later on took my blood pressure while lying down and then after standing up for one minute and three minutes. There was hardly any difference in the readings.  Tried it again with the same results.   I saw my doctor, who said he thought it was vasovagal syncope.  He then did  an EKG which showed \"septal infarct, age undermined.\"  I was a bit worried about this and wonder how reliable EKGs are.  Is there a good chance that this is a false positive? My echo from two years ago says \"Abnormal septal motion noted and is consistent with post-op state.\" Can you tell me what this means? Could this have been what the EKG picked up as a septal infarct?   Thanks in advance for any advice. I'm having a stress echo soon but worry that my mechanical aortic valve is starting to go bad on me.  Thanks again.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello mtstreet - First of all, good that you brought this issue to your doctor's attention, given your history. Your doctor seems to be not especially concerned, which should be encouraging, but unfortunately sometimes has the reverse effect, especially when small details go unexplained (like that old \"septal infarct\", an abnormality picked up in women erroneously often enough by the computerized EKG machines). In this case there are several things which  need to be addressed. First, that old septal infarct finding, which in many cases is a misleading artifact and in your case could very well be related to the \"abnormal septal motion\" finding of your echo, which does seem as though it could be consistent with the surgery. Also, since your doctor didn't make anything more of it, it seems likely it is just another case of the machine applying the handiest label available, as the EKG machines contain a finite number of observations, and never leave anything uncommented on. If the doctor read your EKG then his reading is the interpretation that counts. The machine just comes as close as it can to what it \"sees.\"   Hopefully that clears that part up. The episodes of weakness, faintness, etc., are quite another thing, and it seems your doctor has that one pinpointed too, although he may not have offered an explanation as to why this should be happening. There is one possible reason, though, depending upon where your aneurism repair was located: there is an area in the ascending aorta which is the location of a nerve center called the Sinus of Valsalva; This helps keep blood pressure adjusted, and could have been disturbed by your surgery (if surgery was in the upper portion of the aorta, which I am guessing it was due to the simultaneous aortic valve replacement). Your symptoms do describe simple vasovagal episode. These can occur in anyone at any time, while some people report having them on predictable occasions from adolescence on. People who have had heart, aortic or other thoracic surgery sometimes can have random new-onset symptoms like these because of disturbance of the sinus of Valsalva and/or the vagus nerve itself.   There's probably nothing serious going on, but your doctor is the best judge of that, and seems to feel the same way. While a near-faint can be upsetting, so long as it doesn't happen frequently and is preceded by some warning signs, it probably only has annoyance value.   Good luck to you.\n\n",

I couldn't tell whether or not he was overly concerned (the vasovagal syncope diagnosis was made prior to the EKG)  but he set me up with a stress echo next week. That should show them more of what's going on and I'm sure the infarct finding is a false positive.     You're right - my surgery in '99 did include the repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm. The whole operation became more complicated  due to the scar tissue left over from my first surgery, which caused my right ventricle to become stuck underneath the sternum. Apparently it's still stuck there!    I guess I'm just trying to find an explanation for my decreasing energy/fatigue  over the past year or so.  Blood work always comes back fine.  I know I'm getting older, but...  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - Yes, the stress echo is appropriate and should show up any structural abnormalities that aren't already known, if there are any. Of particular interest would be the possibility of finding an increase in adhesions (that scarring that caused your RV to become \"stuck\" to your sternum). Anything that interferes with the free motion of the RV can conceivably cause some mild right failure symptoms (often without any obvious signs such as swollen ankles or pitting edema in the calf or ankle). If that's the case then it could be the culprit in your decreased energy  levels. It would then become a question of whether or not it would be worth the trouble it would take to correct that.   The ascending aorta surgery may well have disturbed that sinus of Valsalva, and that opens the possibility of some random vasovagal episodes. When you consider that some people have those most of their lives for no particular reason (it's just a reflex - somtimes triggered by things like having blood drawn) it's not too bad, but can be annoying. Again, so long as you have adequate warning that it is happening it poses little problem. If you were to faint abruptly from time to time that raises some ancilary issues like bumping your head on something, but it doesn't sound like you are prone to just \"fall out\" like some less forunate people.   Please keep us updated, especially regarding any findings (or lack of them) from the stress-echo.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again,  Hmmm...it's interesting that you should mention potential right failure.    My past two echos have shown an increase in the RVID, which I assume is the measurement of the right ventricle.  Two years ago the measurement was 2.3 and last year it had increased to  2.9.  This measurement is  still in normal range but the sheet says that the RVID measurement should be <3.0 so it's getting towards the high end of normal.  The IVS wall  had also increased from .08 two years ago to 1.0 last year. According to the sheet this should be between .6 and 1.1 so again, this is in range but creeping up  towards the high end of normal.   The LV post wall, LVID and left atrium measurements were all fine.    I understand that echo results may vary due to the skill of the  technician and the doctor reading it, so the differences in the last two echos might be due to that.  However,  would an increased RVID signal right side failure?   Thanks in advance for any further information.   Cheers!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there - That is interesting. There is almost always some latitude in the reading of echos, but an increase of .6 may well indicate some relative dilation. If the increase in the size of the RV is true, it could be due to some stretching caused by it working against the adhesions. This could cause some mild failure symptoms and might conceivably explain the gradual loss of energy, or it could be strictly coincidental. As I go back and read your initial description of your fatigue after exertion, it almost sounds reflexive, which could as easily be attributable to a change in autonomic response. It's a remarkable coincidence, though, given all the other factors.   So long as the RV doesn't dilate significantly beyond normal limits and the fatigue and energy loss don't affect your ability to function, it is probably something to just keep an eye on. If it is due to scar tissue adhesion it would require a surgical procedure to relieve it, so your best bet is to just make sure it is watched and, of course, if you develop any new symptoms or a marked increase in the ones you've mentioned, that should be brought to the attention of your doctor promptly. Otherwise it's probably just something your body may be working to accomodate. The RV is pretty adaptable and often will remodel itself in response to changes which affect it.\n\n",

I imagine the second surgery added even more scar tissue.  If I recall correctly, the surgeon during my second operation did try to get the RV unstuck and ended up making a hole in my heart somewhere that had to be repaired. If he couldn't get it unstuck then I wonder if it can even be unstuck at this point.  If it stays stuck, does that pose any long-term risks? I sure have more questions to ask now.    All I know is that I want my energy and my brain power (which seems to have decreased by about 50%) back.  : )   Thanks for your insight and if you can think of anything else I should ask please let me know. I can't wait for my stress-echo.  Cheers!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again - Yes, it is probably the fact that you were still within normal limits, plus the margin of possible error, that the change wasn't mentioned. However, the relative change vs. what was \"normal\" for you is what is important, and it seems to be a fairly sizeable change. It may well be that the RV is now remodeling itself to accomodate the fact that it is working against some \"drag\" in that area. The heart is generally pretty resilient, so it could take a good long time for this to become evident.   Do you know whether the hole you mentioned being caused by attempted freeing of the RV was in the heart muscle itself or just in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart? The latter is usually what gets \"stuck\" against the chest wall or other structures, and causing a hole or tear in it isn't usually a terrible thing (it is sometimes done to relieve pressure from fluid buildup inside the sac in inflammatory conditions, in fact). It sounds like it is pretty firmly attached to its moorings now, and probably is just accomodating slowly to this.   If the fatigue can be traced to some other cause (entirely possible) then you could probably forget about the adhesion problem altogether. If it is determined that this is the cause for your loss of energy, then there are ways of possibly managing the problem medically without further surgery. Fortunately the RV, while necessary, is not the real workhorse like the LV is, so it is permitted a little more slack in most situations.   I think ruling out other, non-cardiac possible causes of your energy loss probably should be the first order of business, and that being done, to see if there is anything practical that can be done to \"tighten up\" the RV's performance. I doubt that there would be any extensive long-term harm done by the  \"stuckness\" so the important thing is to find out exactly what is causing your fatigue. It may be something totally unrelated to this peculiar feature.   Please do keep in touch.\n\n",

I had also been having a \"detached\" feeling as if my head was in the clouds.   This has been occurring off and on for several months.  The Dr. sent me for EKG, Chest X-Ray and Nuclear Stress Test.  All came back normal.  A full physical was also performed by my primary care physician, along with blood work.  Again, all normal.  I continue to have these symptoms on a rather infrequent basis (once / day).  I also am now having head aches / head flutters on the right side of my head, along with some other minor and random aches and pains.   I am a rather stressful person, but am at a loss right now if I should pursue additional tests or chalk this up as anxiety / stress.   I currently am not taking any meds.\n\n",

    "title": "? unstable angina ?",
    "content": "Hello. I am a female, morbidly obese, and almost 40. I have not been hospitalized before, or had any diagnosed diseases. My last check up was about 3 years ago, and my cholesterol, triglycerides, blood sugar, insulin, and blood pressure were all normal. About 2 weeks ago I began having chest pains, in the center of my chest. Other than a few lighted headed moments (I think more from panic than shortness of breath) my only other symptom was a hollow feeling in my chest, and a tingling. The pain lessened when I moved around or bent over, and increased when I sat down or layed down. After reading several posts here, I got worried that this sounded a lot like unstable angina. The posts I read said the angina is unstable if it comes on quickly and for the first time, and if it gets worse when resting or laying down, and this fits my symptoms.   I was going to go to the emergency room last night, but  then last night the pain just went away. I got a feeling of numbness in my chest, and a slight tingling, and a feeling of being full, like I'd just eaten (but I hadn't). I went to sleep without any chest pain, and woke up without it. Over time today though I've felt strange (hard to describe). Slightly light headed (but could be from stress or mild panic), kind of hollow feeling, some tingling in my breasts or center of chest, and a few times a slight pressure pressing down on my chest, with just a few moments of pain here and there, but nothing as bad as before.  Does this sound like unstable angina? If the pain is gone should I not worry, or should I still go on to the emergency room. From what I've read, it could be chest wall pain or pain from chest muscles (I did sit in one position for a couple of weeks before Christmas, working on craft items for school, for several hours each day), or it could be a hundred other things. Any help or advice or information would be greatly appreciated. This has me really scared. Thank you, Carol\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Carol - Last things first: anterior chest pain that is new and suspicious, such as you describe, needs to be evaluated whether it has stopped or not. While this may well not be related to coronary artery disease, it could be. There is no advantage to waiting to see what might happen next.   I do believe you have some good insights into what's  going on and that the lightheadedness might well have been due to anxiety; most people experiencing unstable angina will  rightly feel some degree of anxiety. If it is only anxiety, perhaps combined with some other, less serious problem, great. But if not, watiing will only make correction of the problem more difficult and add to the risks.   One thing you've described, the fact that the pain lessened when  you stood up and/or moved around does not sound like unstable angina, which may begin at rest, but will  only become worse with exertion. Also  you noted the pain got worse when  you sat or lay down. Two rather  likely causes of this are a) sliding hiatal  hernia and b) an inflammation of the sac enclosing the heart (pericarditis). The latter is painful especially when  lying  down and is relieved by sitting up and leaning forward.   What seems most likely is anxiety over the possibility of heart disease, combined wth a sliding hiatal  hernia, but there is only one way to be certain and that is to have a competent and thorough cardiac workup. I would strongly recommend you have  this done at the earliest opportunity and if the pains should  return that you get yourself to an emergency department for more prompt evaluation. Even though it sounds more like a non-cardiac problem, there is no way to be certain of that  without a hands-on exam. Women are more inclined to have atyipical cardiac presentations anyway, so I would encourage you to put your fears to rest and/or get on the right track to resolving a more serious  problem and not wait  for it to flare up again.   When  in doubt, always err on the side of caution.   Please let us know how things go. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Zena: While your rib pain is certainly far from typical for any sort of cardiac problem, pain is still uncomfortable at best, and serves the purpose of letting us know something needs attention. You don't mention any other potentially cardiac-related symptoms, While a visit to a cardiologist will  probably bring you some much-needed peace of mind where the heart is concerned, the cause of the pain in the left lower ribs may well go unresolved.   Usually this sort of pain is caused by costrochondritis, an inflammation of the cartilage between the ribs, and can be recurrent, chronic, and intermittent, as you have described. It often responds to an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory analgesic (ie: ibuprofen or naproxyn). This sort of pain can be caused or aggravated by certain maneuvers we perform unconsciously (such as lifting a small child) or can sometimes have no clear cause. A bruised rib would have resolved long before now, but in inflammation of the connective tissue between the ribs can come back again and again. It can be quite annoying at times. There are also other structures withing the chest and abdomen, especially in that area, which can refer pain, as the splanchnic flexure of the colon is located nearby, and accumulation of air in that organ sometimes gets trapped at that point, causing pain the the upper left quadrant, lower ribs, beneath the left breast or even up into the shoulder.   In short your problem seems most likely a chronic irritation of the material between those lower left ribs, and is usually quite benign. If you have any doubts or it becomes intolerable, you will need to bring it urgently to the attention of your doctor, who would likely recommend an anti-inflammatory agent to manage it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello HotChi9103: Dr. Mahmood has given you a very excellent and thorough reply. I would only add that with Panic Disorder there is a problem that turns up probably more frequently than realized, known as nocturnal panic attacks. These are slightly more problematic because they often wake the subject from sleep and the subsequent, if brief, disorientation makes the experience more alarming (if that is possible) than a waking episode.   It sounds very much as though that's what you've been experiencing. This phenomenon is also, in some instances, accompanied by a related one known as sleep paryalysis, in which the patient wakes up but feels breathing to be extremely difficult and temporarily seems to be unable to move, then suddenly sits bolt upright, hyperventilating, and feeling as though something awful has just happened. These two together account for a very high number of ER visits in the US.   By all means follow Dr. Mahmood's excellent advice and the links provided. Also follow up with your personal physician, as these episodes can often be well-managed with fairly inoccuous medication if they are persistent and disrupt your life or your sleep.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am 23, female, and I've always been very healthy, with slightly high blood pressure.  My mom and one of my sisters have heart murmers, and my dad takes medicine for high blood pressure.    This is what's bothering me:  My heart had been beating fast, and I'd been having palpitations, and what feel like flutters, and chest pains for about a week.  I also had a constant low fever (about 99.0-99.4).  I stopped having any caffeine after two days of this.  I saw a doctor finally a week ago, and had a EKG, which was normal.  He tested my thyroid hormones, and said they were normal too.  He gave me 10mg Inderal to take 3 times a day, and referred me to a cardiology clinic, which I haven't been to yet.  He told me he thinks I'm fine, and that this is probably all due to anxiety, but that I should get checked just to be sure.  I've been taking the inderal, which really helps the anxiety, but I've been feeling dizzy a lot of the time and my chest aches and I get out of breath when I exert myself even a little.  The center of my back, between my shoulder blades, feels sore.  I am a bit anxious about everything, so I've been very tense, which might be causing the back ache.  Also, for the last two days my stomach has been feeling very swollen and achy.  It hurts mostly along the bottom of my ribs, and especially right in the center if I press down a bit. I don't know if this is related or not.  I feel like my heart beats strangely when I lie down flat, and that it's better when I'm sitting up and even walking slowly.  I think I've been having trouble sleeping because of this.  Probably unrelated: I also have a firm lump, about 1cm across, that seems to be attached to my sternum.  It doesn't hurt unless I rub it a lot.  I forgot to mention it to my doctor.  I am just curious to know what might be going on, and whether it's anything I should be really worried about.  I don't have health insurance, but the clinic I was referred to is very affordable, though I don't know how long I will have to wait for an appointment.   Thanks for your advice in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves. They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest.  The swelling and chest pain may be related to costochondritis a condition in which there is inflammation where the ribs are attached to sternum. The swelling is usually tender.  In many cases it is of idiopathic origin. In others it results from direct trauma, aggressive exercise by a strain, or a prior upper respiratory tract infection with cough resulting in stretching and strain at the costochondral junction. You have mentioned that you have low grade fever in the last period, did you have any attack of respiratory tract infection and cough recently? .  Viral infection may cause both pain in the costochondral joint and palpitation as well. However, in case of chest pain, especially with family history, cardiac causes should be excluded. MVP (mitral vulvae prolapse is a common cause of palpitation and diagnose by echocardiography.  Sometimes chest pain is not originating from the chest itself; instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include IBS, gastritis, gall bladder disease, GER. The pain and tenderness you feel at the lower sternum could be related to one of these causes.   Stress and anxiety alone can cause chest pain, epigastric pain and palpitations. They also aggravate the condition causes by most of the above diseases.  Hope this information is useful. Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi - i posted in the wrong catagory I think last week ... i need to have some input on my chest / breathing symptoms and the test results I have received. Below I copied the previous post which describes all the symptoms I have had and the ECG results that evening.   I recently had the blood work come back including the cholesterol levels and the results are below as well.  All I really need at this point is a professional opinion of whether I should insist a stress test and maybe other tests like the ultrsound (?) of the heart itself.   I am concerned due to my risk factors and my current family medicine doctor has stated that I do not have significant factors however - even I know this is incorrect. What should I do ?  I am still having mild symptoms of the ones described below.  do I insist on this doctor to do more tests or do I go outside of my health program and get a second opinion out of pocket ? Help !!  Thank you for any help you can give on this situation.  I appreciate it.

I currently take Beconase nasal steroid spray for allergies and started one month ago allergy shots for dust and Ash tree allergy immunotherapy (lowest dose available to load up on and only once a week due to sensitivities to two shots per week).  I weigh 125 lbs and have always had generally good heath.   My family has SERIOUS heart related dieases through-out all of my fathers 7 siblings with one (congenital murmer present) in a sister whom died in her sleep at age 27. My father and all his brothers had early Heart attacks causing them to all have open heart double or triple bypasses (currently COPD and Aortic vale replacement) and the sisters whom were still living, - one died of brainstem Stroke after starting \"colesterol medication two weeks earlier\" and the other two have had serious MI's with later open heart surgeries. Another of my dad's brother s(younger) died of cardiac arrest at age 50 during basketball game - he had previous stents and balloon \"surgeries to open blockages\". I believe even though my family has not been dignosed as having this - that they may have something called \"heavy chain diease\" ?? as I have researched about this alot in the past and seems suspect. They all have too high of GOOD colesterol. and high bad colesterol with many of them having irregular congenital (at least from early childhood) irregular heartbeats and Angina with blood pressure issues - some being too low and some being too high.   My episode was approx. 1:30 am three nights ago ...my husband and I were sitting up in bed watching a movie. I had poured myself a small glass of Pear Brandy (actually drank about two full tablespoons) and had eaten dinner about two hours previous no problems... all of a sudden I feel slightly nauseated and it goes away in 5 minutes. I tell my husband - take this \"crap\" and hand him the brandy as I am not \"a drinker\" and consume alcohol about once a month or less.   After Nausea wore off I started to feel ?? extremely depressed but was not thinking of anything in particular and then started tearing up uncontrollably I started laughing as I was crying because it was so crazy that this was happeneing (as I talk about it with my husband - asking what the hell is wrong with me?). Then my heart started racing out of contol and I felt very disconnected and dizzy and could not \"catch my breath\". (I looked up on the internet later about heart symptoms and can relate now the feeling to that \"impending doom\" feeling - there is no better way to describe that particular feeling).   I sat there for about 5 more minutes and then started to notice my chest (equally both sides and down the front and backside of my arms and shoulders start to ache and had medium \"pressure\" feeling. (heart still racing intermittantly)I would say the pain of that was about a 3 or 4 - pretty mild to medium discomfort. I also had kind of referred pain to the back of my left side of neck and jawline - again pretty mild but noticibly something not right. I then decided to get up and head to the bathroom, felt hot and noticed after walking from my side of the bed (15 feet away) to the bedroom door I was completely exhausted and out of breath as if I had sprinted a entire block - I could not get a deep enough breath in and getting breath out seems labored as well. I look at my husband and started to panic because I could not breath and I said I think I need to go to the hospital.   He says raise your arms above your head and take a deep breath... (don't know what his reaosning was for this ?) but I did it and it instantly caused me to start Coughing (not helping breathing) and started my heart racing like wildfire again. I had to sit down to regain my breath.   I then felt the heartbeats really race hard and fast this time and so I laid flat on my back for about 10 to 15 mijutes to regain my breath. I felt just like when you are recooperating from a surgery and have been sent home - you think you can get up and move afterward and then all of a sudden your blood pressure drops and you almost faint... it was very similar to this feeling but with serious heart racing - so fast that it took my breath away.   I tried to get up and walk again and I felt very exhausted, still had some racing of the beats and the chest pressure/pain was very slowly starting to subside. I decided to stay sitting up in bed or laying flat for the next two hours and then seemed ok. I only noticed that my heart was racing if I tried to walk any amount of distance and my chest area and tops of shoulders were \"sore\" to the touch.   I literally talked myself out of going to the emergency room due to having had \"Palpitations\" due to stressful situations in the past 20 years on 5 or 6 occasions (severe stressors not every day stuff) however - I have always been able to control those by immediatley doing deep breathing tecniques and they always stop. ALso - palpitations have NEVER felt like this. Palpitations feel to me like a small quarter size \"flutter\" that moves up my middle sternum and into my throat.   I thought the alcohol could have caused the problem, yet I only drank TWO tablespoons full. Not exactly alcohol intake ??   The next afternoon (I slept in) I felt extremlly tired, exhausted and noticed that if I exerted myself too much I would start mild racing and the chest pressure would come back.   I finally had enough of this and went into the doctors office. Blood work normal / chest xrays normal but the ECG was Borderline Low Voltage on Frontal leads (?) with a question mark next to it. and \"Poor R-wave progression\" Cardiology was called and I had to drive to another hospital to take a troponin I blood test and second blood panel to make sure the levels hadn't changed including D-Dimer. Everything was normal except the ECG. The doctor before I was sent to the other hospital gave me two baby asprin and apple juice \"just in case\" before I was told to drive over there.   I was sent home and still experiencing some very mild chest discomfort (to the touch and really mild pressure) I can almost ignore it .. it is so mild... my blood pressure when I arrived was 97 / 90 and pulse was ? per minute. BP was taken again 45 minutes later and it had gone up to 100 / 65 and bpm was at 80.   In addition to the bL reading and the Poor R-wave Progression these were the findings that I can read and translate for you ...   Rate 55 Normal Heart rythm  Normal P Axis  PR 128  QRSD 74  QT 377  QTc 369   Axis:  P 59  QRS 83  T 43   Poor R-wave Progression shows ...  1 R < .15 or 2 R's < .2 (<----(the rest of this number is cut off by paper ending)   I can clearly see in the aVF area on the ECG that a rather dark line (blip) that looks short but erratic up and down. And Also on the aVR as well but not so erratic. I can't read these ECG's or know what they mean but it appears I have a normal rythm on the bottom \"baseline string\" at the bottom of page but the rest is quite irregular and faint in certain area's with changes in the extra bumps after the initial strikes for each beat in those areas of aVF and aVR.   NOW....   I know that this could be nothing more than a case of bad indigestion - I am not totally paniced however when I got home I had a jarred memory from the experienc ethat warrants some more investigation I beleive and that is that several yaers ago (in the mid 80's approx. 21 years old) I went through a battery of tests for a then current illness and I had remebered being asked if I had ever been diagnosed with a \"heart murmur\" or \"Irregular Heartbeat\" in the past. I said ??? no Idea... never followed up on it and it was never discussed again.   I feel I need to go do a full stress test due to my family history but when I requested this of my doctor - whom was not the doctor who was present the other night and has not seen the ECG (only the other doctors notes) stated he did not think that MY HISTORY warranted getting a stress test and that I did not have significant risk factors.   I feel that if for no other reason I should have one done to check this possibilty of the congenital irregular beats that run in my family and to just get the question of this off my \"chest\" so to speak.  Please help me with this - the first doctor I saw seemed very concerned (I am also a light smoker) (yes I will be quitting on New years day) and so I am slightly confused as to the different opinions I have been told.   Thanks for listening to this extremely long story of my experience....  I appreciate it a lot.   Holly\n\n",

    "content": "You've been very thorough in collecting and sharing your clinical findings! That's a big help, as is your very thorough description of the problem, as well as your family history.   Now then: there are several different facets to what you have presented here. First, you do have a very positive family history for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and possibly Heavy Chain Disease as well. Oddly, your own blood work reveals a very healthy young woman with only a slightly elevated LDL level, with all other cholesterol components looking very good. That's something you might want to work on, but could also be a fluke, so should be repeated. Other than that, nothing much looks wrong on paper. While your EKG is not \"normal\" (low voltage in the frontal leads is very common in women, and \"poor R-wave progression\" is a very non-specific finding, especially in light of everything else being fine). I think you can feel pretty good about that.   Now then, the episode you described is quite striking for a number of reasons. First, it starts out sounding like a fairly typical panic attack, which, in the properly predisposed subject, could be set off by any number of things including a small amount brandy, as that stuff is potent and is great at causing vasodilation and flushing, as well as some of the symptoms you described. Since you are an infrequent drinker, the effect could have been amplified. So there's one part; however, the incident progressed to more concrete symptoms which would seem to follow the textbook description of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). With your major family history and the episode as you describe it, you were certainly wise to get yourself checked out. Women frequently tend to have atypical ACS symptoms however, and yours were quite textbook - up to a point. Where they veered off, and this is an important issue, is in that you describe point tenderness in your \"chest area and tops of shoulders.\" This would suggest something other than a heart-related problem, as point tenderness and pain on body movement is usually related to some musculoskeletal issue and almost never to the heart.  While I find a lot of things in your very complete report to point away from the heart and more toward something emotional or even GI or orthopedically-related, the fact that your symptoms at the height of the episode, your family history, and the fact that women in the United States often still do tend to be dismissed by doctors as over-reactors, all warrant a further investigation into what happened. A family history like yours is one of the highest-priority risk factors (as you obviously are aware). While your acute episode does sound like a mixture of possible cardiac symptoms and anxiety-related ones, you quite rightly pointed to the \"sense of impending doom\" which many ACS sufferers experience. Then again, this also occurs in every panic attack. This clouds the picture, because as with most potential heart problems, the patient usually will feel a good deal of anxiety until and unless he or she can be reassured that the heart is fine, and that is a totally reasonable kind of anxiety, even if it does only serve to muddy the clinical picture. (Anxiety can cause so many cardiac-type symptoms that a majority of people seen in US ERs wind up having had acute anxiety or a panic attack rather than an actual coronary event, but almost all will have had some anxiety regardless).   Based on the description of your espisode, and setting aside the number of mitigating factors (such as point tenderness and some vague symptoms mixed in with the more concrete ones) and your very positive family history, I would suggest you insist on a full workup including nuclear scan stress test and echocardiogram, in order to allow you to put your mind at ease. Were it not for the family history I would probably be more inclined to lean toward an emotional basis for this, but because of that history there is no way I would ignore that potential risk, regardless of all the things I've been able to scratch off the list here. It would seem almost a common sense move to want to evaluate you despite your youth and the fact that anyone with such a positive family history would have to have some possibly hidden concerns about heart disease (and rightly so).   My hunch is that your heart is fine. Medical decisions ought not be based on hunches, however. For your own peace of mind and out of deference to common sense and the symptoms at the center of your primary episode, I would, were I you, pressure my doctor to refer for a comprehensive cardiac workup with nuclear scan stress test and echo. Everything else seems to have been done, but your peace of mind is certainly worth that much extra effort.  Good luck to you. I'm betting you're fine, but no one with a family history like yours should take a pass on being as sure as you can be.\n\n",

    "title": "THANK YOU !!!! And you are correct ......",
    "content": "I do have history which doesn't help diagnosing the episode which are (over-production of acid with GI symptoms chronic) and also have had TMJ surgery in the 80s with arthritis and two severe whiplash injuries which give me chronic musculo-skeletal (spl?) issues on most days. (Correct !!!)  The first doctor I saw the next day, and I , spoke about all these factors including the knowledge i had about the past palpitations.   I am also going through some very heated litigation in my life right now that is very emotional yet I do pretty good with relaxation excersizes and tend to be pretty rational about most all things in life so that I do not delude myself into an emotional state that would cause even more stress than I would be able to handle.  Thank you for your response ~ It has made my suspicsions more concrete and I no longer feel that I am over-reacting about pushing for more thourough tests.  It is quite a coincidence that over the last weekend I had a family reunion which we have every year on that side of the family... I in talking with the cousin (who's mother died at \"24 years old - not 27 as previously thought) informed me of his two children whom are 21 years old (male - in top shape) and his 24 year old daughter whom have BOTH just in December been diagnosed with inherited problems. The son is now on meds for tachardia and irregular beats (spl?) and the daughter needs a pace maker \"installed\" as he put it.  i think due to your response and also the family history I will check into any programs I can find, to seek research into my faimily's problems and see if anyone might like to get involved in a Heavy Chain Disease Study program or something... if nothing else - to prepare our kids and ancestors for the health issues they obviously are going to face in their lives.  Thank you again - i feel much better, unfortunately I am still having the pressure and slight pain - so I am NOW going to call my doctor and have a chat about getting those tests.  Holly\n\n",

Last Sunday i started feeling a stronger heartbeat in my chest; and when i heard it with a stethoscope i could hear my heartbeat stop for a fraction of a second and then start up again.   My Perinatologist in San Diego sent me to the ER where they diagnosed me with Premature Atrial Complexes and took Xrays and did an EKG.   They really didn't tell me anything except to see my OB within a few days.  I won't be able to see my OB until next Thursday and i still feel the palpitations.  I feel like my heart could stop at any moment and i'd leave my 2 year old son motherless.   I stopped drinking coffee last Sunday, do not smoke, do not drink alcohol, avoid other sources of caffeine, and i'm not on any other medication other than prenatal vitamins and an extra 800mcg of folic acid. No past surgeries, no past problems, no family history.  Could you please tell me if you think this is serious or possibly related to my twin girls? Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "What you have described is a very common phenomenon in most people, and especially during pregnancy. The \"skipped\" beats, Premature Atrial Contractions (PACs) are the most benign of all irregular heartbeats, and one of the most common, alongside Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs). Almost everyone has some of these from time to time, and they can feel strange enough to be quite alarming, but they are almost never a true medical concern. In pregnancy, especially, they can become more frequent, because the growing fetus is taking up a lot of room in your abdomen and can cause other internal structures to crowd the heart. This is a lot like what happens after eating a large meal. Between the fact that the heart \"doesn't like to be touched\" and, in the case of pregnancy, there being higher levels of some hormones which can also make the heart's muscle irritable, one is quite likely to have some episodes of palpitations such as you have described. In an otherwise healthy heart these have virtually no significance. The are also not diagnostic of a heart problem in themselves, so doctors do often tend to treat them cavalierly, forgetting the emotionas they can stir up, especially anxiety over the heart's behavior, and during pregnancy those emotions are often amplified anyway.   The bottom line is your doctor is correct in his analysis, but what I hear most frequently is that the doctor didn't take the time to explain what these sensations are, why they happen, and why they are normal.   You sound like a very healthy young woman who will no doubt give birth to a very healthy baby in time. Stopping caffeine is always worth a try when these \"skipped\" (actually premature or early) beats become bothersome or anxiety-producing. Sometimes it helps, as caffeine is a stimulant and all stimulants can, in some people, help trigger these beats.   Otherwise you sound absolutely fine. Try to enjoy this time and congratulations on your upcoming blessed event!\n\n",

I am not \"on\" any medications other than vitamins, although the last few days I began taking low dose Bayer aspirin just as a precaution; my weight is normal (I am 5'1', 113 lbs) I used to be a heavy smoker (over 30 years 2 packs a day) but I quit smoking over 3 years ago. Although my lifestyle is pretty sedentary, I have always considered myself to be in fortunate, good health.  Lately, the last couple of weeks, I have begun having terrible aching in my left shoulder and upper arm, the left side of my neck, all the way down to my hand and the tips of my fingers.  My hand feels almost swollen with pin pricks of pain.  My neck, under my left jaw, feels numb and aches.  The pain in my left arm, etc., begins soon upon waking and lasts pretty much throughout the day.  Occasionally, my head aches. Recently, I just plain don't feel well.   My husband says I am just under a lot of stress from work and other issues, but I am concerned I may be getting ready to have a heart attack or a stroke.  Do my symptoms merit going to the doctor?  If so, which type?  A general practioner or a cardiologist?  Thanks for taking the time to read this and hopefully answer.\n\n",

It is possible that your symptoms are simply due to stress, but these are also the symptoms of heart pain.    An EKG is a good starting place.  Your doctor may also want to do a stress test.  Your primary care doctor can help you get the proper tests and refer you to a cardiologist if needed.  Hope this helps.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi guys   im 18 years old and in good health. Since yesterday ive been having really strange symptoms with my pulse. Basically when I adminster the test myself I get normal readings in between 60-100. However when I used my grandfather's blood pressure monitoring machine I get weird resultrs. First of all I want to admit that I am a hypochondriac and I worry really easily about my health and since yesterday ive been obsessed with my heart. On his machine I get readings above 100...105,103 and around that. However its inconsistent. Ill check once and itll say 120. Ill check 2 minutes later it'll be in the 90s. Check again it'll be in the 80s. Then itll go back over a 100 again. Im a bit freaked out over this. I don't have anyother symptoms...My blood pressure is normal...And I can move\\run around fine...Could it be that my anxiety leads to a rapid heart rate?   Any comments would be greatly appreciated..   Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "I'm presuming the numbers you are giving are your heart rate.  Normal heart rates for your age are 60-100.  Being slightly above this is normal, especially when your anxious.  I suspect that your rapid heart rate is a little \"white coat syndrome\".    It's very common for people to have slightly elevated heart rates and blood pressures at their doctor's office because of a little anxiety.  If your not having any other symptoms and only notice that your pulse is elevated when your checking it, then I would not be too worried about it.  If you notice it is consistently up and does not seem normal to you, you can always discuss it with your doctor and get a full examination.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello i am a 28 year old male, and a i have a question about possible cardiac pain.  here is a brief history of my health.  Back in 2001 i was diagnosed with Diabetes, never really took it seriously so i would say i had about 4-5 years of uncontrolled diabetes.  Well back in september i was doing some reading up on diabetes because i decided it was about time for me to get educated in the matter and change how i was treating it, or not treating if for that matter.    i went to the md back in september for a check up weight was 261..blood pressure was high 155/82.  md started me on lisinopril 10 mg once a day, and back on metforming 500mg one in morning one in evening.  i have since dramatically changed my lifestyle..eating totally different, getting moderate exercise  (20-30min) almost everyday on the exercise bike.  i have brought my blood sugar readings down to usually 120-125 in the am and 105-115 in the evening.  oh i also forgot to mention that when i was diagnosed diabetic i weighed 311lbs...cholesterol back when diagnosed was total 210 LDL 129 HDL 32 triglycerides 244..now when i went this past september they did another lipid test and my cholesterol levels were now total 173 LDL 113 HDL 36 triglyserides 121 my A1C was 8.5...  Well since changing everythign i am now down to 235lbs, and i am due for another lipid test in january pretty excited for that i want to see where i am at..oh any my bp was now down to 127/72 i beleive it was in november check up...  now getting to my question now that you know about my history, every once in a while i will get not really a pain i don't know how to describe it, but a very quick fast throb that last for maybe 2 seconds i would say it is located about 5 inches under my neck and 3 inches from my arm pit on the left side of my chest.. it is very fleeting. sometimes it can be felt into my back...now i also have a little history of heart disease in my family my grandfather passed away of a heartattack at 73 and my uncle at 57..i don't get shortness of breath nor tightness or pressure in my chest.  i was out shoveling the drive inthe cold today and got a little lightheaded..are any of these indications of heart disease or cardiac pain i am feeling in my chest.  i am very paranoid about this now due to the diabetes... please help me...  thanks  Chuck G.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am glad that you have been able to deal with many of your risk factors. By doing so you have significantly reduced the likelihood of getting heart disease in the future hopefully.  The pain you are describing is not characteristic of cardiac pain. Characteristic cardiac pain has the following features:  It is often described as central chest tightness or heaviness which is brought on by exertion and relieved by rest. It may radiate to the arms, the neck, jaw or teeth. Associated symptoms include dyspnea, nausea, sweatiness, faintness.  Precipitating factors Exercise  Emotion  Cold weather  Heavy meals   Pain that is unlikely to be of cardiac origin is typically well localized, sharp, pricky, lancinating type sometimes lasting less than 15 seconds. It can be aching type too but mostly will be aggravated on deep inspiration and coughing. Patient will be able to localize it with the tip of her finger.  Pain that is localized just below left nipple is almost NEVER of cardiac origin.  Please understand that given the limitations of the internet I cannot properly assess or exclude the presence of any serious heart condition. Call your doctor and report your symptoms to him.

    "content": "First the reassuring thing-pain that is worse with a deep breath is not related to the heart, so this is not heart attack pain.  The pain you describe is consistent with a few different things.  First, pleurisy can cause such pain.  The pleura are the linings of the lungs, heart, inside chest wall, etc.  Occasionally an area may get inflamed producing pain.  It is worse with deep breaths because it causes the inflamed pleura to be moved.  Generally this will heal on its own, although anti-inflammatory medications can be helpful if severe.    A second possibility is a syndrome called Precordial Catch Syndrome.  This can cause sudden, stabbing feeling pain with deep breaths, as if the diaphragm or lung is caught on something.  This also tends to resolve on its own.  Please keep in mind that I am not examining you and making an accurate diagnosis over the internet is nearly impossible.  As such, if the pain is worsening or not getting better you should have a true evaluation.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "A few PVC's are considered normal as long as they don't compromise function.  Generally normal PVC's should lessen with increased heart rate.  When you felt your heart racing, did is suddenly start (as if a light switch had been flipped on) or did it gradually increase in rate.  Also, did it stop abruptly or gradually slow down.  Sudden starts and stops can be associated with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) although a rate of 160 is on th slow side for this type of tachycardia.    One of the most common causes of what you are describing is an anxiety attack. Often this is accompanied by a feeling of dread.  It can be normal to feel your heart beating if it is beating hard.  However, if the symptoms continue, or if they are becoming worrisome to you you should have them evaluated by a physician.\n\n",

You may need to have a holter monitor or an event monitor to catch the episodes.  A simple ECG is a good place to start, though.  Your doctor can look for conditions such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome that can predispose you to SVT with an ECG.  If the ECG is normal then consider the holter or other event monitor.

    "content": "Dear Sir / Madam,  I've been smoking for the past 7 years and I smoke about an average of 10 Cigs per day. The main problem with me is that I also chew and \"Swallow\" the GUTKHA (Beetel Nuts with Tobacco). My GUTKHA consumption is more than my smoking.  Actually I'm a Guitarist and I have to spend a lot of time practicing and studying - thats why I smoke and chew a lot...  Recently (for the past 1 week or so) I feel a vague Chest Discomfort in the night, ie after I have my Dinner. Its a vague feeling of \"Heaviness\" and \"Very Slight Pain\" and I feel like I want to burp a lot and relieve myself of the discomfort.  From the past 2 days this sypmtom occurs even when I have very little or no food. I feel that this feeling is getting amplified because of my pshyscological thinking also - ie I'm constantly worried that I may be suffering from a Heart disease or something very serious.  The Discomfort is both in Lest side and the right side consistently - I cant determine where exactly it is. I'm really afraid to discus this with my Parents as they may become very depressed and worried and hence I'm not able to consult a Doctor too.  My only aim in life is to achieve something in music - to become a great Guitarist and I'm really worried (physically and more phsycologically) that my dreams might be shattered if I have something serious...  Also please note that I sleep very less everyday - I practice for 4 - 5 hours the whole night and I goto bed by 5 - 6 Am in the morning and sleep till 10.30 Am (5 hours approx).  I don't know why this is happening - may be because of lack of sleep or due to my excessive tobacco consumption (smoking and chewing)  Please advice - what should I do - is there something very serious with me ?  Also kindly note that I'm 24 years of age and my height is 5'8 and weight is 85 KGs.  Regards Kush  P.S - I discussed this with an elderly friend who says its all because of Gastric problems.\n\n",

This pain comes spontaneously, sometimes occuring twice a week or five times or more a day, lasting for about a few minutes. It doesn't particularly happen when I'm engaged in strenuous activity. Most of the time I'm plainly sitting down when it occurs. Recently it has been more frequent, sometimes lasting for an hour or more. I have other symptoms that are just as frequent. I often get a sensation that lasts for a few seconds, that feels like my heart is vibrating or fluttering. Also, at times, I feel light-headed when I stand up. All of this has been going on for a little over a year. A month after it started, I went to the doctor. He listened to my heart for only about a  minute and told me I most likely have a sinus arrythmia. But that doesn't explain the symptoms I'm having. Could his diagnosis be wrong?   What could these symptoms mean? What do you recommend I do?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The first step is to assess the presence of risk factors for cardiac disease. The presence of less risk factors makes heart disease less likely. Age (the incidence increases with age and is higher in those above 50).  Males are more prone than females (especially premenopausal women). Males are 5 times more prone to develop the disease at the age of 50.  Serum cholesterol and lipids: A ratio of LDL to HDL of greater than 4:1 increases the risk dramatically. Conversely, a higher HDL level seems to offer protection. Serum cholesterol levels should be kept below 200mg/dL.  Smoking: increases the incidence by 60%.  Hypertension: whether systolic or diastolic tends to increase the risk.  Diabetes mellitus: is known to increase the incidence of IHD both in males and females.  Family history: a familial predisposition is known to exist and is in part due to inheritence of the above risk factors.  Oral contraceptives is associated with an increased incidence of myocardial infarction.  Gout, Type A personality, premature arcus corneae, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia and diagonal ear lobe crease have all been reported to increase the risk of developing ischemic heart disease.  Characteristic cardiac pain has the following features:  It is often described as central chest tightness or heaviness which is brought on by exertion and relieved by rest. It may radiate to the arms, the neck, jaw or teeth. Associated symptoms include dyspnea, nausea, sweatiness, faintness.  Precipitating factors Exercise  Emotion  Cold weather  Heavy meals   Pain that is unlikely to be of cardiac origin is typically well localized, sharp, pricky, lancinating type sometimes lasting less than 15 seconds. It can be aching type too but mostly will be aggravated on deep inspiration and coughing. Patient will be able to localize it with the tip of her finger.  Pain that is localized just below left nipple is almost NEVER of cardiac origin.  Chest pain in young women is commonly associated with conditions such as mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic valve disease (such as mitral stenosis), anxiety and depression, neuromusculoskeletal conditions (the pain is very well localized and tender to the touch), gastrointestinal (esophageal reflux, esophageal spasm and peptic ulcer disease), or lung conditions (pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, pleurisy, pneumothorax).  As you can see chest pain in a young female has lots of reasons. Most of the time they are not of cardiac origin. A thorough clinical examination, appropriate investigations, and reassurance will go a long way in resolving this issue.  Please understand that given the limitations of the internet I cannot exclude the presence of any serious heart condition.  My opinion is for you to seek another opinion if you are still complaining of chest pain. Your palpitations are most likely to be caused by sinus arrhythmia.  Best regards,\n\n",

The pain is usually chronic dull aching or alternatively, acute constant episodes of sharp pain in the right hypochondriac area. It may present as pain in the epigastrium.   Sometimes it is associated with vomiting, fever, local tenderness and rigidity, and your physician may be able to palpate gall bladder mass.  If this is a recurring problem you should have it properly evaluated since this is not possible here given the limitations of the internet.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 29 year old female with several \"problems\".  I am overweight and have been my whole life.  I have PCOS and have had Carpal Tunnel Release surgury on both wrists.  The only other surgury that I have had was to put my right hip back into socket when it was dislocated in a car accident.  My maternal grandmother also has pulpitations, but she is 86 years old and still in fair condition.  When I was younger my heart rate was about 58 beats a minute and now is about 65 beats a minute.  I just recently had my blood pressure taken and it was 120/78.  I smoke 1 pack a day and don't drink anymore.  I never drank too heavily and have had my liver tested and it is ok.  I have also had my thyroid tested and it is ok.  First of all I have had a heart murmur since birth (I think) and had an ultrasound like test done when I was about 16 or 17.  I don't remember what they said about it except that I have a misshapped left ventricle or something like that.  Lately I have had a few problems.    I notice that my heart pulpitates alot and that my legs have been getting numb if I sit for a while and when I bend over like to clean my cat's litter box I get a weird sensation in my legs almost like the lower half of my body is getting cut in half.  It really hurts.  Not every time but quite a bit if it is for more than a few seconds.  I also get the same sensation when I reach up too high, such as putting a nail in the wall above my head and I reach up as far as I can.  Not sure if that has anything to do with my heart or not but it has been bothering me more lately.  I also notice red vein like spots on my ankles.  Also today I was coughing quite bad and i got the weirdest sensation on the surface of my chest just below my neck and on the outside edges of my hips/buttocks.  It felt like an electrical shock and then the 2 areas began to itch.  This has happened quite a few times but only on my upper chest.     I also have noticed when my feet get cold they start to itch severely and even when I warm them up they feel itchy for a good 30 minutes.    I also have been getting charlie horses in my calfs at night.  I have gotten about 5 in the last month with no exercising or anything the previous days or anything.    I have trouble sleeping at night.  It is not that I am not tired because if I lay down I go right to sleep, it is more that I don't want to waste any \"free\" time sleeping.    I don't know if any of this has anything to do with my heart but I had a physical last week and the doctor said that I should see a cardioligist when I get insurance just to see if anything is wrong.  This has got me thinking about all of the problems that I have and that I feel like there is something wrong with me but I don't know what.  I feel like I am being a hypochondriac but don't know.  I recently lost my job just before I was going to have insurance and now I want to get checked out but don't want to pay the price if I am being a hypochondriac.\n\n",

    "content": "HI GT1924:  You have a lot of misc things going on.   I'm sure you have heard what I am going to tell you before.  First, if you saw your GP, obviously he/she didn't think there was any serious heart condition.  Heart conditions don't wait until you get insurance.  If you have one, you deal with it NOW, not 6 months from now.  My advice would be to quit smoking,  try to get some gentle (such as walking) exercise.   Some information you left out which would be helpful is how much you weigh, and do your ankles swell?  If so, when?  Do they ever not swell?  Do you have varicose veins or is this red thing on your ankle something new?   Obviously you've seen your Dr and he/she doesnt think you have any emergency situations, but its very difficult to discuss so many issues without a lot of information and or seeing you.  Having your blood pressure taken once is useless, take it over a week, and keep a log, same with pulse.  Are you on any medications?  As you can see, this isn't a question with a simple answer.  I really think you should make a list of all the issues that concern you and have a very candid discussion with your doctor insurance or not, so that your mind can be put at ease.\n\n",

I have posted here before but I am not getting good replies-just \"see your doctor\".  I have no doctor, no insurance and no money.  I have had panic attacks in the past, been to the ER for them more than once.  I had one so bad that i couldnt speak and thought I was having a stroke.  I had a complete workup on my heart about 2 years ago (echo, dye, stres, 24 hr holter, EKG).  Doc said I was fine except for some minor PVC's that should be ignored.  A year or so before that I had a complete \"central nervous system\" workup that included MRI, audiovisual testing, etc.  All these were normal.  Lately I have had my hands and feet falling asleep.  My eyes hurt.  My ears roar with tinnitus.  My heart beats very fast ( I took a pulse of 180 bpm after a shower last week).  I feel short of breath.  I yawn and sigh a lot.  I burp a lot.  I feel depersonalized and extremely scared.  My left chest, shoulder and elbow hurt.  I get \"zaps\" of pain in my hands and feet.  I want to exercise to lose weight but I am afraid.  I do walk daily and I don't feel any worse when I do but not really better either.  I have had an increase in floaters in my ocular field lately and my vision seems to flicker sometimes.  Does all this sound like panic disorder or maybe hyperventilation syndrome?  I remember crying with chest pain to my mother when I was 12.  Once, I was in PE class and everyone had to run down and shoot the basketball. I got so afraid I fell down twice while trying to make it to the goal.  So I have a long history of anxiety/panic.  Since Ive had these complete workups, would it be possible for things to go awry with heart or brain in a 2-3 year time frame?  Please advise.. Thanks!\n\n",

The pain are in the upper left side of his chest, almost in the shoulder area.  He has had the usual tests by a cardiologist...EKG's, treadmill test etc.  Doctor's concluded it was anxiety and put him on a muscle relaxer and 2 anti anxiety meds....his  chest pains did not subside.  Since then he has cut down on the anti-anxiety meds and no longer takes the muscle relaxer ( it sapped all his energy).  He complains on constant uncomfortable feelings, lots of back pain and strange \"wave feelings in his chest\"  sometimes at night.  He is currently seeing a chiropractor as he thought the pain may be back related, but it seems to have had little effect.  I am wondering if it may be nerve or muscle related.  If so, what steps can be taken to diagnosed this issue better.  He is miserable and stressed about the possible cause of these symptoms.  In addition I will say that since beginning the meds, he has gained 30 lbs and feels worried to exercise more because of the pains.  Any help would be appreciated very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jinkus, There are a variety of causes of the sensation of \"skipped/gained beats\" both cardiac and noncardiac in origin. If you have had an evaluation by a cardiologist an there is no underlying cardiac anomaly, a noncardiac cause of course should be considered. Increased levels of stress, anxiety, caffiene, certain over the counter medications, electrolyte imbalances, endocrine dysfunction, etc., etc., may cause symptoms. I would suggest an evaluation by your physician, along with some diagnostics, ie., labwork, to rule out any other causative factors. If an etiology for the palpitations can not be found, reducing stress levels, and episodes that trigger anxiety would also be helpful. Congratulations on stopping smoking by the way!

There is no family history of rapid or irregular heart beats and the athlete is on no current medication.  This athlete randomly gets a racing heart with beats over 140bpm and has very high blood pressure (>150/100).  He has been seen by a cardiologist and has been cleared to participate in all sporting events.  The cardiologist has told this athlete that when this occurs all he should do is lay down and wait approximately 5 minutes once it stops before returning to play.  I am just wondering if anyone has seen any cases like this and if so is this a condition that should be closley monitored in fear of something bad happening.

Quit the Afrin, and sore throat seemed to  begin to subside somewhat.  \"Heartburn\" feeling, however, has  continued, and at times is very painful, can feel like a stabbing straight through my chest, and even feel 'bruised' on surface in breastbone area.

My hands have been becoming \"tingly\" almost like they are asleep.  When the pain gets intense I have difficulty catching a good breath.  The other night it woke me from sleep and I went to the ER.  They did an EKG and said that looked good.  No xray, blood work, nothing else.  They said they though it was inflamation in the chest wall.  They also said they could hear what sounds like sandpaper rubbing on the left side of my chest.  They sent me home and told me to apply ice to my chest and take motrin.      They were very busy that night and I just want a second opinion.  My pulse on the monitor stayed around 130 and my blood pressure was 150 over 110.    I have been under a lot of stress lately and thought maybe it was just because of that.  Really not sure what is going on.  Any advice will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

Upon your examination when an unusual sound was heard by the person doing the assessment were you instructed to hold your breath for a few seconds so that the area producing the sound was identified as being specific to lung sounds or heart sounds? If only an EKG was completed, no xray, nor labwork, I would strongly suggest that you have a re-evaluation. These diagnostics should have been (and should be) completed as well.

    "content": "Hi,  Basically late last week (friday to be exact) my heart a couple of times seemed to whince and cause me some discomfort, i thought little of it and my friends said it happens at times and I proceded to have a large weekend of party that had been planned months in advance. On Sunday I woke up and my chest was very tight and heavy. I laid low and hoped it would go away and although it got no worse it didnt really get any better. On monday it wasnt as bad in the morning but it came back later in the day and i was very aware of a slight throbbing on both sides of my chest and even experienced slight little pains on both sides of my arms.  Again I tried to lay low and on tuesday I woke up again and there was no pain but as the day went on it returned and so did the slight pains. So i booked an appointment with the nurse and went in and told her about the tight chest and she didnt seem too worried but said I should go to the doctor if i felt worried to put my  mind at rest.   The pains are back slightly but ive taken an anti heart burn pill to see if that solves the problem.  Im basically wondering what is potentially wrong with me or if it could just be a case that ive been going out too much recently and my body is knackered and needs a break...  Could you tell me what the possible things are, what the best advice for me is. Also what would be the effects on my condition (if i even really have one) if I drank alcohol?  If it helps I have smoked for a few years but have cut down to 1-5 a day for the last 6 months or so, I havent smoked since saturday due to my chest condition.  Thanks alot in advance. :)\n\n",

Small family cardiac history.  5 weeks ago after 19 hours in an airplane, next day I started having shortness of breath mostly in the 2nd half of the day, regardless of doing exercise of not. After a few days I started feeling mild chest pain (3/10), sometimes behind the breastbone, sometimes a little to the left, wasn't going away in 15-30 min., it stayed sometimes for hours, most of the time accompanied with shortness of breath. It doesn\u2019t correlate with exercise or meals.  Went to a cardiologist, still and stress EKG/BP/echo looked OK, still and stress EKG/BP/echo OK (except 'borderline functional capacity' !?), didn't feel any pain/shortness of breath while running on the treadmill. Blood tests OK (including D-Dimer <200). CXR OK. He said it's probably GERD, gave me few pills for GERD, took those for 2 weeks, started also taking 81mg aspirin and Xanax on my own, no good.  I can't properly fall asleep laid on my back, feel like suffocating sometimes, pinches/aches in my left arm/shoulder, sometimes palpitations/heat waves sometimes, cold sweats, chest pain is still diffuse and lasts for hours, 2nd half of the day. During the morning usually only a light shortness of breath is present.  Went again to the cardiologist few days ago, did only still EKG, looked OK, BP OK as well, no clues.  I also read that angina usually doesn't last for hours. The pain still lasts for hours, same for shortness of breath.  Pericarditis? Pleurisy? Aorta/tri-valve obstruction? What tests should I ask for?\n\n",

I have seen my family doctor, endocrine doctor, have had head MRI, chest CT, cardiac stress test, and numerous lab tests.  I keep feeling worse and no one has found an answer to what is going on.  My hx is this, 4 years ago I was dx with essential tremors, (although I tremor at rest and with activity) and am on no medication for this as any I tried never helped with the tremors, but only made me sleepy.  The tremors came on suddenly 2 months after being struck in the face, and suffered a blow to my rt shoulder and left upper chest from a pt where I worked.  2 years ago I began feeling very fatigued, this started in the winter time.  When summer came anytime I went outside to do anything I would start sweating profusly, my face became extremely red and I felt as if all my strenght was drained from me.  This occurred all summer, then when the weather became cooler I noticed the sweating decreased, but the fatigue remained.  Lab work done showed I was postmentalpausal.  I only have 1 ovary and would monitor my levels and 1 1/2 years earlier I was normal.  So of course everone said I was having  hot flashes.  Except they only came on with activity.  The follow spring a cardiac stress test was done and I was told it was normal, a chest CT showed nodulas in my right lung (has been repearted with no change) and a slight increase in size in accending aorta, told it was ok.  Head MRI was normal except it said something about some markings that could suggest MS.  This last summer sx returned with the sweating and fatigue, sever enough I went outside very little.  A year ago I developed a pain in my upper chest on the lt side.  AT times it is a deep pain that will go into my back at times or a burning feeling.  My lt arm will also hurt with numbness in my last 2 fingers, swelling, dicoloration at times.  At times after using my arm I will also get numbness on the lt side of my neck and face.  I started watching my b/p last year and noticed anytime I started feeling bad, brought on with miminal physical activity, that my b/p would be elevated.  As high as 180/110, then return to my normal of 110/70 with in an hour or so.  Prior to doing anything my b/p was also in the range.  I get palpations and feel wweak.  It has been noted on my last dr vist that my b/p in my rt arm was 126/78, but in my lt. it was 80/p.  Also any time a b/p or lab is done in my lt arm it causes my marm to hurt, not alittle, but like someone is cutting my arm off.  This was done by the endo dr. who has refered me to a cardiologist, who I have not seen yet.  I am very concerned with what is going on with me, I am not able to do much of anything without becoming ill.  2 years ago I dug a 100 ft, 2 ft deep drainage ditch by hand, and back filled it with gravel, now I can't dig a hole to plant a tree.  Am I headed in the right direction with the caridologist?  Thanks for any information.  Deby\n\n",

When I lay on my stomach it is somewhere in the middle of the two. I have no idea what's going on and neither do any of the nurses I've seen.

    "content": "I am a 48 year old female. Beginning last March I began to feel my heart racing on occasion and had difficulty talking and breathing at the same time during these episodes. A couple of months later it seemed to have worsened because out of the blue my heart would start pounding so fast and so hard it felt like it would jump right out of my chest. And I would experience pain in the center of my chest near my heart. These intense pounding sensations started at first only occasionally but soon they became more frequent and would start for no reason through out the day. I would estimate that my heart was beating at well over 200 beats per minute (kind of like a jack hammer) for roughly 15- 30 seconds each time I had an episode and it was so hard that I could feel it all the way up my throat and into my ears. This really scared me!   I went to the doctor because I also suspected that in addition to my heart problem I was diabetic because of my family history  and my symptoms of night sweats and extreme fatigue, and wanted to be tested. The tests showed that I am indeed diabetic and the dctor put me on Metaglip 25/500mgs. After trying several BP meds that caused severe physical reactions, my doctor put me on Verelan PM 300 mgs. I also take 25mgs of Hydrochlorothyzide for the edema in my feet and ankles caused by the Verelan. This has stopped the intense pounding, but I still feel my heart beating fast on occasion.    I was born with a heart murmur I was told was harmless and had lazy eye and I am blind in my left eye. I was diagnosed with Optic Nerve Atrophy in both eyes, with the optic nerve in the left eye being so shrivled it is the cause of the blindness from birth. The right side is not as severe.  I recently went to a new physician. During my visit I asked her if I should have had any kind of testing done on my heart. When she discovered that I had never had any tests she immediately did and EKG in her office. My heart beat was 101 even with the medication I have been taking, so the doctor sent me for an Echocardiogram.   I just had the Echo done and won't get the results until next week, but I am curious about a couple of things.   The technician seemed to spend a long time focusing on the lower left side of my heart and I wonder what that might indicate?   How high is too high for my heart to beat, especially since I'm already taking medication that is supposed to control this?  I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia about 3-4 years ago, but now wonder if this fatigue could have been the diabetes. And could these heart symptoms I have be contributing to this fatigue because I still have days where I  am extremely exhausted?  Thank you for looking at my post.\n\n",

A heart rate of 101 beats per minute at rest would most likely indicate that it is not well controlled with the current medication regimen. I hope you have had a follow up, etc. with your physician.

    "title": "Re: Intense heart pounding tachycardia",
    "content": "Dear AngelHeart,  100 beats per minute is the cutoff for tachycardia.  Your blood pressure medication can cause slowing of the heart rate. This does not necessarily mean that your heart rate is actually high and your blood medication is making it slower than it should.  The feeling of fatigue can actually be caused by your blood pressure medication as a direct side effect or if your blood pressure gets really low especially that you are taking hydrocholorothiazide at the same time which is a diuretic and can cause dehydration and dehydration can lead to fatigue. Fibromyalgia is a known cause of fatigue as well.  From the description of your tachycardia episodes, you might need to be evaluated by a cardiologist.  In addition to heart causes, tachycardia may be caused by thyroid disease and disturbance in the blood electrolytes. Blood electrolytes disturbance can be caused by hydrocholorothiazide as well.  If you never had your blood tested, i would suggest that you have a thyroid function test and blood chemistry test.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and I hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

Although  one typical symptom is heartburn, some descriptions can also be described as a pressure or pain in the chest, chest pain or discomfort after meals or when lying down, asthma symptoms, coughing, wheezing, etc. Keep in mind that I am not implying that this is the underlying problem but it is something for consideration.

Again, an EKG was done which also showed a heart attack.  I was then given an echocardiogram which was normal and did not show any damage.  Cardiologist said I was fine.  I continue to have the pain.  It seems to be in sync with an ache in my back exactly opposite of the pain in my chest.  I've also had fluttering in my chest with a weird feeling coming over me.

Because Echo shows state of the valves, chambers, pumping power etc. Only if some damage has resulted from lack of blood supply, it will show.  Whereas stress test or stress thallium will show lack of blood supply to the heart even before any damage is done. In this sense it can \"predict\" future heart attacks or anginal pains.  Your clinical description though does not fit into the cardiac type of pain though. You have not stated your age, habits, (smoking etc).   But always, to evaluate a case of chest pain Echo and a stress EKG/thallium done in tandem are more informative and accurate.   Dr Apurva Madia\n\n",

    "content": "Dear jasoneggleston  You have mentioned that you do have frequent heartburns.   In fact, chest pain can be interpretted in too many different ways.    However in your case, since you have said that it could be due to your acid reflux problem, have you tried taking your anti acid medicine. If your chest pain goes away, then this will indicate that your chest pain was due to your acid problem.  thank you very much, and best wishes that you feel better soon.\n\n",

    "content": "ok, for starters:  20 years old; male 6'3, 155 lbs. (thin) no previous health history no family history no allergies or med's.. no surgeries or diagnosis smoked for 3 years; pack every 2 days, quit 2 months ago  ok.. in january, i had a bad cold, coughing all the time mainly and stuffy nose.. mom used to wake me up and give me water because i would cough in my sleep and not know it.. anyways, i kind of left it \"untreated\" until about 4 or 5 days before it passed.. or so i thought it passed..  about 2 days after it passed, i started experiencing chest pains everytime i took a deep breath.. then, about 2 days after this, i was talking to my girlfriend on the phone while driving, and as i was just about to pull onto my street, i had to hang up the phone on her, and it was like i had a panic attack or SOMETHING, of some sort, it came out of NOWHERE..   i could barely move because it would be very uncomfortable and would hurt if i moved too much, i was lightheaded, short of breath, pale, and my heart rate was through the roof.. avg. 125 beats per minute while resting..  i called 911 because i have never experienced anything like that before and it scared me, no idea what it could have been.. but when i got to the hospital, it started to subside, and my chest pain started to die down as well as my heart rate and so on... but from that day forward ive been having minor chest pain here and there throughout the day, everyday; i went to emerg once and had an x-ray done because it was mainly pain on my right side, and x-rays were negative, they said it is probably a strained muscle from coughing so much.. ok, thats fine.... and its not that my heart beats fast, because it doesnt, usually about 70 beats a minute.. but i can almost CONSTANTLY feel my heart beating, even in my wrist and sometimes my neck when doing streneous work.. and i can see my chest move as well as my shirt, almost everytime it look for it, and i am CONSTANTLY thinking about my heart beating hard.. i sometimes have to toss and turn to get a comfortable position in bed, where i can barely feel my heart beat so i can fall asleep.. i have also had trouble in recent weeks making a complete and full bowel movement.. although i have been VERY gassy, and it does help relieve some chest/abdominal pain..  i have been to my family doctor.. she thinks it is withdrawl symptoms from quitting smoking and anxiety/stress.. she listend to my heart and said it sounds \"great\".. no murmurs, no skipped or extra beats, nothing.. and it may very well be.. but it is constant, everyday and is getting VERY annoying..   i finally got up yesterday, and went to the emergency with my girlfriend, waited for 5 hours, finally got in to see the doctor.. i explained everything to her, she hooked me up to an EKG, a heart monitor AND took my blood work... waited for an hour.. my girlfriend and I watched my BPM the entire time.. varied between 56 and 75 and my blood pressure is around 125/75 or something like that, which i am told is good.. when the results all came back, nothing wrong! everything looked great.. all my cardiac was good, the EKG and the blood work turned up fine.. he said he believes it is withdrawl from smoking as well... but im not buying it at all! these are not usual symptoms for quitting cold turkey are they???   so my MAIN concerns are, what is causing my \"awareness\" or my heart beats, mainly when sitting or laying down or stand still, my occassionaly chest pain, varies between right and left side, only lasts for a second or 2.. and my bowel movement problem?? is it just anxiety/stress and withdrawl symptoms? please i need an experts advice! thanks so much!

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 20 year old male. I've posted in this forum before about heart flutters and palpitations and I read your post and can relate in some ways to what you're going through.  The similarities between us are quite the same! I posted on here just over a year ago and I still think about my heart beats, possibily because I let stress get the better of me which isnt always a good thing! The typical factor to rid yourself of this is trying to get your mind off it. I find engrossing yourself in something you find interesting will releave a large part of it. If not all of it! Overtime you may see the sense that you shouldn't have actually been worrying about it at all, and that life is too short to think about it! (As with many of peoples panics). It has worked for me, but my lifestyle just has just not yet accomodated it full time.  Just briefly to explain my situation, and I'm here to help, but I've recently become more concerned about my heart and am likely going to do the EKG similar to you (Just on the safe side). I have had this on and off for about 3 years now, with palpitations and slight to noticable flutters over the period. Palpitations are a rapid increase in heart rate. They cause the heart to beat strongly in your chest and in most cases don't last long before the hearts natural pace returns to normal. In my case, right away. These can be due to drug stimulants such as coffee, stress and the like. My palpitations in particular were due to extreme stress that I exerted on my body, possibly 100% mentally, provoking anxiety which then lead to the extreme levels of stress which affected my heart. I feel now that I am doing it once again. Recently however I have felt more prolonged irregular beats, upto 5 seconds. So yes, in my case I need to just relax a lot and I have also been told that it is connected with stress. My one concern is that I don't want to end up doing anything damaging to my heart in the long term!  If you'd like to find out more about the situation I suffered above you might find my post/replies quite useful in revealing a few answers. http://www.doctorslounge.com/cardiology ... -3153.html  Try to ignore the bit at the end! That was a concern I had, that I believe was quite irrational!  However, I am trying to focus on you. Judging from what you have said I would most likely say that you suffered a palpitation. This is what happened to you in the car when on the phone to your girlfriend. You could have felt a sudden gripping or contraction that lead to the fast onset of beats? Or perhaps it just came on, I don't know as I am not you! :) The good thing I have been told, is that these are nothing to worry about. Obviously if they kept happening it is probably based on your current lifestyle or outlook on what is possibily stressing you? I don't know, you didnt say if you were stressed! However, you said you think about your heart beat all the time? Well, it is likely, just as I do, you're anxious and dwelling on these which is causing you to notice it WAY more than normal. Being in your 20s, its a stress!! I know!! I am 20!! A lot of it is made up in your mind. That doesnt mean you need any psychological help, it just means that you are frightened of the unknown, as I can be a lot of the time, and therefore force yourself to become paranoid.   As I am sure the doctor will say, I doubt very much in this young stage of your life that smoking had any lasting affect on your heart. I am no professional, merely someone who has experienced the same as you. I really would like to hear more from you about how you're getting on because sometimes finding common ground with people can help a lot in talking the problem you face over.  P.S - I don't think that smoking has or had any effect on you. Anxiety in my view can be a more powerful drug than any stimulant if it is pushed that way. I'd really like to know if you suffered from any stress prior to your querry:)  I hope I can be of some use!  RichardC\n\n",

    "title": "Chest pain for 5 months",
    "content": "I'm a 25 year old male from Miami, FL. I've been pretty healthy all my life.  Only surgery was to remove a nose polyp in 2005.  I've always had gas problems, and have had some tests done in the past including a sigmoidoscopy in 2000, all negative.  Well, starting in October of 2005 I began having pains in the left side of my chest.  It would come and go.  I went and had an EKG and an ultrasound (ECO) done.  While I was waiting for the results I had a panic attack and ended up in the ER.  They did some tests and said it was anxiety.  All tests in the ER were good, and the EKG and ECO came back normal as well.  Since then I've had a few more panic attacks, but the anxiety has gotten better with time.  What hasn't gotten better is my health.  I've gotten a few colds, I had strep throat, an infection in my nose where the polyp removed was, pain in my stomach, and the chest pain is still there and has spread to my right chest area as well.  It's around the sternum, and the lower and upper rib area mostly.  I had another ECO done as well as an ultrasound of my liver, spleen, gallbladder, and aorta, and everything is normal.  I had a stool test for bacteria and it was normal.  Blood work, normal.  II even saw a chiropractor cause he said it's probably back related, and after 10 visits, nothing.  The pain comes and goes, but its still there.  I don't know what other tests to do.  Im supposed to have an endoscopy done soon, and I take Omeprazole for acid reflux.  Ive also had pain in my lower stomach, have gone to the bathroom more than usual to urinate, stkill get the stomach pains, and have even developed a pain that also comes and goes in the area between my testicles, and rectum.  Could this really be all b/c of anxiety, or is something wrong that they still haven't discovered?  This is all frustrating b/c I've always been healthy, rarely get colds, and this came about one day out of the blue (the chest pain) after I took a Nitric Oxide supplement to work out.  Help me out here please.  Thank you for your time/\n\n",

You might want to go to the cardio forum from http://www.medhelp.com, there are plenty of people that talk to eachother there and you can also ask the doctors questions but you have to be lucky to do that since they only allow 1-2 questions per day.  Do you get shortness of breath or feel like you have something stuck in your neck ? When you say it comes and goes, how long does it last usually, minutes, hours ? Is it better just after meals while you still didn't digest the food and gets worse after a while when you start having gas problems ?  I'm also hoping of having this because of spine or anxiety issues, but still think of the worst.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  I am a 22 year old male.  I live an active life: 2 marathons in last two years (3:34 & 3:19) & gym 3-4 times/week.  My last marathon was in May 2005.  For the past few months, I have been battling severe heartburn and abdominal pain.  Barium swallow test showed \"severe reflux with mild gastritis\".  Had a gastroscopy that was normal.  I also have mild swallowing problems.  Currently taking Pariet 20mg once daily & sometimes Gaviscon on top to relieve heartburn.  I am a tense type of person with lots of stress and feel that my symptoms do get worse during stressful times.    Along with the GI related issues, I am also having chest pain/tightness & back pain.  The chest pain is almost always localized in the left side.  The pain radiates laterally to my rib cage and superiorly to my neck and shoulders.  I also sometimes feel that my left arm is a bit numb.  The chest/back problems are made much worse when I go running.  Also, I develop abdominal cramps and belch alot.  For these reasons,  I have not been able to run for the past couple of months.  However, other exercises such as EFX, stepmill, bike, and stepper do not cause chest pain/tightness despite the fact that I do these exercises at fairly high intensity.  My breathing has not been affected but I do feel a slight chest pain in my left side when I take a very deep breath.  I just had an ECG and am waiting for the results.  I have a family history of atherosclerosis on my grandmother's side (my dad's mom) but my parents are fine.  My cholestrol test from 2003 was normal.    I am beginning to think that it may be esophageal spasms but the chest pain/tightness is at times present 24 hours a day.  Any ideas?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chest pain/tightness",
    "content": "Dear Med2009,  To evaluate the probability that chest pain is related to coronary disease or not, two things are looked at. The first is risk factors for coronary disease that the patient has and the second is the characteristics of the chest pain.  From your history, other than being a male, you don't have any major risk factors for coronary disease (assuming you are a non-smoker because of your history of running marathons and other vigoirous exercise). The characteristics of your chest pain are atypical as compared to the pain of coronary disease. This means that it is highly unlikely that your chest pain is related to coronary disease.  This chest pain could be related to your severe reflux disease, pariet at the current dose and gaviscon every now and then might not be doing the job. You might need to increase the dose and the freqnecy of taking pariet or may be switch to a different medication of the same category.   Other causes of atypical chest pain include: - Mitral valve prolapse, a benign condition that only need to be watched.   - Neck spine problems specially that you are complaining of having problems with neck pain and numbness sometimes. - Esophageal spasms can certainly be the reason behind the chest pain. - Mild inflammation of the ribs and cartilages can be the reason as well. - This does not sound like an inflammation of the membrane surrounding the lung but can certainly be.  So, i recommend that you discuss this with your doctor and if thought to be indicated, to have an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart to look for mitral valve prolapse) and an x-ray or a cat scan of your neck spine (to look for neck spine problems such as arthritis), and may be a chest x-ray to make sure that everything is ok.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and I hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello!  I'm a 27 year old male with worries I might be experiencing signs of Heart Failure but am not very sure....  I had a couple years in my past where I partied a little too hard during college and have since stopped.  I'm still worried that those years might have done something to me as I notice that I am growing a bigger and bigger intolerance to exertion.  I haven't worked or exercised since I was 17 and think it could also be that I'm just out of shape.  How can I tell?  I am not overweight. exact opposite actually, and i get winded just walking up the stairs to my apartment.  I tried to get on a walking machine at my apt gym the other day and i nearly fainted after a 30 min brisk walk.  Often times I feel my heart beating hard at rest and tons of other things with my heart that I never noticed before.  I stopped smoking and drink lightly.  Even just walking up hill gets be breathing very hard.  Am I out of shape or might I have a heart condition.  I don't notice anything else like edema or difficulty breathing when lying down or coughs or anything.  just the extreme difficulty just doing regular exercise.  Should I see a cardiologist and take a stress test?  I know I kind of rambled on but I got tons of things on my mind..  any advice would be very appreciated!    Thanks a ton!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 36 year old white male with no past history of heart problems with a family history of heart disease, taking no medication, maybe 15 pounds overweight, have found out in the last 6 months my blood pressure is just over normal, 140's over 90's.  I am trying to determine if I should seek medical care as I am a bit hesitant since I have been laid off and lost medical benefits.   A few days ago I began to feel a flutter in the center to slight left of where my ribs meet.  The flutter episodes were sometimes spontaneous, to me anyway at other times the flutters appeared to be precipitated by bending over, squatting or standing up from a seated position.  The flutter would last only 10 or 20 seconds then stop.  I took my pulse immediately after a few of the flutters however it was in the 70's.  Heartburn often followed the flutters.  After the first day of this when I woke up the next day my left hand asleep right hand was fine and left arm near shoulder had slight pain, I was not sleeping on the left hand but on my back.  The left hand symptom went away immediately upon waking.  I have not had any of the classic signs of heart attack i.e. pressure, pain however this has never happened to me before.  The flutters only lasted for two days and now appear to be dissipating.  All of the above has been accompianed by slight pain in my entire left hand and when the entire issue seems to flairing I have slight pain in my left foot and buttock which the left foot and buttock isssues have been present for several years w/o any of the other symptoms.  Any advice or a starting point for me would be great.\n\n",

This is nothing but a fibrillating motion of muscle fibres of your chest muscles. This is benign and the best course is to neglect the same.   The sleeping of the left arm mostly could be due to a cervical spondylosis, which compresses the nerve bundle passing out to your arm. This can be confirmed by an x ray of the neck. However some shoulder exercises and hot fomentation over the neck area will help.  Dr. A. Madia\n\n",

The anxiety causes a very strong and rapid heartbeat in response to mild stress. I take the drug as infrequently as possible becasue of its addictiveness. I am also on the Nuva Ring for birth control.  For many years, I have had a rapid reasting heartbeat (90-100 bpm) I recently took my pulse after merely walking across a room and it was 120. Short walks or efforts seem to get me out of breath. In the last 3 or 4 months I have had three episodes of feeling like my heart \"skipped a beat\" accompanied by a feeling of almost passing out. This only lasts a few seconds. At the time that each of these episodes happened, I had not recently taken any meds and was not doing anything strenuous or under any kind of emotional stress. The first time I was lying on the sofa reading a good book!   I am scheduled for an echocardiogram today. All my EKGs have been normal.

    "content": "Hi.  The most common result that your Echocardiogram might show in  this instance  is a Mitral Prolapse. This is a condition where the valve leaflets are long and redundant and they slip or \"skid\" over each other when they close with a force during the systole.  This can cause occurence of \"missed\" beats, palpitation, fast pulse and even a syncope.  This is a totally benign condition, and more of a nuisance value. You may need to take Inderal 40 mg twice a day which will contol the pulse, the missed beats and even the anxiety part too.   Dr. A. Madia\n\n",

In the past (since my 30's) whenever Ihave attmepted excersize ie walking on a treadmill or Jazzercise or walking fast period, my heart rate quickly accelerates above the normal reccomended rate. Now that I am 50 and this is the most I have ever weighed, it is making me nervous. In order to get the heart rate down to a normal rate of 135-140 I have to walk at a slow pace. which seems to defeat the purpose.  I am wondering what could possibly be causng this? My doc really wants me to lose weight & excersize. I am 2 years in remission and the docs checked my heart several times during chemo and found everything fine.  Not tkaing any meds.\n\n",

    "content": "This is in response to lilnell's post: -First off, I am not a doctor, med student, etc. I do however, possess a large amount of knowledge related to exercise. With that said:  -If your doctors have checked your heart several times, then what you're experiencing during exercise likely isn't due to your heart. Yet at the same time, it is related to it. Since you have been (self-admittedly) inactive for several years, if you just suddenly start exercising your body will simply not be used to the exertion. An obvious response is increased heart-rate, along with side pains and breathlessness.   Due to the fact that exercise is something your body is not used to, and it sounds like you're 'out of shape,' you need to start off any exercise program extremely slow. If you try to do too much, you're running the risk of severe injury or worse. I'd recommend you speak to your doctor about what is and isn't appropriate for you to do, exercise-wise. He or she should review your medical history, your current phyiscal condition, and overall general health, and basically tell you what you can safely do to start off with. While it might not seem like much, any exercise is better than none. If you can only safely walk on a treadmill at 1.0mph, with no incline, so be it. You're exercising, and that's what counts.  Again, I am not a doctor or in any medical profession. The above is purely my input on your situation lilnell.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 24 year old man in good shape with no family history of heart disease.  Around two years ago my chest began to hurt.  The pain came on quickly, starting in the middle of my chest and spread all the way around to my back.  The pain would worsen with movement and breathing.  The pain would lessen when I would lie down. However, after lying down, I couldnt get up for about a half an hour due to the pain.   The next day, I went to the doctor, who gave me an EKG, and sent me home without a clear explaination (although ruling out a heart problem).  The pain slowly went away over the course of about 10 days.  This morning I the pain came back and once again I found myself immobilized for about a half hour.  Similarly to before the pain restrics movement and decreases when I lay down.  I am not sure if i should go back to the doctor or just wait for the pain to go away by itself.  The only previous medical condition I have had is an  back problem that seemed to effect my legs.  Not sure if the two have any connection.  Any advise would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  I am a 53yo male who had a \"cardiac episode\" 4 yrs ago.  I had what seemed to be gall bladder type pain for about 2 hours at a time over 3 days. When finally visiting a doctor who did some testing there were anomalies in my ECG (in the recovery portion of my heart beat).   After extensive testing including a thallium stress test it was decided to do an angiogram.  (The scan showed some area of damage.)  The doctors, expecting to see some major blockages, reported no blockages at all, and my heart was free of any deposits.  The blockage that caused the problem was probably a clot that cleared on its own.  I was pronounced free of disease and go live my life.  Since that time I have had on and off chest pain and palpitations.  Sometimes it's a sharp pain, other times a squeezing pain that slowly realeases, usually preceeded by several days of palpitations.   Since the event 4 yrs ago (diagnosed as a \"cardiac anomolie\") I have had 4 stress tests with thalium scans.  Each test shows a well functioning heart with no limitations.  Any signs of damage and ECG problems had quickly disappeared after the original event .  The ECG returned to normal within 3 weeks. The doctors are getting tired of my complaints, often diagnosed as costochondritis (to keep me happy!) and no one seems to be listening to my pain complaints which have been with me from the time of the original event.   I exercise regularly and I am about to train for a climb of Mt. Rainier this summer (the toughest endurance climb in the continental US).   I have been given a clean bill of health, but with this pain I have a nagging feeling one day I'll just keel over....not the worst way to go!  Frequent treadmill work and bicycling present no agina like pain, can exercise with intensity for some time.  Most of the pains I have are while sitting or being inactive. Any advice? I have seen my own doctor as well as a cardiologist over the last 4 yrs. Ron\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sweety,  Causes of left arm pain are many.  Right from a cardiac anginal pain it could be a pain from cervical spondylosis, frozen shoulder, fibromyalgia, etc.  From the description of your symptoms it looks more like a spondylosis. I would advise you to get an X ray of Cervical Spine Lateral view and if spondylosis is threre you will need to take Physiotherapy, Short Wave diathermy and Traction to relieve the pain. after a 2 week course of the same you may continue physiotherapy exercises at home.  Cardiac pain at your age { in a woman of menstruating age } is quite uncommon although not unknown. If tou have predisposing factors like a family history, High Blood pressure, Diabetes mellitus, or High lipid levels, you may require and Echo and a stress ECG.  Get back to me with the result of the Cervical X ray and also with more details if required.  Dr A. Madia,\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 26-year old male, 5'9\", about 20 to 30 pounds overweight. Don't smoke, drink in moderation. No current medications. No past diagnoses of medical conditions, no surgeries. Both parents alive, in mid-50s, father is obese with high cholesterol and hypertension, no heart attacks in either case, but mother has a congenital heart murmur. About three years ago, I started intermittently (a few times per month) experiencing a feeling of weakness centered in my chest, as though my heart skipped a beat, although I don't really know what happened. It lasted about 1 second or less and it felt like I lost all my strength for an instant. It usually occurred while sitting down, but sometimes seemed to be triggered by standing up. It was usually in connection with a brief period of excitement. But it never occurred in connection with exertion due to exercise (I did a cardio workout, 45-min with a 150 heartrate average almost every day for six months). About 6 weeks ago, the symptoms got worse: feelings of weakness several times per day (occurred sometimes while completely calm and relaxed), which was a lot more frequent, plus a chronic feeling of tension and pain in the chest. There was occasionally a burning sensation in the chest. I ate a lot of unhealthy, processed foods, and I thought for some reason it might have something to do with sodium. I cut my intake to about 500 mg a day. The symptoms went away completely after 3 or 4 days. This was about 3 weeks ago. I started doing cardio exercises again, with no ill effects. Earlier tonight, I was sitting on the couch and felt two instances of weakness within 30 seconds. They were both accompanied by stabbing pains in the middle of the chest. Neither lasted more than 2 seconds. I never felt this sharp pain before. Today I wasn't so careful and probably ate about 2000 mg of sodium over the course of the day before this happened. I was worried mostly by the stabbing pain, which never happened before.   My question is, would these symptoms normally be associated with salt intake? What are the conditions that might explain this? Do you think the situation might be urgent? At this point I don't have insurance. I just got a new job and my insurance coverage starts in about 2 months, and I would like to see a cardiologist then. I did see two different GPs about it a while back, before the period of increased symptoms, they took my blood pressure (don't know what it was), listened to my chest, said it was probably stress. I didn't press the matter, unfortunately.  Thank you for your time and for any input.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  You look like having venticular ectopics from your description. In common language it is known as 'missed beats'. They come and go any time and they are more prone to occur at the time of excitement. At your age the reason could simply be a Mitral Prolapse. This is an innocent condition and easily treatable.  The relation with sodium intake is a little tenuous. Sodium would increase the BP but this would not generally cause missed beats. It is likely that all foods containing high sodium would also be high in oils and spices. These would in turn lead to hyperacidity and reflux in to the esophagus and this CAN cause ectopics in some patients.  My advice is, take it easy, reduce your salt intake,and wait out for 2 months, it wont harm you. As soon as 2 months are over, consult a cardiologist, get ECG, Stress ECG and Echocardiogram done, and the diagnosis will be clear.   Dr. A. Madia\n\n",

May be you also need a stress ECG and an Echocardiogram depending and the results of the routine medical.  Also you need to check your Lipid Profile ['cholesterol'].  You drink too much. Stop it right away. This quantity of alcohol, if nothing else could produce a lot of acidity which might regurgitate in your food pipe and produce chest symptoms.

I don't think it's heart-related b/c my pulse is normal and the pain doesn't radiate.  It's been hurting for a few hours now, ranging from a dull ache to feeling like someone's driving an ice pick through my chest wall.  It gets worse when I move my head or shoulders in certain ways, and breathing deeply while walking seems to make it worse.  I can't make any sudden movements at all, but I can breathe deeply while seated without extra pain.  I'm not sick today and I haven't done any unusual activities lately.  I'd appreciate your thoughts on what it could be.  Thanks very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Yesterday, after eating a fairly heavy dinner, I came down with rather odd symptoms (for me). A 'heaviness' in my upper chest, centralized around the top of the sternum.  It persisted for several hours, and made me rather concerned. My heart never became distressed - my heartbeat never seemed to be particularly strong nor fast - and I wasn't weak, but I felt like I had to take slow deep breaths.  Later when I laid down, my chest felt very full, but it quickly subsided.  Today I once again have the symptoms, and any exertion - like running - causes me to get light-headed.  I'm currently in Lima, Peru, and was in Cuzco (elevation 3500m about - definite altitude effects there), and I did a fair bit of hiking this past weekend, with no ill effects.  Any ideas what it could be? I'll see a doctor when I'm home in a few days.   Thanks for your time!  --Mike\n\n",

I know it's impossible to diagnose on a website and I wouldn't ask for that.

If yes it is likely that it is heart pain.  On the other hand   Does it increase in intensity on deep breathing or coughing?  Does it pain more on pressing at the site of pain?  If yes, the its from the ribs or the muscles.  However the final answer only a stress EKG and Echocardiogram will give.  meanwhile you urgently need to reduce your weight even further.   A.

    "content": "Hello Sweetish,  Before anything, let me just preface this by stating that I am a student doctor.  As always, no internet medical professional can substitute for the knowledge and experience of your family doctor.    Before anything, it's important that you answer the following questions to gauge a better understanding of what's going on.  1. What is your past medical history? 2. Are you taking any medications?  3. Besides the gallbladder removal and c-sections, have you had any other hospitalizations/ surgeries? 4. What is your social history (i.e Diet, Alcohol, Smoking, Married, Kids)?  Otherwise, in regards to your complaint, it sounds a lot like anxiety.  With the amount of televised ads for heart attacks and depression, it's not uncommon for anxiety to kick into effect.   Coupling that along with your family history, it's not hard to understand that you would be apprehensive.    I would recommend that you and your doctor set a goal for your health.  If you are classified as being overweight, you should plan to eat healither and exercise.  Afterall, chances of experiencing heart disease significantly reduce with exercise, healthy diet, smoking cessation, and healthy social interactions!  I would urge you to relax and distract yourself when commercials about  heart attack and depression come on.    As far as more tests are concerned, it is a possiblity that you are experiencing some esophogeal related symptoms.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm 29 and female. I've experienced for the past months many symptoms that are getting hard to cope with, but I haven't told my Dr, in fear that it might be just an anxiety disorder. The Dr did tell me I have a heart murmur (she discovered it last week on a routinary examination) and asked me to have an echocardiogram done in a few months (When my insurance will cover the cost) As I didn't mention any symptoms or anything she said that we'll know in that test but that she thought it was a functional or innocent heart murmur, since I don't have any other symptoms. The cardiologist who did an electrocardiogram told me to have that test done as soon as my insurance covers it (3 months from now) Well, the symptoms I've been having for the past months (which could very well be part of an anxiety disorder) are: - I can't breathe, I find it really hard to breathe, even when I'm not nervous or anything, when I'm walking, or when I\"m in bed, or wherever or even having a good time. I start to feel all out of breath. I get a sharp chest pain, as if my heart skipped a heartbeat, or couldn't beat well, it beats strongly and it hurts in my chest, and it makes me dizzy and has made me faint several times. I find it really hard to cope with the shortness of breath and the sharp pain in my chest, it makes me faint. I've often put a wet towel on my chest to relieve the pain but it feels so hard, as if someone were pressing really tight on my chest and not letting me breathe  or my heart beat. It is a sharp pain and lack of breath. What other symptoms should I look for?  Of course, those symptoms I've mentioned could be symptoms of anxiety/panic attacks, so I truly don't know if I should take them seriously or not.  Thanks in advance for any info you can give me.  I was embarrassed to mention these symptoms to my Dr when she mentioned the heart murmur, because I am afraid they might just be a sign of severe anxiety.   Please can you help?  Thanks Julie (29)\n\n",

So when the valve closes the leaflets either buckle up or \"skid\" just like a car tyre skidding on wet road. This is a benign condition and does nor produce any complications apart from anxiety on the patients part.  You should undergo an Echocardiogram to confirm this and also a stress test just to rule out any serious ischemic heart problem.  But just relax and enjoy life rather than worry about heart. If confirmed to be a mitral prolapse, two tabs of Inderal a fay will resolve the issue.   Dr. A Madia\n\n",

However other causes of high pulse rate should be ruled out. One is Hyperthyroidism which can be tested from a simple blood test. Other is an EKG which, given your family hsitory of heart idsease and tachycardia  may reveal some cause for it.  Avoid taking oral contraception, your acne for which you take antibiotic is infact due to the pills.   Dr. A. Madia\n\n",

Numbness in arm occurs at same time as tightness in chest.  Symptoms seem to be worse after eating and early in the morning.  I am recently coming off of the flu.  Should these symptoms cause me significant concern?   What advice could you give me to relieve these symptoms if you feel that they are not cardiovascular related?

However the symptoms you describe are all in the line of Acid Peptic disease since they are occuring either on empty stomach or immediately after a meal.   One point though demands attention that is your left arm pains at the same time as the tightness in your chest. Since you have a strong family history I strongly advice you to undergo the following tests:  1. Lipid Panel 2. EKG 3. Stress EKG 4.2D Echo-Doppler 5.Fasting and post prandial blood sugar.  Once cardiac cause is ruled out, start on antacid treatment .   A. Madia.\n\n",

    "content": "My story starts about 7 months ago, I was at work and suddenly started having a pain in my chest. I went to the ER to be checked out and everything was reported to be fine. The pains came and went in no particular pattern for the next week or so, I went to see my GP who arranged for some tests to try and fatham out what the cause of my problems were. This pain was getting worse and I was starting to have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, and pins and needles (Pins and needles probably caused by Hyperventilation). I was admitted to hospital for in depth tests and amonst other tests I had a CT Scan and an MRI scan, the report came back stating I had a 3mm \"Nodule\" on the Pituitry Gland at the base of my Brain, this came as a sevre shock to my system as I was taken into hospital with chest pains!. Now the Nodule was reported not to be cancerous and they were happy to let me go after 5 days in Hospital. Now my chest pains are still there, not as bad as before, but the main concern I have is I am often having what I can only describe as a Skipped Beat sensation, it comes out of the blue and makes me jump, its a strange sensation that moves up my body, this is very worring to me and I am truly petrified there is something wrong with my heart or something else major. To date I have had 2 Echocardiograms, numerous chest/back X-Rays, a CT Scan, an MRI Scan, a Barium Meal, 24 Heart Monitor test, and I have lost count on the amount of Blood tests I have gone through. I have had a slight Pericardial Effusion which was very very minimal and my 24 hour heart test reported 1 ectopic beat.   I am still getting these sensations, even as I write this, my doctors are baffled Im baffled and I feel I have no were to turn. Im scared to go to work in case something happens, im scared to drive to far away from home in case im on my own and something happens, its a joke. I feel depressed, I cant sleep at night as im frightened in case I never wake up. I cant go to my doctor as I get the impression he is fed up of seeing me, I cant go to Hospital as I need to be referred by my doctor, I cant go Private as I need to be referred by my doctor. So Im left asking myself what do i do, do I wait until whatever is causing this Kills me, or do I beat it to it. Before I had this problem I was a fun loving normal 22 year old guy who enjoed life, enjoyed his work, and was truly happy, now im so far away from that I could just sit down and cry, and for me to say that is a big thing.   If anyone can offer any advice, or any answers as to what it might be, or if anyone reads this and has experienced simalar problems then please please reply to this as I really am scared and I don't know what to do next.  Sean\n\n",

    "content": "If you don't feel comfortable going back to your present doctor I guess I would suggest finding another one. Nothing wrong with a second opinion. It's my experience that some docs don't take people seriously enough. If you feel you're not being treated right or taken seriously enough then definitely go elsewhere. Even if you're just scared. I always tell people to go with your gut. If you feel something isn't right then get it checked out. As far as you \"beating the disease to it\" as you said...if you're seriously thinking about hurting yourself then you should speak to someone about that also. If you tell your doctor this then maybe it'll hit home for him a little better how serious this is to you. Well, I hope you feel better soon. Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "This is the only thread that was open for posting; I apologize for tagging on to this one,  I'm just not sure whether or not I should be concerned about myself or not and would appreciate some/any kind of insight.   My question is about pain I experience in my chest usually in the early morning hours and a few times very late at night (it has tended to be between 4-7am; sometimes I think it may wake me up). The feeling is more like squeezing or twinges of localized pain on the left/center side of my chest and isn\u2019t severe.  It typically lasts from just a few minutes to 30 minutes (not continuous pain, but twinges within a 30 minute period).  It doesn\u2019t happen every morning and I can go weeks or months without it happening at all before it starts again. (For example, it had stopped happening at the end of June and didn\u2019t start again until the first of October.  It stopped a few weeks later and has only started again in the past week.  The longest interval  it has ever been occurred within this most recent round, lasting from a little after 6:00am until 10:30am and then happening infrequently throughout the afternoon and into the evening - which it hasn\u2019t done before).  The pain never happens when I\u2019m doing any physical activity or exercise. I also never experience any other symptoms with it and have not noticed any predictable patterns (other than it tending to happen or start in the early morning hours).    When I think about it, I can recall it happening as far back as about 4-5 years, though I don\u2019t recall how frequent or infrequent it was then. I know it probably seems ridiculous that I\u2019ve waited to ask about it, but I have trouble imagining that it\u2019s too serious -   I am a 25 year old female, 5\u20195 and 115-120lbs. I exercise pretty regularly (mostly run), have a healthy diet, usually manage stress well, and don\u2019t tend to get sick.  I also don\u2019t have a history of heart disease in my family. All this to say, with no specific risk factors for heart trouble, it hasn\u2019t concerned me enough to see a doctor specifically for this and when I have by chance been to a doctor, it hasn\u2019t been during a phase of it, so I haven\u2019t thought to ask.  I\u2019ve assumed that it\u2019s just my body waking up or working out its kinks.... but with this last time of it starting up again, I\u2019ve been wondering about it much more.    Any thoughts on this? Is it something I should be concerned about?  Thanks for taking the time to read all this and volunteering to help so many.\n\n",

I found that taking a hot shower helped relieve the pain, but it ended up coming back in the middle of the night.  Again, I went into the shower and it helped relieve the pressure and pain.  I have no idea what could have caused it, should I be worried and go to the doctors, or wait and see if I get another episode of the pain/pressure?  Thank you.\n\n",

I've had an EKG, ECG, X-RAY and Bloodtests and they came out positive (haven't got results from EKG or ECG but the cardiologist giving me tests said everything looked positive). My doctor says it may be minor arrythmia or Mitral Valve Prolapse.

The pain seems to be an aching pain, or sometimes a stabbing/shooting pain. It will sometimes last for a couple seconds to minutes or even all day. As for family, my father is the only one who has had MVP.  I also get PVC's quite frequently, especially when changing positions such as sitting to lying. I am extremely worried that something worse may be wrong with me. Could it even be anxiety?\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you very much for using our website.   Palpitations is the sensation of feeling your heart beats.   Normally we do not feel our hearts beating because they beat in a regular fashion (rhythm and rate) and we are accustomed to the strength of the beat so it does not disturb us.   If there is a change in the strength or any irregularity of the heart rhythm or change in the heart rate (whether racing or slowing), then we will start feeling our heart beating.   Having palpitations is a common frequent complaint among healthy young adults. To make sure that there is nothing going on, usually, an ECG is done together with some blood tests including a thyroid function test and also an echocardiogram is sometimes done to exclude mitral valve prolapse, a common condition that causes palpitations.   If you still have these palpitations, after all possibilities have been persued, and they are really bothering you, the best thing to do is to take a beta-blocker type medication such as inderal which helps both arrhythmia and anxiety.   A heart rate of 180 is obviously much higher than normal. How long does is this high rate sustained and how frequent is this problem? Certainly, a sustained tachycardia of this sort can stress the heart in more ways than one. A sustained tachycardia is also something should be investigated. I would suggest you consult with a cardiologist.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ryan,  The sensitivity and specificity of the ekg at diagnosing chamber hypertrophy or enlargement whether right or left, atrium or ventricle, is not that good. The best tool at diagnosing the size of heart chambers is the echocardiogram. If the echo says that your right ventrile is ok, then it is ok if the person who interpreted the echo is a well trained cardiologist (which i assume nearly all cardiologist are).  Some ekg machines interpret ekgs automatically and if you read the interpretation without having the doctor look at it and confirm it then this is invalid, because a doctor has to confirm this interpretation before it is officical.  There are certain criteria to diagnose right ventricular hypertrophy. Do you know how was right ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed on your ekg? One of these criteria actually is considered a normal pattern in many patients.  Your ekg looks like this and that's it and you don't have to worry about it.   Regarding the mi, anything could have gone wrong while taking the ekg for that pattern to appear, you might have been in expiration rather than in inspiration when they were taking the ekg. You don't have any risk factors for coronary disease and the chest pain that you are feeling does not sound typical as compared to the pain of coronary origin, so the probability that the pain be of coronary origin is very low and consequently (and specially since ekgs are not the best tool at diagnosing coronary disease), this mi pattern that appeared once is not to be taken into consideration as a reliable piece of information when it comes to trying to see whether or not you have coronary disease.  You had an echocardiogram and if you had a previous mi, it would have shown on the echocardiogram as abnormal pattern of heart contraction. Since your echo was normal then you did not have an mi before.  You don't have to worry about anything.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "As a Cardiologist I second the response from Dr Mokhtar.  The EKG is not as sensitive or specific as an echocardiogram.   The advice you received from your cardiology consult is the most sound.  EKG's are tempermental and subjective and as the other reply stated. RVH has many different criteria and may be seen in \"normal\" hearts.     Your best bet would be to follow up once a year or so, keep your \"risk factors\" under control.  Watch your blood pressure, aerobic exercises, 4-5 times per week.   Again, I would question who made that first interpretation of RVH and MI,  you would be suprised by how lax EKG training is today in the ERA of echos and automatic EKG computer interpreting.  Some fellow cardiologist state that the only qualified interpreters of EKG's are cardiologists.....  Good luck and don't stress about this.  Tom\n\n",

He explains it as a sharp pain that doesn't seem like it will end but it only lasts for five minutes at the very most.  It's just an annoying pain that he considers maybe a '4' on a scale of 1-10.  He has gone to his family doctor who then referenced him to the emergency because he said that they do not have the correct equipment to test him.  They took a few tests which he is unable to recall and could find nothing wrong.  Lately, Joe has started getting short of breath.  He is not wheezing but simply has a hard time taking a breath and at some points cannot take a breath at all.  There doesn't seem to be a pattern, it's happened in the shower, in his sleep, and even just sitting watching tv.  Dizziness follows due to lack of oxygen and he almost passed out in the shower.    Joe does not drink or smoke, he has gained maybe five pounds in the last few months, but that is the only change I can think of.  He is twenty one years old and has an inside sales job.  I'm wondering if this has to due with a heart condition and we should see a cardiologist or if it has to do with something else.  Please help.\n\n",

    "title": "Severe Chest Pain - DES? Strangulated Hiatal Hernia? Angina?",
    "content": "I am a 46 year old female, a smoker, and overweight.I  have been having severe chest pains for about 4 years which are now increasing in frequency to 3-4 times per week. I'm not sure if they are cardiac or GI in origin. About 6 out of 10 times the pain occurs while eating/swallowing. The pain is located about mid-sternum and is very sudden and severe and is accompanied by dizziness, cold and clammy skin, and most of the time with syncope. My husband witnessed one of these yesterday and said it lasted for about 20 seconds. He said when I passed out my eyes rolled back and my arms bent at the elbows and came in toward my chest as in spasms. When I \"came to\" I was awake and alert with no post-ictal symptoms. I have a remote history (1998) of post head injury seizures (grand mal and absence). I have been symtom free since 1999. Other medical history is positive for hypothyroidism and HRT for TAH/BSO.  I've been reading about GERD and Hiatal Hernia with Strangulation and also Diffuse Esophageal Spasms. I wonder if one of these could be the cause. I do not have heartburn or other symptoms of GERD. I need to add that I do have a very high tolerance for pain but this pain is absolutely excrutiating. I have a strong family history of cardiac disease (father died at 42 from MI, mother had 2 MI's in her 50's). I have mild MVP and palpitations.  As mentioned, a little more than half the time it occurs when I am eating but has frequently happened while driving, walking, sitting, sleeping, etc. I am calm and relaxed when it occurs. Position does not affect the pain. When the pain begins I do of course pull over if I'm driving.    I would appreciate your input very much.  Thank you in advance, Dorothy\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Mokhtar,  Until just a few weeks ago, I had no health insurance so I have not sought medical attention for the chest pains nor have I told my doctor about them. I see my doctor only once per year for med refills (Premarin since 1984, Synthroid since 1998, and Celebrex for arthritis since 2003, and daily low-dose aspirin since 2003 because of long-term HRT). The reason I have not told him is because I knew he would order a variety of tests which at the time were completely out of the question due to the lack of insurance.  I have not tried nitroglycerin for the pain (can it be obtained without prescription?). I have tried antacids which did nothing. After the pain is gone, I do not have any residual pain or other symptoms.   I don't have any symptoms of GERD such as indigestion, heartburn, or reflux.  I do not have hypertension or diabetes. During a pregnancy in 1982 I did have an echocardiogram, stress test and a 24-hour holter monitor which revealed mild MVP with PVC's. I was not placed on any meds or treatments for this. I do have what I presume are PVC's (frequent palpitations) and my doctor has noted a mid-systolic click on physical exam (MVP). I have occasional swelling of my feet and legs up to my knees with pitting edema for which I take Lasix as needed. This occurs only a few times a year and no other symptoms accompany it.  I do have a strong family history of cardiac disease, however. My father died at 42 from MI (with prior CVA) and my mother had 2 MI's in her 50's and died of MI at 61. My brother has had non-insulin dependent diabetes since the age of 25. Both paternal and maternal grandparents all died from cancer (colon, esophageal, lung CA). There is no other significant medical history.  Again, thank you so much for your reply. I hope this additional information will help. I'm somewhat relieved to hear the passing out may just be from pain. (although I'm surprised since I tolerate pain very well).  Dorothy\n\n",

    "title": "Update on Chest Pain from Dorothy, Mar 2004",
    "content": "After a battery of cardiac tests, all of which were negative, I finally insisted on a referral to a Gastroenterologist. I had an Upper GI study - negative. I then had an esophageal motility study (which measures the pressure in the esophagus). .....  Lo and behold they figured out what was wrong. It turns out that my severe chest pain was due to a relatively rare condition called 'Nutcracker Esophagus'.    Nutcracker Esophagus causes extreme chest pain as severe as angina.  In a nutshell (pun intended), and from my layman's understanding of the condition:  The normal pressure in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus should be about 40mm. The esophagus  contracts and relaxes (peristalsis) in order to move food, liquid, saliva down the esophagus into the stomach.  In my case, instead of having a normal pressure in the 40mm neighborhood, mine was at 190mm. And this was at rest with no pain occuring.  This high pressure causes the esphagus to contract with extreme force and, subsequently, severe pain.   There is not a definitive treatment for Nutcracker Esophagus but in some cases Procardia has shown some success. Procardia is normally used to decrease the strength of the heart's  contractions. Since the heart and esophagus are both muscles, it sometimes helps with Nutcracker Esphagus. In my case, my chest pain symptoms have decreased from 20+ per month to 4-5 per month. Excellent!  The drawback is that because the heart's contractions are also affected by the Procardia, edema and hypertension are a problem. This is taken care of by anti-hypertensives (Diovan) and diuretics (Lasix).  While I'm happy the doctors finally figured out what was wrong, I sure wish they had listened to me when I suggested it might be DES - Diffuse Esophageal Spasms. They would have helped me a year ago.   One last sad update. I mentioned in my family history that I had a brother with insulin dependent diabetes. He passed away 6 months ago at the age of 35 of a massive heart attack.  Good luck to all and keep looking until you find a doctor who will listen to you. Dorothy\n\n",

About 6 months ago I had a severe case of bronchitis, to the point where I was coughing up blood. My physician put me on antibiotics and suggested I get a bronchial test done, which I never did. Since that time, occasionally after just waking up in the mornings, it would be extremely painful to draw a breath but it would dissapate after a few minutes. Now, the pain has lasted over the past few hours instead of going away after 10 or 15 minutes. It almost feels like I'm breathing in water, only there's that sharp pain in my lungs. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 30 year old female and I have been told by my doctor that I have been suffering with \"Panic attacks.\" I have been having these panic attacks since I became pregnant with my first child in 1994. It started with rapid heart beats, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness. As I get older these attacks seem to happen more often and on days when I feel less stressed and more relaxed. It will hit me without any warning.  During this past week I have been getting this \"aching\" feeling in my chest \"right between my breast,\" and it simply comes and goes. There isn't any sweating, getting sick at my stomach or any jaw/neck pain. Just a constant ache in my chest that sometimes lasts for over a minute each time and sometimes only 5 minutes between the onset of another \"ache.\" It seems to be worse at night and when I lay down to go to sleep.  Last night my left wrist and arm started aching and it tingled just like it was \"asleep.\" I'm not having any problems with it now however. Going to bed anymore is a terror. Often times my heart with skip a beat, flutter..etc when I am having a panic attack, but I have noticed that my heart is doing this more often now. It will flutter, skip a beat, beat so fast and hard that you can see it through my shirt, sometimes it even feels like it stops and when this happens I lose my breath for a few seconds and everything seems to go back to normal once I get my breath back. This is becoming more common during the time I am laying in bed.  I am a smoker, but I am not overweight. I do not excerise much because I fear the onset of a panic attack or worse.. a heart attack. My mom has high blood pressure and so does my dad, but my blood pressure tends to stay around 109-112 over 83-87 and my heart rate around 98. However, 4 out of 10 times that I check my blood pressure it will be as low as 99/83 and my heart rate 85 \"this was my reading just the other night.\" My dad is 50 years old and he has been seeing a heart doctor because of his high blood pressure. He hasn't had a heart attack as of yet, but the heart doctor does keep a very close eye on him.  Do you feel that something more is going on with me than just panic attacks? And why are they getting worse and coming more often? I will admit that I get stressed out very easily.. having two small kids will sometimes do that to you. Thank you so much in advance, I simply dread going to bed anymore.. even though the chest \"ache,\" started tonight way before I even thought about going to bed. Should I be concerned?  Tina\n\n",

My heart skips beats at least 10 times a minute or more, when I am talking with my friends, eating or engrossed in a subject or activity, I don't notice it skip at all. But when my mind is on my heart, I feel is skip like crazy, probably 15 times a minute and it seems to be getting worse every day. I have been to the doctor in the past and their diagnosis is that there is nothing wrong, I disagree with them. There are also times that when my heart skips beats, my heartbeat slows down considerably after the skip, don't know why. Some of my friends tell me that their heartbeats skips 5 times a minute when they actually feel their pulse, but when they don't feel their pulse, they don't notice it, I notice it without feeling my pulse. Then there are times when my heart skips, but as it skips it feels as if there are 2 heartbeats at the same time *thump, thump*  This really starting to frustrate me, and I can't seem to pinpoint the cause, I eat right, exercise, take vitamins, get plenty of rest, and happy go lucky without much stress, what is going on?      Any feedback would be appreciated. THANKS!\n\n",

This problem didn't occur until 5 years ago and sometimes goes away for about a month or two then returns, this time its worse then ever. I rarely drink alcohol or take something with caffiene and quit taking energy supplements and this still occurs. Furtheremore I understand that caffiene, alcohol and energy supplements can cause palpitations because of the increased heart rate, but my heartbeat is from 65-75 beats per minute and this still occurs.\n\n",

I do have an appt. at the end of the month with a cardiologist.  At this time I am having sharp, very short pains on the left side of my chest.  They come and go and I do not have them everyday.  I also have a dull ache under my left shoulder blade.  This is usually everyday.  It almost feels like a muscle ache.  Sometimes I feel my heart quicken and I do feel a little lightheaded.  I know that it is possible to worry so much that I can experience symptoms.  Is this something I should call and discuss with the doctor now, or can it wait until the end of the month?\n\n",

    "content": "The short, sharp sticky pains are not consistent with the type of chest pain related to CAD; the ache under your shoulder blade could be many things as well.  You are right, worry can exacerbate symptoms and increase pulse rate.    A borderline stress is  no diagnosis of coronary disease; if it was definitive you would have been sent to a cardiologist for an angiogram immediately.  When an equivocal result occurs, the next step is a consult with a cardiologist just to get a definitive diagnosis and/or further testing. There are many factors that can cause a \"borderline\" result, very few of which end up being coronary disease.    If you are still very bothered by the discomfort and worried, it would be a good idea to call your doctor for his opinion.\n\n",

    "title": "Chest pain - chest moving with my heartbeat",
    "content": "Hello, I am hoping some one can give me some insight as to what is going on with me.  I am a 22 year old female with no real history of health problems.  All my symptoms started a little over a year ago.  I have chest pain everyday.  It it always under my left breast, sometimes it is in the center, like at the bottom of my breastbone & sometimes it is closer to the far left side of my chest.  Sometimes I feel it when I exercise, but I really think that is because I start thinking about it & get worried.  My left shoulder & arm seem to always ache also.  This really scares me.  I feel like I am going to drop dead of a heart attack.  Even if my chest is not hurting, it is like I am always aware of my heart.  Even if it is not beating hard or anything I just am constantly thinking about it.  Also, I can always see my chest moving with my heartbeat.  That really scares me.  About a year ago when all this started I went to the doctor & they did an ekg, holter monitor & an echocardiogram.  The ekg came up abnormal, but I think that was because my heart was beating so fast because I was scared to death.  The holter & the echo both came back with good results.  The doctor diagnosed me with anxiety.   I really don't feel like this is all anxiety/panic though.  I have the chest pain all the time, even when I am not anxious at all.  Is it possible to have the physical symptoms even when you are not in an anxious state?  I think what really scares me is that for a while before all this started I had taken a weight loss drug with ephedra in it for a while.  I am so scared that I have damaged my heart some how.  I'm also scared that with all the symptoms I am having that the doctors have missed something.  I hope that some one can make sense of all this & maybe give me some input.  Thanks..\n\n",

Yes, they can be present when you don't think you are anxious.  You are anxious and low level panicing due to the fact that you are always thinking about it and aware of your heartbeats, even when have no symptoms.

    "content": "Obviously, I cannot rule out something as dangerous as a cardiac cause for your chest pain over the internet, but according to your description this chest pain is probably not secondary to coronary disease.  Actually, your problem doesn't seem to be cardiac in nature. The fact that you can increase the pain by breathing deeply suggests a musculoskeletal problem, probably costochondritis.  It's an inflammation of the cartiledge between the ribs and the sternum.  It is caused by a strain of some sort, usually you won't remember doing it, and is treated with antiinflammatories.  Ask your doctor first, as they have side effects.\n\n",

    "content": "In Nov.2004, my heart rate went up to 102. My normal rate has been about 75.  I was 56 at that time.  I was very scared and of course this made my heart rate climb.  When I'm scared, I do not eat and lost quite a bit of weight.  I only weighted 125 to begin with. Went to my Family Dr.  She did an EKG which was okay and put me on lexapro.  After 3 days, had a burning sensation across chest.  Tried another brand, and the same thing happened.  Went on Ativan .5 mg 3x a day.  This helped but wanted me on something else that lasted longer. She ordered an echostress test, chest x-ray,  blood tests which were all fine.  Got heart rate up to 100% on the echostress test which they said was a great evaluation.  Okay too.  Still was having trouble.  In Feb. I went back to the doctor and did another EKG (heartrate was 120). It had changed from the last one.  She immediately sent me to the hospital by ambulance.  Had another blood test to determine a heart attack, another chest x-ray and stress test.  Okay. Still said it was anxiety. Said my EKG was \"normal\" for me.  Which I don't really understand. She then put me on klonopin .5 mg twice a day which I'm still on.  My heartrate is around 80-85 now which is better.  I'm worried about getting off of it also.  But not ready yet.  I look forward to the time to take it.  So since Nov. I'm still not \"myself\".  I don't do anything around the house and stay on the computer most of the time.  That's not like me.  I'm having a colonoscopy in two weeks and am very nervous about the results.  Not so much the procedure, but the results.  My stool has changed.  The colon dr. said it could be the medication.  I also take Atenol for bones one a week and suppliements of calcium.  Thank you for our time and advice.  I just want to be my \"old\" self again and to stop worrying about my health.  I don't look forward to anything....dread it when I make a commitment.  My Mother is 87 and need to help her too with Dr. appointments, etc.  I've read that most of my problems are with younger people....19-25 and decreases with age.  Not in my case.  Again, thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Your meds can indeed cause constipation, especially the calcium supplements.   Try mixing a fiber drink daily such as Metamucil or Citrucel.  (No bloating/gas with the Citrucel).  Along with that, make sure you get plenty of fiber in your diet as well.  Foods like oatmeal, whole wheat and bran cereal, whole wheat bread and most vegetables are good sources.    Anytime someone, especially those over 50, has a change in bowel habits a colonoscopy is ordered; very slim chance it's cancer, but it needs to be ruled out, of course.    It could also be irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is triggered by anxiety and stress.  There are myriads of causes for constipation.  You are suffering depression, anxiety, and possible mild panic disorder,  they often  usually go together.  I suggest you see a psychiatrist, as they are specialists in mental health and can find the right combination of meds to treat your condition.  Most insurance plans do not require a referral to them, due to the confidential nature.  Your heart symptoms are common with anxiety, rest assured you're fine as far as cardiac problems are concerned.\n\n",

    "content": "About a year ago I went to the dr with dizziness, confusion, lightheadedness and arythmia.   After many tests, the only thing found to be abnormal was my potassium levels. They prescribed a supplement, and after a few days I felt much better. It seems about every 35-45 days I have an \"attack\" where my potassium goes extremely  low, and I go through all the symptoms to the point of not being able to function from the dizziness. At my  last visit my supplement was increased. On Friday, the symptoms came on again, and I (on my own) started doubling up on my potassium.  By the time I got to the doctor today I was feeling much better, and my potassium was at a normal level.  I also have severe bouts of diarrea, unexplained, and I know this can affect potassium levels as well.  My physician doesn't seem to be concerned with my potassium.  However, the levels seem to jump and it is affecting my everyday life.  I cannot work if I cannot bear to stand up.  I have resolved myself that I need a specialist to check into this, I am unsure what kind of specialist though.    I am posting this question here, because my doctor seems more concerned with volume in the office than finding answers, and I am at a very low point emotionally concerning my health and not getting answers.     Thank you in advance.\n\n",

My normal potassium level while taking the prescription is 3.6.  I realize this is only slightly above normal.  I think there should be more concerned with the fact that with prescription supplementation, I am still borderline.    Am I correct to feel they should be looking for the cause rather than just giving a prescription?  Or am I over anxious over something that is likely \"no big deal\"?\n\n",

Also when i swallow sometimes i feel like somethings in my throat as in it feels weired to swallow and then if i ignorit it, it sumtimes goes away after 15 minutes, or just has a \"numb\" feeling.  Though my neck pains have been lower to were your coller bone gets \"were the bone ends were there is a soft spot\\hole\" to about half way up the neck with sharp pains.

    "title": "Weird Chest Sensation",
    "content": "I'm a 37 year old white male, 5'7\" tall, 215 pounds.  For the past 3 days, when I lay down, especially if I cough or do anything that puts pressure in my chest, I get this weird sensation in my heart area. It feels lumpy and squirty as if my heart were pumping tapioca pudding through a narrow orifice. It lasts about 3-5 heart beats. It happens every time I roll over in bed so it is keeping me awake. I also notice palpitations throughout the day but especially when I lay down.  Sitting here, my pulse is 59 and I have a very mild ache in my chest. I think the ache may be from doing too many push-ups 3 days ago (when this all started).  For the past 2 months I've been aerobically walking and running 6 days per week 30-60 minutes per day. I also work out with weights and do a little yoga. I'm trying to lose my extra tonnage:)  Approximately 3 weeks ago, I had trouble with rapid heartbeat (over 200 bpm, too fast to be more accurate). It took me a few days to figure out the Benedryl I was taking every night for insomnia caused it. Everything seemed to return to normal after a day or two but I wonder if maybe I caused some sort of permanent damage that is only now showing up?  Years ago when taking SSRI medications I also experienced the rapid heartbeat.  I don't feel out of breath, ill, anxious or light headed. Running and walking actually seems to make me feel better while I do it, but I do notice that my symptoms seem worse a few hours after a workout. I stopped doing push-ups and sit-ups because they do make it worse.  I have about $20 cash and no insurance.  How desperately do I need to see a doctor? Should I probably stop all exercise until I somehow figure out a way to see a doctor? If this is most likely nerves, please tell me because seeing a doctor is going to cause me tremendous inconvenience.\n\n",

    "content": "We cannot tell you if you do or do not need to see your doctor; if it is just palpitations, they are usually harmless, but if your pulse suddenly races to 200 bpm, that's a different story.  Benadryl is not known to cause this as a side effect.  Overdoing the push ups can cause an inflammation in the cartiledge between the ribs and sternum which hurts and can be made better/worse by certain positions or even taking a deep breath.  Of course, if that is the case, cease the push ups, but the weight lifting is basically the same thing, and if you do continue these, it won't heal.  This can be treated with antiinflammatories.  Ask your doctor if they would be safe for you to take.  You may be working out too hard; 5 days per week is recommended.  Your body and muscles need a chance to rest and recover a couple of times per week.  Make sure you are eating enough of the right foods to sustain your workouts and not put excessive stress on the body.  Palpitations can be caused by anxiety, also stress, alcohol, tobacco, caffeine of any kind, and lack of sleep or irregular sleep schedule.  If these symptoms are bothersome to you, seek a doctor's opinion.\n\n",

Your age of 27 is too young (but not unheard of) to be having CAD symptoms; the plaque that blocks arteries takes many years to accumulate.  Most CAD sufferers don't have symptoms until middle age or later in life.  Of course there are exceptions to every rule in medicine, but your pain doesn't sound cardiac in nature.  Cardiac chest pain cannot be made worse or better by positioning, deep breathing or touching it. It does sound like musculoskeletal pain, possibly an inflammation of the cartiledge between the ribs and sternum (breastbone), which is fairly common and the result of some strain that you probably would not remember.  It can be persistent and take some time to heal; it is not dangerous and is treated with antiinflammatories.  Ask your doctor about what you can take, as they can have side effects.  If you are having dizziness and shortness of breath, see your doctor to rule out any respiratory/inner ear problems.  These symptoms can have many causes, including anxiety.\n\n",

    "title": "Is back pain the root of my heart problem?",
    "content": "Hi. My ordeal all started in mid-May when one day I started experiencing a sharp pain in my heart region accompanied with weakness. A few days later I checked into the ER after having another episode. My blood pressure was fine, EKG; fine, and a chest x-ray appeared to be in good standing. Doctor suggested it was a muscle or skeletal spasm,  prescribed me Ibuprofen and I was on my way.    The following week I began experiencing a numbness in the back of my head (inside) accompanied with lightheadedness and numbness in my bottom corner lip, jaw, eyelids. I still had episodes of irregular heartbeat which kept me up at night, although the sharp pain had subsided. I made an appointment and the doc ordered me to do some blood test work. My results came back fine. She then suggested that anxiety was causing these symptoms. I accepted the fact I had anxiety with certain issues in my life, and I vowed to make a change in lifestyle.   The following weeks thereafter I felt better. I still had spells of lightheadedness and the ache in the back of my head, but that was only because I was on the computer for 3-4 hours. It went away as I became more active.   Then, on July 14th, out of the blue, I began experiencing this heavy, dull, pressure in my heart region. My breathing was labored and I felt lethargic. I was shocked. Here I am anxiety free, getting back into exercising and eating healthier than ever, and this comes along. The symptoms remained constant for the next 3 days, on the 4th day I felt a bit of relief as I was finally able to take a deep breath without irritation. The 5th day the same, and here we are on the 6th day (today) and the effects still linger.  I'm 24m, slim, and follow a healthy diet. I have no family history of heart disease either. I do however suffer from poor posture, as I waste many hours on the computer. I've had chronic back pains & aches since my high school days but always dismissed them. I could be in the kitchen cooking and the middle of my back will ache to the point where I need to sit down immediately. I just want to know if this is what is causing the sharp pains, heavy poundings, and pressure in my heart region?  I've read that poor posture can cause organs to shift, thus affecting the heart. Could this be my case?\n\n",

    "content": "Obviously, I cannot rule out something as dangerous as a cardiac cause for your chest pain over the internet, but according to your description this chest pain is probably not secondary to coronary disease.  You may be suffering not only anxiety, but panic as well.  Panic symptoms include pain/tightness in the chest, shortness of breath, dizziness, and pounding, racing heart.   The attacks can be mild to very severe, and there does not have to be a reason for them to occur.  Of course, anxiety can drive them, but you don't need to feel particularly anxious at the time.    A healthy diet and regular exercise will reduce the frequency/severity of these symptoms, as you have seen.  These symptoms are not caused by poor posture.  Talk to your doctor about treatment for these, or see a psychiatrist.  The back pain is very likely from sitting the comuter with poor posture for long periods of time.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 32 yr.old female who has been experiencing a racing pulse, palpitations and chest pain for the past two and a half weeks. A visit to the clinic resulted in a normal EKG, but my bloodwork showed I have mild hyperthyroidism (TSH 0.34)so the dr. put me on 25 mg of Atenolol to help ease the cardiac symptoms before I see the endocrinologist next week. I've been taking the Atenolol for over a week now, and sometimes my heart still races (up 113)while resting. Most of the time it's between 89-98 though since I started atenolol.   I called my dr. who prescribed it and he said I could add a 25 mg pill before bedtime in addition to the 25 mg pill I take upon waking. However, I am hesistant to do this due to the fact that that Atenolol has already lowered my bp to 88/62 with just one 25mg pill. I also continue to have chest pain. It started on just on the left side of my chest, and was usually sharp in nature. Now I can get it on my right side, between my shoulder blades in my back, in the middle of my chest or wherever. Last night I woke up at 2a.m. with pain on the left side of my ribs, kind of right beneath my left breast, towards the side.   I am very worried that something is really wrong with my heart. Do these sound like cardiac pains? They can come and go throughout the day, whether at rest or during activity. I had an echocardiogram which was slightly abnormal in 1998 so they followed up with a MUGA scan which was entirely normal. Any advice or suggestions as whether my pain sounds cardiac in nature would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\n",

Obviously, I cannot rule out something as dangerous as a cardiac cause for your chest pain over the internet, but according to your description this chest pain is probably not secondary to coronary disease.  In most cases, sharp chest pains are not cardiac in nature.   Frequently, the problem is an inflammation of the cartiledge between the ribs and/or sides of the breastbone and happened with some type of strain that you wouldn't remember.  It can take a long time to heal, and is treated with antiinflammatories.  One way to tell if it is musculoskeletal is if you can bring on more pain or reduce it by different positions.   A sore or very tense neck from stress or osteoarthritis can cause shoulder pain as well.  Have you also had a chest x-ray?  Even stress/anxiety can cause chest pain.  Another possibiity is reflux disease (GERD) although it usually doesn't present as back/shoulder pain, but can cause chest pain.   There can be several different causes for chest pain as you see, and it also may be a combination of a couple of these.    Sincerely,  Shannon   You can also have a combination of these.\n\n",

    "content": "It is a good idea to have a stress test, since your symptoms occured with physical exertion. Your cholesterol is high, and you may have other risk factors as well. Overweight and family history are another. If this doesn't happen when you exert yourself at that level when it's not hot, it reduces your chance of it being cardiac.   Many people have an intolerance for heat, and can get shaky and weak, develop a headache and have chest pains and/or SOB. You can help keep yourself a little cooler by soaking a towel with cool water and wearing it around your neck, also make very sure you are well hydrated with water and/or Gatorade.   In case your doctor didn't mention it, and if you haven't had your stress test yet, do not exert yourself until you do.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello I am a healthy 37 year old female with Menier's disease, costrochrondritis left chest wall and now GERD.  I was placed on Protonix 40mg qd.  That has helped my symptoms.  I presented to my doctor 1 year ago with chest pain, pressure and a lump feeling in my throat that went away with eating.  I also had some fluttering feelings in my throat.  I walked out of that appt with the dx of GERD.  I was placed on a 24 hour holter monitor for the flutters and that was normal even though I did not have a flutter for the 24 hour period.  The Protonix seemed to help those.  I recently tried to get off the Protonix and was off for 3 weeks before I got the first flutter feeling in my throat.  I immediately started the Protonix again.  I had been taking the Protonix for 3 weeks again now and for 3 days I had chest pressure/pain that came and went, and with eating most of the time got better, then it would make it's way back.  I do suffer from anxiety and I get concerned I have a heart problem .  I have had EKG's in the past for ER visits for dizziness and anxiety which ended up being the Menier's disease.  I do take a water pill, potassium and diazepam for my Menier's problem.  I called the doctor last week and gave her all my symptoms of the chest pressure, pain and SOB and she told me to continue taking the Protonix and take another form of antacid in between as needed.  Does this sound cardiac???  My blood work is all normal, BP normal, cholesterol normal.   More times than none eating helps with the chest pressure, but I still tend to worry.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "You are most likely experiencing palpitations, very common with anxiety.  They are harmless and happen to everyone at some point.    Of course, no one can diagnose you over the net, ask your doctor if perhaps an event monitor would be in order, since you didn't have any episodes while wearing the Holter.  Meanwhile, here are things you can do to reduce or eliminate them:  Reduce or better yet, cut our caffiene completely - number one offender. No alcohol or tobacco and avoid sugar. Sleep at least 8 hours at night, less can increase anxiety through the day and increase palpitations. Don't skip meals; hunger and overeating can aggravate them also.  Exercise!!!!!  It is the best reducer of anxiety, and will do wonders for you.  Try not to worry!\n\n",

    "content": "I just wanted to thank you for your reply and give you an update on my status.  As you know I have been an emotional wreck regarding my symptoms thinking they were cardiac.  My newest symptoms are some shortness of breath.  I do have asthma (bronchial) and allergy triggered.  I have noticed myself at times feeling a little like I needed to take a deep breath constantly.  I haven't had an asthma problem in years only when I get a severe chest cold.  I went to the doctors on Tuesday and told her all of my symptoms of chest tightness, sob, chest pain, and that lump feeling in my throat, plus my nerves were shot.  She did a thorough exam and listened for a while to my heart, which I know my pulse had to be flying cause I was just worried.  My BP was 124/74 and she assured me my symptoms were not cardiac.  She changed my Protonix to Nexium 40mg q day.  I do have to say just hearing the fact it wasn't cardiac, my symptoms did decrease.  I have not had the flutter feeling in my chest which she told me was probably gas bubbles in my esophagus.  I can say I do hardly ever belch unless I drink a fluid straight down.  She also did order an Upper GI series in which I go this Tuesday and have done.  She did also ask me if I ever have pain in the top portion of my stomach just below the ribs in the middle of the stomach.  I do occasionally get awakened in the middle of the night with pain there a couple of days a week and then it doesn't happend for a week or two.  Most of the time my symptoms are eased with eating in which I have been told that my be an ulcer?????  As far as the shortness of breath, I am not wheezing, just feel the need to take a deep breath.  I am going to chalk that up to the fact I do have asthma, humidity is 72 percent last week and they say this is a bad season due to the fact she listened to me breathe and didn't hear anything.  I feel positive they will probably find GERD or Ulcer with this test, but if it comes back negative, what possible could it be???  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "You may very well have GERD; it's a very common complaint among adults, especially when there is a lot of stress involved.  Stress and anxiety also increase the production of stomach acid, which can back up into the esophagus, causing chest pain or burning, even higher up into the throat causing a lump feeling like you describe.  It is important to treat, if untreated it can erode the lining of the stomach and esophagus.  Nexium is an excellent medication for this, it will reverse any erosion existing, and control the stomach acid production as well.  You mentioned you had costochondritis.  That can take months to heal and some people suffer with it intermittently for years.  It would only cause the positional pain around the breastbone and/or ribs, though and doesn't have the other symptoms you list.  I would also suggest you do something about your anxiety; this is probably where most of your symptoms are coming from and the diazepam doesn't seem to be helping that much.  Talk to your doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Your boyfriend is taking medication to control the high blood pressure, I hope.  If not, it's important that he start.  It would be a very rare occurance for a 31 year old to have coronary artery disease, but early hypertension is a risk factor that needs to be treated.  Palpitations are usually harmless, everyone has them at some time or another.  Stress, caffeine, lack of sleep, lack of water, lack of exercise are key triggers.  If the MRI shows nothing musculoskeletal, then a stress test (treadmill test) and/or an echocardiogram would be a good idea to rule out anything heart related.    Acid reflux disease is very common in adults; it can cause burning, aching or sharp pains in the chest, and is easily treated.  You may want to ask the doctor about trying something over the counter for that.  Anxiety can also cause chest pain and shortness of breath.\n\n",

    "content": "About a month and a half ago I started having a lot of gas with sharp chest pains, then one day I'm sitting at my computer and I have this intense heat come over the right side of my face around my ear and beside my eye. I go to the ER and they did an EKG and ran some blood tests, all of which came back normal. I went to the doctor for my follow up visit that weekend and they ran some more blood tests all of which also came back normal except for my cholesterol which was 241 and my Sed Rate which was 41. They  put me on steroids for 1 weeks. During the first 2 or 3 days I felt great! I have pain in my knees and for those few days my knees didn't hurt I actually could climb my stairs and walk without pain, I was over joyed to the point of tears. Anyway, My chest seems to have this dull ache in the center most of the time maybe slightly to the left near the top of my breast. It does NOT extend to my arms or my neck. I have pain in my neck from time to time but it's the opposite side and I know that's from computer use. I get strange sharp pains in both my arms from time to time but also feel that's from computer use. But the dull ache in my chest bothers me and worries me. I have NO shortness of breath, but seem to get bloated easily nomatter what I eat or how much I eat or little I eat. I'm 36 years old. I do not smoke, never have. I have great blood pressure despite the fact I'm over weight and I do not work, I use my computer a lot so I don't move around as much as I should. I do not drink except on a rare occassion, maybe once every couple months if that much. This dull ache in my chest has me concerned. My doctor knows about it and doesn't seem to be too concerned. He sent me for an MRI but I don't like closed spaces so couldn't do it, not even an open MRI and he just told me watch my symptoms and if the pain beside my head comes back to go to the ER, otherwise he said he'd see me in 3 months. Should I mention the chest pain and go back in sooner or am I being symptomatic? My dad passed away 3 months ago from a massive heart attack and I admit it makes me worry about msyelf. When he first died I ate all the things he did trying to kill myself, but of course have since come to my senses. Should I be worried? The pain does not get worse with exercise although I can't walk as much as I'd like without getting short of breath but usually a few minutes rest and I can keep going. Any help is much appreciated anything to put my mind and my chest at ease. It's not painful, but has become annoying?\n\n",

You could possibly be suffering from GERD (acid reflux disease); it often presents as chest pain, either dull, aching or burning.  Ask your doctor about trying some medication for that.  Also, you may be suffering from anxiety, which can produce the gas, bloating, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and many other symptoms.

I experienced this pain in my collarbone for the first time then.  I was then hospitalised until the situation went under control.  Unfortionately, the doctors did not know what was wrong with me or how to fix my condition, my body just fixed itself.  It has been 3 years since then, and the pain never realy went away, it just showed itself in a barable form.  Basically, the pain is:  - pain in the left collarbone - accelerated heart beat ( i believe due to pain) - throbbing of the heartbeat in the collarbone - \"rotting\" and twisting sensation of the collarbone  It really perturbs me when I feel this pain.  I extremely dislike it especially as it comes and goes infrequently.  Any information on what this may be, or what can be done to prevent this pain would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

I have hypertension (140/90 untreated, 110/65 treated) and take Micardis 80mg once a day. Recently I have been having mild discomfort in the chest, most sensitive between the 4/5/6 ribs on my left side, next to the sternum. In the past I have experienced arrhythmia from about 17 years old, being a non-event until 5 years ago (found during EKG), and now it has returned on occasion. The arrhythmia normally manifests itself in 2 ways, sounding like, beat-beat-beat-bump or beat-bump-beat (normal I would describes as beat-bump, beat-bump, etc.). Episodes can last for several minutes and normally occur when resting. They will correct themselves or I can take a deep breath, touch my toes, and compress my chest and normal rhythm occurs. The arrhythmia does not seem (as far as I am aware) directly to the discomfort. The discomfort may last half a day or just a few minutes, but is never severe or escalating in pain. I do snore and have been tested for sleep apnea but scoped minimal on the test requiring no treatment (advise was to loose weight and exercise).  I have an appointment to see the general doctor and would like feedback to discuss this with him. Any ideas on what my symptoms relate too would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\n",

Please take a moment to check our chest pain page, which lists a differential diagnosis of chest pain causes.   Have they checked him for an AORTIC ANEURYSM? This is caused from a weakness in the wall of the aorta where it comes off the heart, it can be from birth or caused from an injury. Extremely dangerous condition to have, it can rupture and the person could bleed to death in minutes.   Often the ECG results will read normal in an uncomplicated aortic aneurysm and it can be missed. The best tests to begin with for diagnosing would be a Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest.   The symptoms for an high aortic arch aneurysm are light-headedness, weakness, shortness of breath, rapid heart beat, sweating, numbness or tingling in the arm, chest pain or pressure and loss of consciousness (fainting). This is a very dangerous thing to have, especially if he is having discomfort.   Please keep us informed of his condition if you get a moment.\n\n",

In the last month the pressure has become consistent lasting almost all day. Basic symptoms are as follows:  Mild to Moderate Chest Pressure (right in the middle of the chest above the breast bone adn/or left breast) Left arm aches, does not hurt but aches. Sometimes the jaw aches as well Cannot always get a deep breath  I went to the doctor in early June and she thought it was GERD.  She perscribed Protonix and Xanax in case this was caused by Anxiety (I have a high stress job in information technology for a healthsystem) The protonix has not helped. The Xanax helps me sleep but does not alliveate symptoms. It was much worse Sunday night and the aching was radiating to my left ar,  I went to the ER fearing I was having a heart attack. EKG, Chest X-Ray, Lipid Panel, Troponin were all normal. I went back to the doctor yesterday and she continues to say it is GERD and perscribed different meds.   The pressure now lasts all day long in the center of my chest. With my arm, jaw or back aching about 50% of the time.  It does not seem to react based upon what I am eating, it is simply there. Any ideas? I am scared to death this is cardiac but the only risk factors I have are family history and that I am overweight with slighlity high blood pressure.\n\n",

    "content": "Cardiac causes have been ruled out; it could be other things.  I do believe you have an anxiety component to this, even though the Xanax didn't help.  There are many other medicines you can try.  That said, other possible physical problems like TMJ disorder could explain your jaw/ear pain, that is a classic TMJ symptom.  TMJ is inflammation of the joint that connects your upper and lower jaw.  High stress causes some people to grind their teeth at night and/or clench the jaw subconsciously when very stressed or anxious.  This causes pain in the joint, and it can often radiate to the ear.  The neck is another area that anxiety/stress focuses on.  We tend to get tension in the neck, which can eventually cause pain down the arm because the nerves to the arms and upper body originate in the cervical spine.  Chest pressure/pain and/or upper back pain is another classic feature of anxiety, with the feeling of not being able to get a deep breath.  The more these symptoms happen, the more we think about them, and it becomes a cycle.  GERD is also a part of stress and anxiety for many people, since stress causes the stomach to overproduce acid which causes chest pain.    Talk to your doctor about trying something different for the stress/anxiety or better yet, see a psychiatrist, they are much better equipped to effectively treat these things.  Since you have been cleared, you really should start a moderate, regular exercise program.  It relieves stress and anxiety, sometimes to the point you don't need medicine. And since you're already overweight with hypertension and risk factors, it would be a good idea to get fit and lose weight now, rather than waiting for the damage to occur.\n\n",

    "title": "Pain in chest, back and neck",
    "content": "Hello.  I work in a pet store and lift 40lb dog food bags a lot.  Last year I pulled muscles so bad that one side of my back (I can't remember now which one) was raised up about 1\" higher than the other side.  I could not move it was so bad.  About 3 or 4 weeks ago, one morning I had black spots in front of my eyes and did not feel well.  The next day I got a pain in my chest, down my arm and up my neck.  I was scared because my 2 grandmothers and my father have all had heart attacks.  I went to emergency and had an ECG.  They said it was fine.  The pains did not go away.  I went to my doctor the next week and she said I had pulled muscles.  The front of my chest and shoulders are sore when I put pressure on to rub them.   I go to massage therapy and she says that my muscles are really tight.  The problem is she works on me and then I have to go back to lifting dog food again.  My heart pounds, I have pains in the left side of my chest and sometimes the right(though not as often) I have an achy feeling in my back under my arm pit.  I get headaches and sometimes get dizzy.  Would this all be because of pulled muscles?  I think I am also having a little of anxiety attacks because when I have a pain I worry it's my heart because of such a bad family history.  I am 32 and don't drink or smoke and am not overweight.  I'm sorry for such a long post.  This is my first visit.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Chest pain is always worriesome for coronary disease. At young age, it is rare to have coronary disease, but it is not unheard of. Chest pain could also be related to other conditions such as mitral valve prolapse and blood clots going to the lungs among others. I am really glad that the first thing you did was go to your doctor and exclude heart disease, given your family history.   Are you lifting with your legs or your upper body? As long as you continue the same activity, your pain will likely remain. You might rethink what you do for a living; massage is a good therapy, heating pad, packs, and warm soaks in the bath can also relieve some of the pain.   You are right about the anxiety; it can cause chest pain, the pain down your arm is due to tight neck muscles. The chest, neck, shoulder, back and arm pains are actually very common symptoms, even for people who don't lift and can be brought on by anxiety. Talk to your doctor about treating the anxiety and much of the pain will go away, provided you give the muscles a chance to heal.   The chest pain could also possiby be reflux disease, and it's common in very stressed people as well. See your doctor about trying treatment for that along with the anxiety.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 43 year-old and exercise regularly.  It has been 4 years that I participate to mountain bike competions (long rides of more than 100Km).  In the last 4 years I experienced palpitations during training once in a while (probably once in every 6 months).  However lately I had 4 episodes of palpitations during bike rides.  During these episodes I feel like my heart is racing, no other symptoms.  My heart monitor read 200bpm.  When I stop heart beats will go around 140 and after 3-5 minutes sudenly drop to 100.  These palpitations are annoying and interfere with my trainning since I now paid to much attention to them.  I have no heart disease and none in my family, my cholecterol is normal.  ECG during exercise is normal and cardioechography showed everything is normal.   My resting heart rate is between 55-60.  Lately (the last three months) I incresed my trainning sessions to 9-10 hours/week and train at the intensity of 145-165 bpm 25% of the time.  No symptoms everything is perfect.  Can these palpitations be caused by overtraining?  I also take symbicort for animal allergy (ashma), I know it can increase heart-rate but I have not notice it at rest.  Is there anything to to prevent these palpitations and what should I do when I have them?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Did the cardiologist mention trying an event monitor? That could capture the run of tachycardia/palpitations, since it didn't happen on your stress/echo.   If you are not experiencing any increased shortness of breath or dizziness, it is probably benign.   You can possibly reduce them by eliminating caffeine and alcohol altogether if you haven't. Plenty of sleep (8-9 hours) is very important.   You may be overtraining or training with too little carbohydrate intake.   These are some possibilities I can think of.\n\n",

I'm anxious because normally I have lots of energy, running after two children and somedays I feel like I can't get out of bed.  Also, the more I focus on my breathing, the more I anxious I get about it and it seems like I can't get a deep breath.    I have an appt with my GP next friday but would appreciate any thoughts.

Fatigue and SOB are definitely symptoms to be evaluated, and can also be solely from anxiety.  Definitely see your doctor for a complete physical, including thyroid, ECG, chest xray and spirometry (measure of inspiration and exhalation).  He will probably be able to do all of this in his office.   There is really no way to even give you a close diagnosis on the internet, but it really doesn't sound like PPH.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for your response.  I am curious-why do you say it doesn't sound like PPH?  Aren't the hallmarks of PPH fatigue and SOB early on and then other symptoms as it progresses?  Regarding my anemia here is a brief history-two years ago my hemo. and ferritin levels were very low, they gave me iron supplements, i couldn't keep them down so I stopped taking them and tried to treat the anemia through diet, more spinach, beans etc.  I rarely eat meat and haven't eaten red meat since I was a teenager.  Then last year it was checked again and I was still anemic, though not as bad.  Isn't anemia symptomatic only when it's severe?  If I've been borderline anemic for a few years, wouldn't my body compensate for that?  I did learn something-my mother told me when I was 4-5 I was anemic and had to get iron shots for awhile.  I don't know why I was anemic at that age, my current anemia is due to heavy, close together periods (that's what the doctor suspected).  That's why I'm concerned it's something more sinister-I know PPH tends to strike women from 20-40 (I'm 33) and presents with the symptoms I have.  And that it appeared out of the blue, within the last two months I get winded going up stairs, feel dizzy if I stand up too quickly, etc.  The reason I say that is because you notice the SOB with physical exertion, not constantly even at rest, dizziness is the second most common complaint in the doctor's office, and iPPH is very rare.  Your symptoms cover so many other things, dizziness can even be simply from not eating enough, or going too long in between meals.  Of course, that may or may not be the case, it's just an example.  It would be very alarmist to jump to the conclusion of PPH.    I did say if your iron was slightly low, you shouldn't be experiencing these symptoms due to that.  Have you ever had an echocardiogram?  That will measure the pressure and your doctor may do that to rule out any heart involvement.  You will have all sorts of testing to rule out anything serious, of course, but try to relax.  Your anxiety about having a fatal disease is more than likely making your symptoms worse.  There are only 500-1000 cases of PPH diagnosed per year!  It's just very unlikely, relax!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Fran,  SOB can be on exertion, but can also be at rest.  Most complaints about SOB in young people are anxiety related, but it's always important to rule out cardiac and pulmonary causes first.  An echocardiogram measures pressures within the heart, like the pulmonary artery (which is what causes PPH), and gives a live visual of all four sections of the heart and valves in action.  It rules out things like mitral valve prolapse, which is not serious and even fairly common.  It seems to have a connection with anxious people, although it  physical in nature, but the anxiety makes it worse.  Chest pain, palpitations and shortness of breath with worsening anxiety are common features.  You do sound like you get overly anxious about your health.  Perhaps if there is nothing cardiac or pulmonary involved, you could discuss with your doctor something to treat that.\n\n",

    "content": "I've had this problem for a number of years, but it was never frequent enough for me to worry (I remember having it as far back as college 4 years ago, but maybe only happened three times in a year).  Anyway, I won't be doing anything in particular, and I'll get a wave of dizziness. It is usually only if I jerk my head or stand up or sit down. If I remain in one spot and focus on one object, the feeling goes away until I move again. This has happened right after meals as well. Eating does not seem to make the feeling go away.  When I was about 5 years old, I remember having an inner ear infection. I can't recall much about what was done, except I believe they sucked a bunch of junk out of my ear, and then put tubes in. I suppose they eventually just dissolved or something.  While I may have only had these spells three or four times a year, they've been occuring rather frequently in the past couple of months. Last week, I had three spells, and this week I've already had four. They're bad enough where I can't really get much done, and can last anywhere from 20 minutes to 4 hours (that's the longest so far).  I went to a doctor a couple of weeks ago, and he suggested that it might have to do with anxiety. He gave me some pills (buspirone), and I've been taking them as prescribed, but they're not helping.  He did do a quick examination of me when I was there, and didn't see anything evident. He looked in my ear with whatever it is and didn't see anything (although I don't know if you can see into the inner ear with that or not), so I didn't really mention my inner ear infection (from when I was younger). Honestly, I've been in great health my entire life and I'm in pretty good shape (I'm in the military), so this is very upsetting.  I know it's not really a lot to go on, but the only thing I can really think of is that infection from 20 years ago. That's honestly the only other time I've been sick enough to go see a doctor.  Help?\n\n",

On atenolol it stays around 90. It seams my heart tends to \"flip-flop\" when i am stressed, or around loud noises. I have seen 2 cardiologists in the last 15 months. The first told me I was too young to have heart problems but told me my heart rate was too high to be normal and put me on atenolol and sent me on my way. I went to a second doctor to find out why i had to take atenolol. He told me I have a hyper active sympathetic nervous system and sent me on my way with no lehman's explination or further visits. He told me to avoid exercise and never come off atenolol. I take my medication routinely but in the last few weeks I have noticed my problems coming back regardless of the atenolol. I was in a near accident and my heart started beating fast and i fainted. I went to see the car races last weekend and i felt like my heart was going to come out of my chest. I don't know where to turn but I need to know what's going on and find a way to fix this.  Any advice would be helpful. I live in a small town and medical options are limited\n\n",

    "title": "Racing heart",
    "content": "Hello Friend, Yes, your condition can be very scary indeed, esp if they occur w/o notice. I'm sure one of your dr's did an EKG, what did the results come back? Was it just racing heart or was there abnormal heart beats such as PVC's, possible supraventricular tachycardia?  During these episodes, do you experience chest pain, breathlessness, fainting, change of skin color (bluish)?  You must be persistant with your dr. and ask for explainations and complete understanding. Also, as you are doing now, educate yourself. What is your constant resting heart rate. 120 is way too high and will no doubt cause dizziness. If the Atenolol, helps, stay on it, it is a good choice, may even need to up the dose if you are still at 90 beats/min at rest. Have they put you on a Holter monitor? It is a 24 hr recording of your cardiac activity and would a very useful diagnostic tool in your case, esp since you are young and otherwise healthy, yes?  Be sure to decrease your caffeine intake, are you taking weight loss meds or any other cardiac stimulants? If extreme anxiety attacks, may have to consider anti-anxiety meds such as xanax or valium as last option please. If you have an aggressive attack and no help immediately available, you might have to initiate a \"valsalva maneuver\" in order to terminate the attack. This consists of a forcible attempt to breath out while holding your vocal cords tightly together. It is difficult to describe, but this maneuver can occur spontaneously when lifting a heavy object, straining while on the toilet, or at the beginning of a sneeze. It can be deliberately performed by pinching your nose and holding your mouth closed and attempting to blow out against the closed passages as one would if trying to clear their middle eardrums during flight pressure changes. Does this make sense? Basically, you will attempt to override the sympathetic nervous system (fast, fight or flight syndrome) with the parasympathetic nervous system (slows things down temporarily). As far as being to young to have a heart condition, that is nonsense. Anyone can have cardiac abnormalities, it is up to you to find a Dr. or nurse practioner willing to educate you and offer alternatives. You did not have any cardiac defects as a baby did you? Also, I don't agree with you not being able to exercise, so please explore this further. Once again, I am a nurse, so you should go with your dr's final instructions. Hope this helps. Also, you should get a med-alert bracelet to notify others if you are unable. Be well my friend and educate yourself and your family.\n\n",

    "title": "Ongoing chest pain",
    "content": "My troubles started in April after a series of really bad migraines. I was put on 25 mg of Topomax (to work up to 75 mg) for migraine preventative. I had used Topomax before with great success, but this time was different... Really bad anxiety, feeling out of it, slurred speech, etc. This all resulted in an ER visit with chest pain. The day I went to the ER, the chest pain would come and go. It would radiate to my jaw and to my back. The pain would last for anywhere from 45 min. to a few hours.  My heart rate was high (118, I think), but EKG was fine. They gave me fluids, waited for my heart rate to go down, and sent me home. I am 32, so they said not to worry about it, estrogen was my natural protection against a heart attack (even though I am 5'6\" and am morbidly obese- 290?!). So anyway, the next day I see my doctor. My throat was very red, I had sinus drainage, so I was told I had a respitory infection (no fever though). Amoxicillin and Allerga D. I went home and the chest pain still happened daily (mostly at night, with some heart palpitations). I called back in a few days after no change. They said come back in. My throat was still red, Dr. said, wrong antibiotic and gave me Levaquin, 500 mg for ten days. It worked. Chest pain went away. Eleven days later, after finishing meds, the chest pain came back. Dr. called in amoxicillin and went on vacation. The Amoxicillin once agin, did nothing. So I had six days of Levaquin, 750 mg, at home, and I decided to take it. Chest pain left. Now, seven days later, Levaquin is gone, pain is back. Dr is on vacation. This time, my chest pain started in my left arm pit and spread through the left side of my chest and eventually to my shoulder and back. It was awful last night. I am scared to go to sleep (my aunt died in her sleep of a heart attack at age 50, she had a dr appt the next day for chest pain she had been having). Today, chest pain is still there on left side of chest and in my back/shoulder. My neck (not through but on the outside) feels tight and swollen. I have no fever, no cough, no normal symptoms of a respitory illness (I am prone to sinus infections), no congestion. ??? What is this??? and why does Levaquin help? Also, I have had really bad indisgestion at night and swollen ankles, feet. Also,  I feel like something bad is going to happen.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "The Topomax is known for causing the cognitive slowing.   You need to ask for another medication, there are many others in that class that don't cause those symptoms.  Even if you didn't have them before, it can happen, especially with any increase in dose.  Your sinus infections really don't have anything to do with your palpitations, but taking the Allegra D does.  Any kind of decongestant (pseudoephfedrine) is prone to causing palpitations, rapid heart rate and anxiety.  You already had anxiety from the Topomax which makes the chest pain worse. Your increased anxiety more than likely had you so worried about it being heart related it actually \"caused\" the radiating pain. The most likely reason your symptoms went away while on the Levaquin is called placebo effect, that is, if you think it will help, it does.  Since you thought the amoxicillin/penicillin (same thing) was the culprit, you trusted the Levaquin, therefore reducing your anxiety and symptoms.  Antibiotics do not cause or eliminate palpitations, anxiety or chest pains.   By the way how many days after the Levaquin were you taking the Sudafed?  Shortly after you ran out of Levaquin, your symptoms came back, and the anxiety that drives it came back also, making it worse.  Do you see the correlation?  Ask your doctor to give you something for your anxiety and just see if the symptoms go away.  I don't mean to sound like I am saying this is \"all in your head\", I believe you had these symptoms, but after 10 years in Cardiology and Internal Medicine I have seen a huge number of these cases, mostly in young people at risk for heart disease.    Do not rely on estrogen protecting you heart - the latest studies are suggesting more and more that it actually may increase your risk.  You already have family history of heart disease.  Why don't you start eating a healthy, smaller portioned diet and get clearance from your doctor to start a light excercise regimen.  It will reduce depression and anxiety, not to mention everything else it does.  That will protect your heart for sure.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a significant amount of acid reflux shown in my upper gi barium test, thus I have GERD according to my Dr. This is causing the gland on the right side of my neck to be reactive, thus the neck pain. GERD is also aggravating my ears, nose, and throat, thus giving me the ongoing sinuitis. I do not have a sour taste in my mouth, or belching, or any of the other symptons of GERD, just the chest pain, and neck and sinus thing. I do think  that Topomax may have brought this on. I had to take a zantac everytime I took a topamax because of the heartburn it caused while I was on it. I still have more tests, as I still have unexplained hair loss, edema, and now a rash on my fingers.  But, my heart is great. My blood pressure is 120/80 or below. I aced the stress test. My cholesterol is good, 170. My bad/good cholesterol ratios are good. My triglycerides are good. My multiple EKG's were all normal. And I have lost 20 lbs. since my last post. But, it was not anxiety and it was not my heart.\n\n",

    "content": "I hope you can advise me,  I am a 28 year old mother of two.  I am 5'9\" and weigh 156 lb.  I have no significant health issues. I have been experiencing intermittent mild chest pains for months now, which I have put down to anxiety and tried to ignore.  They feel like a needle or a sharp pinching sensation, quite painful but extremely brief.  They don't seem to be related to breathing, exercise, times of stress or anything else so far as I can tell.  They are always on the left side.  I have also coughed up blood-stained sputum on occasion but have attributed this to the fact that I smoke and tried not to worry about it.  Lately I have been noticing the little pains more and a generally uncomfortable sensation in my chest.  I've also been feeling woozy and dizzy when I stand up and having a ringing in my ears at least three times a day.  Usually I would put it all down to anxiety, which I have a history of, but two days ago my mother collapsed with a pulmonary embolism and we found out she has familial hyperlipidaemia.  I am now really frightened and have no idea whether my symptoms could mean something sinister or not.  My doctor has got used to dismissing me with reassurances because of my anxiety, and I'm worried that if there is something really wrong he will miss it!\n\n",

    "title": "Chest pain, discoloration, and lump under armpit",
    "content": "Hello,  I'm really concerned about my younger 15 year old brother. I would really appreciate a quick response! We're going to the doctor tomorrow but have very limited resources (little money, no health insurance)  so we would like to have as much direction and insight as possible before pursuing different doctors.  Two years ago when my brother was thirteen he started to have a dark discoloration over his right chest, pretty much overnight. I can't remember if it was all above the nipple or not but right now it's a little past his nipple. It has gradually gotten larger, partly because his skin is expanding as he grows bigger. I think it's generally spreading a bit to his right side. He is Asian and has light, sometimes tan skin, and the discoloration has always been darker brown. He says his skin is hairier where the discoloration is, and it feels a bit scaly like dry skin  even though actual scales don't come off.   My brother has had chest pain three times in the past several months. First time this past March, then a month and a half later, then just a few days ago. It lasts up to 2 days. The first and last time, it was his right chest, the second time, his left chest. He describes it as a sharp pain that involves his chest and his side (i.e. right chest and right side, or left chest and left side). It hurts most when he inhales, shifts his body when laying down, and goes down the stairs. The pain was bad enough that it woke him up from sleep once.  Just today, my brother found a lump under his right armpit. It feels like a round bulb, maybe about 1 cm in diameter (not quite sure). I've tried to determine if the lump moves when I touch it, but it was too hard to say. My brother says that it hurts a bit when you push at the lump.   The only other things I can think of to say is that he has been exercising a lot outside lately, and also that about two weeks ago he had a pretty bad cold, but he is all better now. He is 5'11\" and I think about 130lbs (underweight in my opinion).  I know that the questions regarding the discoloration and lump are not typical of this specific forum, but I was wondering if there was a connection between where the discoloration and lump is located (right chest, right armpit) relative to his chest (at least for the first and third times he has experienced right chest/right side pains).   Can you please give us your opinion on what you think his symptoms mean? On what illnesses or conditions he may have?  Thank you so very much, this means a lot!\n\n",

Get up slowly from a lying down position, and be very aware of your suroundings while you're walking around so that you don't trip and fall during any dizzy spell that may occur.

    "title": "Chest and back pain, almost constant for months.",
    "content": "I've been having some chest pains and problems for about eight or nine months now and me (and apparently my doctor) are having problems trying to figure out what is going on.  Early November 2004 I was visiting a friend's house playing cards and the entire evening I felt sweaty and my pulse was around 120.  For the next 2 or 3 weeks I had a continual burning pain in my chest.  I thought this might be related to acid reflux or some kind of stomach problems as I'd heard that can cause these symptoms, so I got some antacid, but that didn't seem to help.  After about 3 weeks the chest pain went away on it's own.  But then I started having abdominal pain.  The pain got progressively worse and I visited the doctor.  They prescribed Protomix 40MG for acid, thinking my chest pain and adbominal pain were GERD.  This seemed to do nothing.  I had an upper GI done and the doctor said that my esophogus looked clean as a whistle, but I had some gastritis in my stomach.  They took a biopsy and determined that it wasn't caused by any kind of a bacterium, so they doubled my Protonix medication.  This still hasn't seemed to resolve my symptoms.  Sometime in late January my chest pain returned, at times diffuse, at times very focused just left of the middle of my chest.  The pain also seems to radiate to my left shoulder and just left of the middle of my upper back.  I also began experiencing dizzy spells and began to feel fatigued.  Then while attending a training in the clinic where I work, I suddenly felt a pressure in my chest and a feeling like all of the blood had rushed from my head.  My head began to swim and I got very shaky.  I had to excuse myself and went upstairs to Urgent Care.  They took one look at me and got me in immediately, and then rushed me over to the ER.  I had started to feel a bit better by this time, though my heart was racing at about 160 BPM.  I spent a night in the hospital hooked to an EKG and had blood thinners and nitroglycerine hooked up.  The resting EKG was normal the whole time.  They took blood samples and everything was normal with those, and they indicated that I had suffered no heart damage.  They did a stress test the next day but that turned up normal.  So they sent me home saying that it wasn't cardiac related.  After that I had trouble falling asleep and getting comfortable, so the doctor prescribed me Clonazepam 1MG, 3 times a day and that helped me to relax and helped my fatigue, and even seemed to help my chest pain a bit, but it never went away.  The chest pain's been a constant presence since this time.  I continue to take the Clonazepam.  I think my previous episode was a panic attack due to the chest pain.  The Clonazepam has helped me not to have any more of these.  But, the chest pain still worries me.  Sometimes it's worse, and sometimes it feels a little better.  It's always a dull gnawing ache, occasionally punctuated by very short stabbing pains that seem as though they may be associated with changes in position, though it's not consisten.  I'm 31 years old, 6 foot 3 inches tall, and weigh about 265.  I used to weigh around 340 but have worked on dropping my weight over the last couple of years.   I don't have a history of cardiac disease in my family.  My BP is pretty consistently around 120/80.  In my blood tests my cholesterol was fine except my \"good cholesterol\" was a bit low.  My father's side of the family does have a history of osteoperosis.  My father is quite bent over at age 68 and my back has been started to ben over as well.  Since the pain in my back always accompanies my chest and arm pain I'm not sure if this can cause these sort of symptoms.  I exercise about an hour a day and always feel better after I'm done.  My mind, especially in the morning feels like it's \"in a fog\" and I still get some light-headedness, fatigue, and  dizzyness.  I'd like to figure out what this is.  I don't like taking the Conazepam because I know that it's addictive and not particularly good for me, but if I go off it I get so uptight about the chest pain that I get more anxiety attacks and get so fatigued that I can barely function.  My doctor seems to largely be at a loss as to what's going on.  There are times when I feel very fatigued and like I can't concentrate, making it hard to do my job. It almost seems on these occasionas that standing up and walking around makes my chest pain a bit less, but my dizzyness worse, and vice versa.   In addition I still have some pretty severe pain from my gastritis and sometime it feels like my guts are twisting into knots.  I know that this is long-winded and pretty rambling, but I'd really appreciate some fresh insight into this as this is really affecting my quality of life.\n\n",

You may have also had a mild injury to the cartiledge between your ribs and either side of the breastbone, called costochondritis.  This can happen with excercise, especially lifting weights and the pain is affected by certain positions .  Ask your doctor if he thinks trying an antiinflamatory might help.  You may do better on an antidepressant with as needed Klonopin, they are not addicting, because they are not narcotics like Klonopin, and there is usually a depression component with anxiety.  Since you have had extensive testing, you may want to see a psychiatrist who is better equiped to treat all of your symptoms effectively.\n\n",

    "title": "Pains in my chest  or is it  all in my head?",
    "content": "Hi I am a 23 yr old female. I have been having pains in my chest now for almost 7 months. Im told it is anxiety but honestly my life is pretty calm. I am being treated with an anxiety medicine doxepin. As a result all i seem to get from it is feeling hung over in the mornings and terrible headacches. The pain is odd i have expeirenced an anxiety attack before where i was in a custody battle. i presume normal circumstances under the situation. Though it seems now the pain is almost constint in my left chest at the top of my breast in the begining of my armpit. My heart rate is never lower than 110 any time i go to the doc. The only thing my doctor has done is run an ekg and labs. In which everything came out basically normal. showed my cholestoral was slightly elevated. I am recently overweight slightly and my bp has recently been running high ex 144/94. as well as severe headaches are new. I'm generally healthy i excersise daily walk 1 to 3 miles every evening and spend all day chasing my 3 yr old. It is a very scary feeling not knowing what is wrong. My doctor says im fine. Though honestly i don't feel fine. Heart disease runs high in my family. My mother at 45 has already had a quad bypass 6 stints placed as well as other procedures done. There at a point of asking what they can do next. My father has angina. Am i at risk? or am i just paranoid. Im at a point where i don't no where else to turn my doc wants to treat chest pain with physchiatric drugs i don't feel mentally unstable never been to a physc. a day in my life. So when i do go to the doc in regards to it i feel like i belong in a nut house because i just cant stop thinking something isnt right because my body says something is wrong?  Please help!\n\n",

    "content": "Anxiety can indeed cause these symptoms, and is very likely your problem.   When your blood pressure is high at the  doctor's office, they keep checking it a few times before you leave, don't they?  What does it go down to the last time they check normally?  Blood pressure and heart rate are notoriously high at the doctor's office; especially in patients who already have anxieties about their health.  Yes, you are definitely an at risk individual for coronary disease given your family history and elevated cholesterol at such a young age, but you are really too young to already have accumulated plaque in your arteries sufficient to cause all these problems; racing heart isn't due to coronary disease.  It would be a very good idea to lose all the excess weight now; it's much easier to keep it off than to take it off, and also eat a healthy low fat/cholesterol diet.    Have you had a holter monitor done?  An echocardiogram?  It might be worth talking to your doctor about having these tests, just to rule out any other problems.  If they are fine, and your doctor can't find any other problems, you really ought to consider seeing a psychiatrist; it doesn't mean you're crazy.  If it will help, why not try?\n\n",

Though I go through an army hospital where you need referals for everything i have asked my doctor to put a referal in so i am waiting for it. no the doctors never check my blood pressure before i leave. Just the one time of being checked in to be seen. Though the nurse always comments on it being high. I have had an ekg. It is normal. thats the only test in which has been ran. I suppose maybe i am a little nervous because my mothers always came out normal as well. They found nothing until they did a heart cath. No one not even the doctors expected to find what they did. I no i am still young. I am aware, very aware of the symptoms of anxiety. I suppose the only reason i ask is because i have had this pain with no other sighns or symptoms of anxiety. I am trying my best to diet and loose the weight now while i am young due to the fact of increase risks to my health. It is a struggle im not to sure which route to go i excersise daily. not sure which diet would be best though. thanks for the help\n\n",

    "content": "Hello all.  I am a 24 yr male, 6'3 and slender.  Every now and then I get fatigued.  I had mono like 2-3 years ago.  After that it was downhill.  My symptoms:  I get anxious and sometimes pain in my legs like I need to strech them.  My upper left chest hurts and my left arm...while it even feels less sensative than my othe arm or tingley.  My left jaw hurts too and I get light headaches often.  My upper left side of my back hurts too and generally feels better to rub it or move my arm and chest around to get it to leave, but will generally stay the rest of the day.  The center of my chest or sternum gets tight too and if I arch back I can crack it or pop it.  Weird?  Also my lower back hurts every now and then, rubbing it helps a bit.  I feel like I need to burp when I hurt and I have heart burn when I wake up just  about everyday.  Drinking a bunch of water helps some.  Every now and then 1-3 times a week I have palpatations too or what ever it is when your breath catches and it pushes air out (like a cough).  My BP flux around 132/73 to at the doctors 151/83.  I've had a stress test/echo and everything was good, but my BP took a while to go down.  Have NOT gotten my cholestrol checked.  Why the pain, the fatigue, the palpatations, the anxiety.  Oh and the anxiety seems to go down the more active I am.  My chest gets tight when I run...like I need to pop it.  Thanks for you help.  I sit at a computer like 10hrs a day... I do catch myself leaning forward and holding my self up with my elbows alot.  ALWAYS when I get up from my chair and walk, my body and chest pulses pretty hard for a minute or so.  I usually have a conciousness of my pulse which i feel sitting and lying down (kina like when you pull an all nighter, your body pulses a bit).  I always catch my self with a tight stomach too.  I run a few times a week and eat generally heathy...if I remember to:)\n\n",

    "content": "Have you also had a blood/urine workup and general physical?  Since you have been cleared for cardiac involvement, are you eating enough?  If you don't eat every few hours, your blood glucose can become low and cause fatigue/headaches, and the pounding in your heart when you get up.  It will go even lower a couple of hours after you eat sugar or carb-only snacks or meals.  Sitting at computers for that long every day is definitely not healthy for your neck and back or your eyes (which can cause the headache too).  You get stiff when sitting for that long.  Anxiety is causing your stomach tightness and you may be clenching your teeth and not be aware of it.  Anxiety and stress cause us to tighten the whole body for long periods of time, causing various aches and pains in the chest, arms, neck, back, stomach and myriads of other complaints and can cause all the symptoms you describe, including heartburn and palpitations.  Make sure you get up every 30 minutes or so to walk around, breathe deeply and stretch.  If you start to feel very anxious or stressed, leave your work area for a few minutes.  You are correct about excercise; it lowers stress/anxiety and depression considerably.  Try to get on a schedule of daily aerobic excercise to help with this.   Avoid sugar, caffeine, alcohol and tobacco, as these all contribute to the problem.   Very importantly, make sure you get 8-9 hours of sleep every night and at the same time.  Lack of sleep makes the situation much worse, even if you think you don't need the sleep, do it for a week and see if you don't feel much improved, more alert, less anxious.  You may also want to discuss treating this with some medication.\n\n",

    "content": "Ok , I have ready all the posts and still feel the need to post.  Im 31 male 5 6\" 190lbs non smoker. My grandparents did not halve heart problems.I was a very heavy whiskey drinker from 19-25 ....every other day a 60ounce. I have drank beer since then, but not as often.......1 time a week but very heavy with shooters usually. I have been taking triazolam to goto bed for around 4yrs (.25mg) and recently for last 5months .50mgs.   I am pretty sure I have sleep apnea( im waiting for the sleep study appointment), my g/f says i quit breathing and snore lots while sleeping and I have daytime fatigue no matter how much sleep.  I quit drinking 2 months ago and started eating better(fruits,vegatables,chicken) and bike riding and a little bit of exericise at the gym. I was very unactive before this.  I have not worked for years and have had no stress in the last few months.  I was sent to e/r 2-3wks back for chesht tightness with hard time catching my breath. They did ecg,blood, and chest xray with everything coming back fine.   I talked with friends and they said it may be anxiety and I took a 1mg ativan and my pains seemed to go away or if i take triazolam at night.  My chest constantly has a pressure on the left side and sometimes I have discomfort on my lower left side by my stomach. My left hand is usually tingly as well.  I have only taken the ativan a couple of times when it get really bad because I know how addictive they can be and the last few times have only taken .5mg. My appetite has seemed to diminish as well( i have lost  10lbs in 2wks). I used to eat severeal times a day and now I just drink water and eat 2 small meals a day.  When I do cardio it seems to get better after around 10-15minutes , but an hour or so later just comes back. The pain in my chest has not gone away in 2-3weeks. Like a heaviness.  This is getting to the point where I don't want to leave the house or I try to find a comfortable position  on the couch that helps it out a little bit.  I told my doctor about what my friends said and he really didnt do much , but take my word for it and prescribe me effoxor for stress. I told him the next day I didnt like it and he then prescribed celexa. I took 10mg of that for 2 days , but it makes me sick and dizzy.  I don't think its anxiety, I live on acreage with no stress and don't have a stressfule job( im living off savings). I don't want to start taking these anti depressent because I see the affects and how addictive they are.  I was maybe thinking it could be withdrawal from the triazolams ive been taking for yrs and i have reached my tolerance.  I don't know what the hell to think anymore, I just want this pain off my chest.\n\n",

You say you may be havng withdrawl from the triazolam; did you stop it \"cold turkey\"?  Or did you start taking the ativan instead?  If the latter, you are probably not having withdrawl, the ativan is in the same family (benzodiazepines) and works the same way.  Please give the medicine time; it is very effective once your body gets used to it.  The\n\n",

I was surprised at how many people I know that are taking them. One friend says that if he does not have his pills by noon he starts getting dizzy and has brain zaps.  I have read nothing good about it. They are all just horror stories.  I have no stress in my life , especially when this started. I am very passive and don't get worked up easily. I just don't want to start a medication for something that I really should not have (anxiety or depression).   I forgot to mention that I was taking valium(recreational...stupid i know now) at 10-20mg at night for a while as well and then usually my triazolams.  Would it hurt to do a taper? I was thinking that if it is tolerance -withdrawal, that if I do a valium taper it could not hurt.  I would just go from 10mg a day down to zero. Since it treats anxiety anyway and helps my symptoms and has a longer half life then the other 2 drugs I am using.\n\n",

    "content": "Aloha,  For several years now I randomly feel a sharp pain behind my ear or ears (seemingly following the jugular vein) with a sharp pain in the chest (usually on the out side of one or both sides of the sternum).  The pain at the neck varies from feeling like I'm being garroted to having an ice pick stabbed into my ear to a sharp but bearable pain.  The chest pain is bearable, but disconcerting.  I've noticed that if I concentrate on taking deep breaths and apply warm pressure to my neck, I can alleviate the pain.  At 42 years of age, I have no history of hypertension, don't smoke, don't drink, eat well, and am in excellent aerobic and anaerobic shape.  I am a 6'-3\" male who sometimes has what I perceive to be circulation problems:  feet (especially) and fingers seem to feel inordinately cool.  Over the years, I have been to an ENT, internist, and cardiologist with no diagnosis.  I assume that I'm OK, but I can't help wondering if something is significantly amiss.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Sincerely, KDP\n\n",

They are real, they are not in your head, but they are not from any disease.  The fact that they are relieved by deep breathing and heat relaxing is a good indicator that stress is the problem.  Cold hands and feet are another sign of stress; the blood travels more toward the center of your body.

    "title": "Missed beats, racing heart, now chest pains",
    "content": "Thanks in advance for any help.  I am 42, female, overweight but otherwise healthy. Over the last few months have been experiencing missed beatswhich can go on for a few days and then nothing for a while and two weeks ago was woken by a very fast heart beat and a feeling of breathlessness. I had no pain,but was absolutely terrifed. By the time my husband got me to the er my heart rate was normal, ecg showed normal as did the blood tests. They have checked my thyroid too which is also normal. For the last couple of days i have also been getting unusual pains in my chest on the left side. This is not related to anything as far as i know - it wakes me up at night,also when out walking the dog anytime reallly. I was told at er that unless the ecg could be taken when my heart was racing they could not tell me what type of svt i have. Please help with any info as things are definately getting worse, i don't suffer with anxiety,and am not usually stressed. Also i have never smoked and drink little alcohol. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Weird chest pain and shortness of breath",
    "content": "Hello, i am a healthy 21 y/o female with no history of any health problems beside the fact that i do have anxiety.  physically i have never had anything wrong.  i am currently pregnant and have one child, but my problem started after my son was born and before i got pregnant with this child.  one day i just coughed and got this stabbing pain in the left side of chest near the breast bone.  it was sudden and sharp and shocking and it really scared me.  now i don't have it happen too often, but it does occasionally occur when i am least expecting it.  recently i have been feeling short of breath like i can't get enough oxygen to my diaphram.  i feel the urge to yawn and when i try it's like i can't get the air in.  although i can breath and don't feel dizzy or lightheaded.  i feel like it is the left side of my chest.  in the past i have had ekg's and chest x-rays and been tested for asthma.  it sounds weird but the left side of my chest just feels funny.  when i used to lay down at night on that side i would get a slight numbness sometimes.  i don't know if it is my anxiety, but i honestly haven't had any anxiety previously until i started worrying about my health which was brought on when i coughed that day and had that sharp pain.  now every time i cough i hold my chest in that spot.  another thing i have been expierincing is a heartburn like pain particularly in the left side of my chest in the same vicinity, and it comes on for no reason. even when i just wake up in the morning and haven't eaten yet.  it dosen't go up my neck.  sometimes it goes to the other side, but usually stays there.  today earlier when i was breathing deep i got chest pain on the left side near my breast bone area.  i am really worried about my health, and want to know what could be wrong with me and what steps i should take.  i would appreciate any help that anyone has.\n\n",

    "content": "You have been cleared for heart and lung problems, right?  You may have costochondritis, which is inflammation of the cartiledge within the ribs and is often felt on either side of the breastbone, especially when you breathe really deep.  It can be from heavy and/or frequent coughing, or lifting something heavy, any number of things that you probably wouldn't have noticed at the time.  Try taking advil or aspirin or tylenol, whatever your doctor says you can take, preferably advil (ibuprofen) to reduce the inflammation and the pain.  If these work, it's musculoskeletal, which is more than likely your problem.  Pregnancy and stress/anxiety or both can cause or aggravate indigestion.  You can have it even when you haven't eaten.  Ask your doctor what you can take for this, and try to relax!  Congratulations on your pregnancy.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you in advance for your reply... I am very concerned about this and have an appointment to see my Doctor of Internal Medicine in about 2 weeks (soonest I could get in).  The last few days, I have had tightness/pain in my left chest, neck, shoulder and sometimes my arm & what I can only describe as pulpatations in my chest (I can visually see my heart beat below my rib cage).  My resting heartrate has normally been 60-65 during the day is now in the mid 70s.  I have also experienced pains in my sides & heartburn... though this could be related to the stress I feel about the chest pain.  I am 32 years old and have recently got in pretty decent shape... running & working out 5 days a week.  I just had a fitness assessment at my gym... my stress test went very well.... bp wa 117/72 and they said I was in good health.  Now... though my HR seems normal when I workout (between 150-165) I am hesitant to continue running.  Finally... I do have a colon ulcer that bleeds.  But I take vitamins & ferrus sulfate.  I had a blood test just a month ago that said my hemoglobin count was normal.  So, I don't THINK anemia is related.  I can't imagine what could be happening, but it is definitely scaring me.

With regards to your chest pain, did this occur after you usually do strenous activities or not? does the pain subside whenever you take a rest or not? is the pain also associated with food intake or not?  From what you have mentioned in your message, you are basically fit and had no previous illness except for a colon ulcer. May i ask if you already had your lipid profile checked (to see if your cholesterol levels are with in normal range or not) and also an electrocardiograph to know whether your heart is in good shape too. With these questions, your doctor will be able to distinguish whether the symptom you feel is of cardiac origin or not. And from there, proper management will be given.     Sincerely, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your reply....  I will try to answer your questions the best I can.....  The pain I am feeling is in my left-upper chest & shoulder the most... sometimes lower back or arm (also left side).   I haven't really determined anything specific that causes it... it mostly seems random to me.    Actually, the last week I have gone running and while I run I don't feel the pain at all... it usually doesn't return until at least 15 minutes after my run or cross training.   But my last week of running has been really bad...  I haven't been able to run the distances I normally had been running.   My 4.5 mile run only lasted 3 miles... my 6 mile run ended at 5 (and I also had to walk 3 times which isn't normal).  With regard to food intake... again, I haven't noticed a consistant connection.  I have had some stomach discomfort in general lately...  I don't have \"gas\" but I feel the urge to burp alot.  When I was running on Sunday, I felt some pain in my stomach region that also caused me to take a walking break... though it may have just been a \"stitch\".  I have not had my lipids/cholestorol checked....  at 32 I've never been very concerned.  But, I have scheduled blood tests along with my physical  (stuff I need to fast for 12 hours for) so I am assuming those will be included in my workup.   But with my resting heartrate & blood pressure in good shape, wouldn't it be unusualy to have high cholosterol?  I had an EKG back in 2001 when I had anemia from my ulcer.  It was normal then... haven't had one since.  If the doctors suggests it, I definitely will.  My biggest concern is how I felt relatively good & even happen to have a fitness assessment with great numbers.... and suddenly am having all these symtoms.  I'm going to continue to try & run this week and see if the fatigue factor continues.  Thanks again!  James\n\n",

    "content": "I have been getting chest pains now for about 4 months, sometimes very sharp and painful sometimes just a dull ache. It can radiate into my arms and back usually on the left side, it also seems to be difficult breathing at times as my chest feels constricted.   I am 25yrs old (male)  and have no history of any other medical problems, my family has no history of heart problems.   I have had ECG tests and an Echocardiogram and nothing has shown up.  The problem seems to get worse if i do any sort of exercise (even walking up stairs quickly), or if i smoke or drink coffee.  I initially thought it was a reaction to taking amphetamines (very occasionally) so i completely cut that out and started on a very healthy diet, but still no progress.  It can sometimes happen at rest also and i can constantly feel my heart beating in my chest, which is why i initially thought it was heart-related.. I have seen a few things about costochronditis and think maybe this is what it could be? None of the doctors i have seen have ever mentioned costochronditis and seem to have no idea what it could be and have not diagnosed anything for the pain, could it be related to the lungs or anything else?\n\n",

    "content": "Costrochondritis is an inflammation of the cartiledge within the ribs usually caused by some type of injury.  It does produce the symptoms you describe, getting worse with physical exertion and with pressure applied to the ribs/sides of breastbone.  It is not dangerous - it may linger, though.  Try taking 200-400 mg ibuprofen twice a day, you should get some relief in a couple of days.  Antiinflammatories are not pain pills, they reduce pain by reducing inflammation, so it probably won't give you much relief the first day or two.   You need to keep taking it on a regular basis, as it is accumulative.  Obviously, I cannot rule out something as dangerous as a cardiac cause for your chest pain over the internet, but according to your description this chest pain is probably not secondary to coronary disease. Your heart pounding is more than likely from worrying/anxiety, very common complaint.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 35 year old male, who has suffered from anxiety attacks over 20 years. I also have episodes of left arm pain from a possible injury about 10 years ago. When I have attacks, my arm usually starts to feel pain and feels fatigued, which usually resides shortly after I come down from my attacks.  However, lately the pain now goes from the center of my chest, into my shoulder and down my arm.  This is now prevalent even when I'm not stressing out since I am taking an anti-depressant. Physical activity helps, as well as Advil. The pain and discomfort is worst when I am at rest especially when I am sitting still. It does not interfere with my sleep. There is no pattern, it just comes and goes throughout the day. I have high cholesterol and am slight anemia and a family history of heart disease on both sides of the family. I will be visiting my doctor about this issue, but I have just started a new job and have to wait a month until my insurance kicks in. I know there are a million things it could be, but I'm one of those who thinks of the worst possible outcome. I'm just curious what might be in store for me. Thanks\n\n",

It doesn't sound serious, because of the chronic nature, and it would be worse with activity, and you don't complain of shortness of breath, which would be marked during physical exertion.    Since you do have a history on both sides, you are at very high risk for heart disease yourself, although it is rare to have developed serious coronary disease at your age.  Even though your panic attacks have abated, you are probably still having low level anxiety, and the more you think about these symptoms, the more likely they are to happen, even if there is nothing found with testing.

    "title": "Lightheaded - Anxiety, or am I being discriminated against?",
    "content": "For about a week now I have been feeling lightheaded (Bending over quickly or moving makes it feel like I continue to move for bit before stopping, doesn't feel like everything is spinning. Sometimes I might lean to one side or stumble but not usually) 24/7 so I went to my doctor today since I had heart palpitations and went through 3 ECG's, 2 Blood Tests, Chest X-ray and physical examination. She checked my ears, nose, throat and took my blood pressure which was 160/100 even though I have lost weight, been exercising everyday, and eating much better (Less meat lots of veggies and grains less sugar and fat).  I told her about how I tend to get worked up about things, doom and gloom, and about how my dad has Chronic Anxiety Disorder. She perscribed Fluoxetine which is a generic Prozac thing for Anti-depressant which works on anxiety appearently. But I am wondering if might lightheadedness could be really caused by Anxiety? It's pretty much all the time, sort of feels like I continue moving for a bit after I stop.   I am obese and up until 2 months ago I was eating very poorly, and pretty much just laying around, and my grandfather died when he was 37 even though he was on the force and not really that overweight. (Though he's the only one who appreantly has died that young in his family the rest lived to their mid 60's - 80's).   And when I asked why it was unlikely that I had any type of heart problems, she told me that not many 20 year olds die of heart disease! Is that an okay position to take? It seems like they aren't worried simply because I am young, is it really that unlikely for me to have heart disease? (Including the fact that I have had 2 Blood Tests, 3 ECG's, Chest X-ray all came back negative).  3 different doctors have said this, and the doctor that was supposed to give me a stress test didn't give me one. After giving me an ECG and taking my blood pressure personally he told me that I was fine just that I had to work on losing weight and exercising.   And why am I not being put on any medication for high blood pressure? 160/100 seems pretty high, though when I went to my doctor of internal medicine he read it at 130/80 and when I was at the hospital when they last took my pressure it was also 130/80. Can anxiety spike your blood pressure enough to give such a high reading, I'll admit when I got my blood pressure taken today I kind of got a sickly feeling and suddenly started worrying about it being high though I didn't really notice my heart rate go up.   Is this just my anxiety working me up, is the chance of there being nothing wrong with me be so low that 3 doctors decided that I don't need any further diagnostics and that losing weight, exercise, better diet, and some anti-depressants are what I need?  This is the link to my episode of when I was having palpitations if you are curious to what symptoms other than being lightheaded and is a bit more detailed.  Click here!  I should also mention that my grandfather had scarelt fever as a child before the introduction of antibiotics and upon researching I found that untreated scarlet fever tended to become rheumatic fever and cause heart damage, just curious incase that might explain when he had a heart attack at such a young age while the rest of his family seemed fine. He's arteries were closed to the size of a pencial tip acordding to the doctor, and according to my grandma he was taking diet pills which contained speed.\n\n",

    "content": "You have had a thorough work up for heart disease, it is very uncommon (but not unheard of) for someone at 20 to have coronary disease, blockages develop over many years.  Your lightheadedness is probably due to the Prozac, it's common to have those effects while you get adjusted to it.  Your palpitations are nothing to worry about, everyone has these at some point, they are harmless, but can be very bothersome.  Your blood pressure is fine; yes, it can spike when you are very nervous and anxious.  Rhuematic fever does indeed damage the heart, but has no bearing on your case.  Just take care of yourself, continue on the new path (congrats, by the way!).  Avoid sugar, alcohol, caffeine and tobacco - these make anxiety and palps much worse.  Sleep 8 hours per night and on a schedule and try to avoid as much stress as possible; you will be fine.\n\n",

The Prozac was an option my Doctor gave me in reply to my Lightheadedness and talk about anxiety. She said something about how I am likely to be breathing improperly while not knowing it and causing the light headedness, and that I could take the medication or simply choose to ignore it. Beyond that she didn't think there was anything wrong, though I did manage to persuade her to give me a Lipid panel, Fasting Glucose, and C-Reactive Protien test.   One of the others reasons she gave me the perscription is that appearently one of the side effects of Prozac was that it lowered appetite and she said it could help me lose weight.\n\n",

    "content": "There are always side effects to every medication you take; that doesn't mean you will necessarily experience all of them.  You will probably have an adjustment period, since antidepressants alter certain chemicals in your brain.  However, that's exactly what they are for; and they do work wonderfully in most cases, if you just get through the period of getting used to it.  These side effects usually go away after a week or two, maybe less, it just depends upon the individual.  It also takes 2-4 weeks to become fully effective.  Unfortunately, many people discontinue the medication before it has a chance to work and be free of the bothersome side effects.    And yes, it can lower appetite, again, not in every person.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 34 year old male, non smoker, rarely drink.    Here's a quick run down of when I noticed the palpitations for the first time, maybe this will help.   I have the ones that feel like my heart skips a beat.  1)  Went to doctor several months ago and my BP was elevated at the time, 150/100 (although I think some of that is anxiety about my BP being high).  The doctor gave me Lotrel 5/10.  Which I took for about 5 days this is the first time I noticed the palpitations, so I immediately got off the BP meds.   At this point I was very unhealthy, I ate alot of fast food junk, alot of caffeine, and got no exercise. 2)  I don't feel like I am worried or stressed, but I recently started a new job, leaving my job I had been at for 7 years. 3)  After finding my BP was 150/100, I started exercising and eating better.  I cut out all added salt to foods, as well as caffeine. 4)  The first bout of palpitations I had lasted for a few days, I would feel them maybe 5-10 times a day.  5)  Then they went away, I didn't feel much at all for about a week, then they started again.   6)  Went to doctor for it, they did blood test and EKG, both which came back normal.  My BP was down to 140/90, and when I took it on other various machines I saw it average about 130/80.  I always get nervous when the doctor takes my BP which I think elevates it some.  He THINKS these are what they call PVC's.   7)  I wore a holter monitor for 24 hours and during that time I don't think I had any palpiations that I noticed, maybe one, not sure, I haven't got the results back yet.   When I exercise (running and cycling) I never feel them and I always feel like I am getting plenty of air breathing but sometimes when I am having palpiations I feel the need to take deep breaths, I am not sure if this is anxiety over having them or what.   9)  They seem to have started up again, as the day after the wearing the holter monitor I have had them since.  These have me worried and seem to occupy all my thoughts, when I am working or running I don't really concentrate on them much, but when I have time for my mind to wonder and think I find myself thinking about it constantly.  Basically they are driving crazy.  I would appreciate any help at all.\n\n",

Many people are so used to a certain level of stress, they don't even consider it a problem.  The thing about PVCs (probably what you are experiencing) is that usually stress causes them, and when they happen, you get even more stressed and anxious, so they continue.  If they continue and are very bothersome, perhaps a beta blocker would help; that's traditionally the medication for PVCs.  Lotrel is a channel blocker, which is also widely used, but ask your doctor about something else.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am new. I have been in and out of hospitals a lot in the past 2 months. So far, no conclusions.  Here are my symptoms, ***** \u00a7\tExcruciating pain along the spine, ribs and shoulder blades (Somedays) \u00a7\tDeep, intense stabbing pain that comes in various locations \u2013 abs, spine, chest, finger, head rtc. \u00a7\tAbdominal stiffness and upper-abdominal pain. Muscle twitches in the mid-upper abdomen and around the navel. Worse with hiccupping, burping, yawning and bowel movements. \u00a7\tConstipation, Painful bowels and Bloody stools. \u00a7\tChest Pain- intense chest pain \u00a7\tConstant burping (every 2-3 seconds) and yawning \u00a7\tShortness of breath/Difficulty breathing when breathing through the nose. Gets really bad with exertion.  \u00a7\tPalpitations and nervousness. A weird feeling in the chest and upper bosy of the heart beating or pounding when i wake up from a sitting position.  \u00a7\tCrushing feeling- pressure like feeling in the head and upper chest. Feels like a pressure on the upper body.  \u00a7\tVery bad Migraines with facial pain and visual disturbances \u00a7\tThe muscle tissues and tendons under the skin in the trunk area,  can be felt and are very tender to touch \u00a7\tWeakness and fatigue \u2013 get exhausted too quickly  ***** So far, we've done a number of Rheumatic blood tests and they are all negative. There are no signs of inflammation. I saw a Neurologist, who has put me on Amitriptyline for my migraines and muscle pain. My PCP thinks the pain may be sue to fibromyalgia but i do not have any of those tender points that have been associated with it. The chest pain is sometimes very very severe and also slightly to the left. I personally am sort of positive this has nothing to do with the heart but we havent done any screening on that yet. They did an abdominal CT scan which looked fine. The head CT came negative too. I am meeting up with a GI specialist also on June 6th. I may wanna get the bowels and GI related stuff checked. I have read someplace that constant burping, shortness of breath and chest pain may also be associated with cardiac symptoms. Is that true? Would it be wise to have an exam done for that? If so, what exams are recommended. I shall also be posting in other categories coz its been 2 months and i still don't know what specialty to go to.  I have tried zantacs and all those things but it doesn't seem to wanna help. The Amitriptyline has reduced my headaches and frequency of stabbing pains. I also get good night sleep with those.  Is there anything i need to worry about. Personally, I am very optimistic and think this may not be a very serious condition. I do not have a family history of heart diseases.  Please advise. Thank you.\n\n",

Bloody stools if not hemmorhoids should be evalutated by a GI, good that you are seeing one.  Palpitations, and sometimes chest pain, althoughg not to the extent you are having, either mitral valve prolapse (usually mild and harmless, although palpitations feel more serious).  You need an echocardiogram for that.   Majority of your symptoms can be and very often are depression/anxiety disorder.  If every thing is cleared, you need to see a psychiatrist to be treated properly.  Family doctors are really not trained in that area.  Try to reduce your stress level if at all possible in the meantime.\n\n",

I could easily do 2 aerobic classes back to back. I do not smoke or drink at all. I eat healthy food. I am usually not depressed either. I do the things i normally do. Try to enjoy all the things to the fullest. Its just the physical barrier. There are days i just cant do anything because there is so much pain. I am seeing various doctors. I am seeing a GI soon. I have absolutely no idea what may have caused this because my lifestyle is still the same except with a lot of pain:)  Well, they havent done an echocardiogram or ECG. All they did was 60 seconds of EKG. But then again, the time they ran the exam, i wasnt feeling the way i described.  The symptoms are so vague. Today i am constantly burping and have a chest pain because of the gas buildup. Also, my back realy hurts to a point that i cant bend even to brush or wash hands in the sink.  Ain't this weird. From perfectly healthy to perfectly ill  LOL... I hope i can have them run more exams!!! Tired of this although i try not to even think about it coz sometimes its more mind over matter.  I will keep ya posted. Thanks for your time and reply. I appreciate it.  LibertyGirl\n\n",

Just an aside, if you didn't take the Zantac twice daily every day, it won't work - it's not an antacid.  Try some Gaviscon (best OTC antacid) when you have the gas buildup and belching and start taking the Zantac 150 mg twice per day - that will probably give you some relief while you are waiting on the GI appointment.  He may suggest an endoscopy as well as a colonoscopy.    Yes, burping, chest pain and shortness of breath can be related to heart disease, but angina or coronary artery disease, which you are too young to have yet, and don't appear suddenly.  An echocardiogram would be a good idea, though.  Do keep me posted, I am interested in what is found.\n\n",

The first case was at work and I was standing, listening to a presentation.  I thought it was just that I had my legs locked and I quickly left when I felt the fainting spell coming on.  The second time was when I was standing up at a wedding in the food line.  I started to go down but caught myself on a chair.  I had a friend help me out and I went to the emergency room.    I have had an EKG, Echocardiogram, MRI of my head, Tilt table test (for the dizziness I now have when standing stationary for a long time), halter monitor, chest x-ray, and even went to a opthamologist (my primary care doctor made a suggestion).  Everything was fine except my PCP said that one of my chambers was slightly dialated...but the cardiologist said it was a little but nothing special.  I am 26 (5'10 215) and I could lose some weight but I do workout and used to play football (my bp is good 110s/80s).  I have started running and more cardio which makes me feel better afterwards.  The only thing I can think of is that I helped remove insulation in a water damaged part of my church 1 week before this all started.  But, now I have problems standing for a long period...I start to feel the blood pooling in my legs and get dizzy.  I also have the pressure on my chest sometimes and a little throbing in my left arm (rarely).  My anxiety levels are getting pretty high about this and that probly doesn't make it better.  Help?!  Every doctor has said they don't understand what is wrong.  Could it be a lung problem and not heart?\n\n",

Why not ask your doctor to give you something for your anxiety, which CAN cause many of the symptoms you describe and see if that doesn't help.?  You may think this sounds ridiculous, but what are your eating habits?  Do you go more than 4-5 hours without eating?  Eat sugar or carbs only without protein to balance?  You could be having some low blood sugar, and that can cause the near syncope.  Try eating more protein and \"good \" carbs - whole grain foods, and make sure to have a snack every 3- 4 hours, but don't go any longer than that.\n\n",

Afterwards, the anterior part of the shoulder right in the joint, but definetly at skin deep level,... HURT quite badly...almost a burn, like nerve pain. Lasted all of 2-4 minutes. My left arm and shoulder, however, has not stopped hurting since. [My BP by the way runs 107/75 normally when the proper cuff is used. When using too small, it reads 129/90~] Can you tell me if this pain is in any way related to the artery that runs thru there in the shoulder? Should I be concerned? I have no money to get it checked right now. And with the sharp pain after deflating the cuff, it was kind of scarey. It hurts more upon movement in the joint. And the sister who is a nurse, has me worried!  Thank you so much! Joyce\n\n",

I have been to the school doctor and emergency room.     It started about a week and a half ago i was sitting at my computer and it felt as  if my left peck was was having muscle spasims, but it was more towards the center of my chest.  It lasted for like 4 or 5 heart beats.   My left hand went tingly.   Ever sense then i have felt a weird  flickering in my left chest.  Sometimes I get a shortness of breath as if I can not take full breathes and if I talk i get out of breathe.  I do ocassionally get a mild chest pain, but I have had alot of gas lately.  I have also experinced some muscle spasims in my arms.  My feases has also been a green color lately.  another thing is i seem to be alittle dizzy sometimes and it seems whenever i get in a car I get really dizzy.    I wore the holter moniter and my doctor called me today and said that while  i was wearing i had 2 I guess you can call them episodes. once when i was sleeping and one in the morning were my heart ray was extremely low. he said 34 Beats a minute.  they also did blood work at the hospital, a sonagram on my heart and chest x-rays.  But I did not here any results for any of them?  I know i have been extremely stressing lately becaus of this and I have not been fall ing asleep until 3 am or later.  Also i am defintly getting anxeity but i do not know how much to contribute to that. I am extremely worried and do not trust the doctors here at all.  IWhat is actually worry me most is that they seem very lazy and I  know because of m age they may not be taking me seriously. But i know something is definitly.

    "content": "You more than likely had palpitations - they can feel scary and cause anxiety, even mild panic attacks which have all the symptoms you describe like dizziness, shortness of breath and elevated heart rate.    Anxiety and stress can cause you to have more gas than usual also.  You need to talk to someone about getting control of anxiety, to avoid developing other various symptoms.  More than likely the reason the doctors are acting nonchanlant is because nothing remarkable has shown.  Your lack of sleep makes anxiety worse as well.   Cut out all stimulants and alcohol, avoid sugar, get at least 8 hours of sleep EVERY night, and see someone about your stress/anxiety.  It is very normal for young people, these symptoms are actually quite common.    Your stools could be from diet or medications - if you don't have constipation/diarrhea, I wouldn't worry.  If you continue to worry, ask to have a stool study.\n\n",

    "title": "Palpitations? PACs? \"AF\" history.",
    "content": "34 yo male. Had an episode of palpitations/rapid heart rate in 1987 after intense stress and high caffiene intake.  Tried to ignore the symptoms overnight but finally was taken to the doctor after waking up the next morning still pounding away.  The doctor said it was AF and put me in the hospital, but a traumatic I.V. insertion event (4 missed attempts) left me in a cold sweat and converted me back to normal rhythm.  Was sent home after being checked out.  From then on was in NSR except for feeling occasional 'twitches' usually during exercise.  4 years later during college a hard impact from falling out of a chair triggered another intense episode, very rapid and irregular beating.  ER followed typical conversion attempt procedures (ice water on face, etc) only administering drug to slow heart rate until doctors could check me out.  Was put on rhythmol and kept in the hospital for 2-3 days before converting to NSR.  Was prescribed rythmol and lanoxin(?) and remained on it until prescription ran out, carried on with life.  Again, remained in NSR except for the occasional 'twitches'.  12 years of NSR / occasional 'twitches' - these feel like going into an irregular beat just like the \"AF\" episodes, but only for the space of 1-2 beats.  Once every year or so would have an episode that would last 5 seconds at most.  Occasionally would have 'bad days' when 'twitches' would occur several times.  Have never had any side effects such as passing out or dizziness.  This was true even through 4 years of heavy smoking and caffiene intake.  2003 an episode was triggered again during stretching, leaning back and raising my arms overhead.  Beat was again irregular/rapid like prior events.  ER used drugs to attempt conversion but failed, new Dr. assigned began tests and later said my heart looked healthy.  At one point I bumped my I.V. and caused it to bleed, resulting in queasyness and lightheadedness.  This progressed to passing out wherein my heart was stopped for 6 seconds before starting again on its own.  At first the doctors began discussing a pacemaker, but eventually I assume they were satisfied that it was due to the strong drug keeping my heart rate down combined with the vagal response, and not that I had passed out because of the stoppage.  Had been kept on amiodarone and finally converted the next day after squatting to pick something up.  After release I remained on amiodarone through followup (I don't recall that the doctor ever specifically gave a diagnosis of his own, or if it was assumed it was \"AF\" like I had before).  6 months later I wore a holter monitor which capture 2 of my 'twitch' events.  Unfortunately my appointment to discuss the results was cancelled and I moved shortly after.  Surgery for an unrelated condition a year later went smoothly and they saw no signs of AF or palpitations.  Again I carried on after the amiodarone ran out.  Normally feeling the occasional 'twitches' as before.  Lately, the twitches have become very frequent.  Numerous every day, some worse some better.  I have still never experienced any rapid heart rates, just the irregular 'twitches', nor any dizziness, loss of consciousness, etc.  I have an appointment planned for new doctors but it's still quite a way off.  I'm wondering what the implications of the increased 'twitches' (palpitations?) are, and if I should consider going to the ER if I have a particularly numerous occurence.\n\n",

    "content": "Try to get a copy of that report - most hospitals are required by law to keep patient information for 10 years.  It would be very valuable to show your new doctor, in fact necessary to diagnose your \"twitches\".  There is no way to diagnose them over the net, an ECG having an event is necessary for a diagnosis.  I recommend you stay away from caffeine completely, no alcohol or surgary foods, get at least 8-9 hours of sleep and on a strict schedule, excercise regularly and try to keep stess at a minimum.  The fact that they only last a second or two indicates PVC or PAC and all of these factors can trigger them, but as I said, this is NOT a diagnosis.  PACs and PVCs are not serious.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a female, 39 years old, 5ft tall and 105 pounds  and other than being a somewhat heavy smoker, am in general good health. I have every intention to quit asap. ( this might be the nudge I need)  I woke this morning ( Sunday 5/15)  around 7 am with a mild headache and my left arm hurting. My arm has been hurting off and on for a few weeks. I thought I had pulled a muscle or something and have been extra careful not to overuse it. Eventually the pain would subside but it seems to keep returning. And with great surprise, sometimes even my right arm is beginning to hurt a little. Not much but occassionally. Makes no sense.  I am left handed.  I took 3 aspirin and went to my boyfriends home. (He lives next door) Around 10 am, while watching television I began to sweat and did so intensely. I got up to go to the bathroom to get a cool rag when I began to feel intense pressure on my chest. I've never had indigestion or heartburn that I can recall so I wasn't sure if that could have been it. As I was getting a cool rag to put on my next, I got sick. After vomitting, I told my boyfriend I wasn't feeling well and I went and laid down. The chest pain wasn't a sharp, stabbing pain but an intense pressure that as time went on, felt like it went from my jaw to my middle back. he came in and asked if I wanted to go to the ER. I stated no, I just wanted to rest for I was feeling extremely tired. After an hour or so, I fell asleep. He checked on me several times and I think I may have scared him for I woke once to find him taking my pulse. ( My normal blood pressure runs around 90/65 but with a pulse rate  of 100-105. ) At 3pm , I was still alseeping when he woke me and asked if I could eat. I said yes and ate a light lunch then still feeling extremely tired and although the pain wasn't as bad, was and am as of writing this, still have some pressure in my chest and my arm is still hurting.  I didn't wake up until 11 this evening. I normally do not require much sleep. I am somewhat hyper in nature so to sleep like I did and to still, after sleeping like I did today, feel quite fatigued accompanied by the incident today has me a little concerned. Could it have been a reaction to the aspirin with having just coffee this morning? I am considering going to the ER in the morning for my mother called while I was sleeping and though she is in another state, is extremely worried. Any idea what went on? Thank you for any input.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Poohpotta,  To decide whether or not chest pain is due to coronary disease, major risk factors for coronary disease and characteristics of the chest pain are evaluated and the probability of the pain be due to coronary disease are then assessed.  Looks like you don't have any major risk factor for coronary disease except for smoking (and you stopped but the effect on the arteries linger for a long time though). The characteristics of the pain sound atypical.  i think that you have a neck problem as well which is not common in persons who are sitting on the computer all day long and the majority of them usual sit in an unhealthy fashion.  i recommend that you have a neck x-ray to evaluate your neck spine in addition to informing your physician about the chest pain. We are not in a position to rule out any cardiac cause, this is for your physician to decide.

    "content": "Earlier this year I had multiple episodes of syncope (approx 50). In an earlier post you recommended that I underwent EEG, CT brain and Tilt Testing. I saw my cardiologyist and had tilt table testing which didn't induce syncope but showed multiple episodes of pre-syncope with hypotension (95/85) and sinus tachycardia (up to 170/min). I was diagnosed as having vasodepressor component malignant vasovagal syncope and was told it was probably POTS. I was started on Fludrocortisone with some benefit then had Bisoprolol added. Since starting the beta-blocker I have had a few minor pre-syncopal episodes but no syncope. I was wondering if you had any advice on the following points:  Should I undergo any further tests (I wasn't offered an EEG or CT scan)?  Is taking fludrocortisone (200mcg od) long-term problematic and should I be taking calcium supplements / bisphosphonate / having my U&Es or other bloods monitored?  When should I consider applying to be allowed to drive again (in the UK) (I have been syncope free for 2 months)?  Is POTS likely to ruin my career aspirations (medical SHO wanting to be an interventional cardiologist)? Sorry to ask so many questions, it can be difficult to ask my consultant as he is a collegue and I feel I ought to know the answers.  Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome",
    "content": "Dear Flop,  Thank you very much for the update.  i don't think that there is an indication for the eeg or the ct scan of the head since you had a positive tilt table test and since you are improving on the medications prescribed to you.  Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome is most probably caused by some kind of autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Beta blockers and fludrocortisone help many patients and it seems that you are getting better. There are some side effects to fludrocortisone but these are different from the ones caused by the most commonly used prednisone. You don't have to worry about your bones when taking fludrocortisone.  As regard to your career plans, i don't think that having pots will affect them, but you are going to be on your feet most of the time and i think that wearing an elastic stocking (the medical type of course) might help. These are used a lot in patients with orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when patients assumes the standing position) and it proves to be very helpful in most of the cases. And since pots is most probably a part of the spectrum of orthostatic hypotension, i would encourage you to discuss this with your doctor and see what he thinks about you wearing the stockings. There is only one problem, they are not comfortable and they are a hassle to wear but i think that it is worth the hassle.  As for driving, you have to ask about the regulations in the driver's liscence offices or bureaus in the united kingdom as i am not familiar with them. But if you had not had a syncopal episode in two months, i would say that this is a safe period.

    "title": "Re: Heart palpitations",
    "content": "Dear Hamad,  The condition that you are referring to is most probably mitral valve prolapse which is known to cause atypical chest pain and palpitations.  As for the palpitations, besides mitral valve prolpase, it has other causes including: 1. An overactive thyroid gland. 2. Electrolytes disturbance. 3. Smoking. 4. Drinking alcohol. 5. Drinking too much caffeinated beverages. 6. Not getting enough sleep. 7. Stress.   So, i would suggest that you have blood tests for thyroid functions and electrolytes if this has not been done already.  Please, stop smoking and all kind of stimulants (including alcohol, coffee, tea, pepsi and or street drugs if you are using any) and you will find that these measures will help the palpitations a lot. Also, if you get enough rest and sleep, this helps to the extent that you might be able to go off the concor.  As for concor, it is most probably the cause behind the fatigue that you are experiencing. Concor belongs to a group of medications called beta blockers and this group of medications can cause depression in some patients, concor itself was not described to cause this side effect but since it belongs to this group, it is assumed that it can cause depression.  It is normal that your heart increases when you start any activity or after you wake up. Please, stop paying so much attention to your heart rate as this will make it worse.  About talking and getting lightheaded with white foam at the corners of your mouth, sometimes if you talk too fast or don't take enough breaths in between sentences you will start hyperventilating and get dizzy. About the foam, it is not unusual to have such foam at the corner of the mouth if you don't have enough time to swallow your salive when you talk. There is nothing to worry about.

They took my blood pressure it was 180/105. They diagnosed me with migraines. they did not run any tests on me. When I asked them why my blood pressure was so high they said it was cause I was in pain. so I went home. A few months later I had another episode of the same symptoms, but this time I was short of breath also. they did a ekg and determined that I was having Tachycardia palpatiations. My blood pressure again was very high. htey had me follow up with my family doctor. I did and I was diagnosed with hypertension. I am now taking meds, and for the most part have my blood pressure under control. I still get chest pain though and nobody seems to know why. my cholesterol is fine. All my blood work came back normal. Can you help me understand my condition a little better. most doctors think because i am so young I should not have these problems\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kai,  A high blood pressure can cause headache a blurred vision. It is difficult to say which one caused the other.   High blood pressure can also cause chest discomfort.  Females of child bearing age are naturally protected against coronary disease. You have one risk factor for coronary disease (hypertension) and it is controlled. You did not mention any of the characteristics of the chest pain that you get and without the characteristics of the chest pain, i can not tell the probability of this pain be due to coronary disease. But since you don't have but one major risk factor (and it is controlled), i don't think that this chest pain is due to coronary disease.  i recommend that you have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to exclude a condition called mitral valve prolapse which can be the cause of chest pain.  High blood pressure at a young age usually raises the suspicion for secondary causes of hypertension such as hyperactive thyroid gland and the like, please, discuss this with your doctor.

    "content": "Dear kmm,  Having chest pain and high troponin level means that you had heart damage. Whether or not this is due to a heart attack, i can not say. You had an angiogram and this was a very reasonable step.   At your age, you should not have coronary disease unless you have had major risk factors for quite some time and you don't.  A stenosis of 30% is not a significant lesion that would cause a heart attack. i think what happened and may be still happening is that you might have been getting coronary artery spasms which are severe enough to cause heart damage.  Was it the first time that you had chest pain the time you were admitted to the icu and had a high troponin level? Do you use any recreational drugs such as cocaine (very well known to cause coronary spasms)? Can you describe the pain that you had then? What did your electrocardiogram show? Was coronary spasm tested for in the angiogram? Were you told that you had something called a myocardial bridge?  This heart damage might have been caused by inflammation of the membranes surrounding the heart that extended to the heart muscle and caused this minor damage as well. Were you having a cold or flu like symptoms at that time?  How often are you following up with your doctor? You have to tell your doctor about these chest pains. How often are checking your cholesterol (total cholesterol is not the one to look at, ldl (bad cholesterol) and hdl (good cholesterol) have to be checked.  Before starting exercising once more, your doctor has to clear you. You have to lead a healthier life style.  You have to stop smoking.

    "content": "Dear Dr. Mokhtar,  First i would like to thank you for your time and reply.  I check with my doctor every 2 month, i do a cholestrol test every 6 month. which is usually boarderline high My Hdl is 1.09 (42.183)  my Ldl is 4.17 (161.379) the average is 5.33 (206)  Yesterday they make a troponnin test (actually all 4 enzymes) and they was all normal, the reason to do that was my lipid test the general (Creatine Kenase) was 640. and my doctor have stopped the lipitor.  The time i went to the ICU was the second time i felt this pain, if i might try to explaine it , it was not a pain it was more like a heavinness on the left side and sweating. First time my tropinin was 0.08 and i didn't make an angio but it got reduced to below o.o4 on the second test. second time: My tropinnin was 2.3 then the second test after 8 hours was back to normal.  My doctor never mentioned to me the artery spasms, however i did ask him and he say he doubt it, and i'm taking Delzim Retard 90, he said it's good for spasm too.  Was not tested on my angio report. and i was not told that i had something called a myocardial bridge.   My ECG was normal, they put me on an ECG monitiored for 24 hrs.  What was mentioned is a minor stenosis 30% on the dominant RCA, slow blood motion due to smoking, my doctor said it's because of my life style of smoking and no excerise.  I don't take any recreational drugs such as cocaine .  i really don't think that i had a flu or cold at this time.  i spoke to my doctor about the chest pain, and he said it might be the muscels between the ribs, and he is sure that it's not my heart.  i still feel paranoid whenever i got any chest pain, and i don't know if this 30% could go worst or better?   Also i get more paranoid when i heard about the spasms, i've read about it and it worries me more than before. how can i know that i have spasm or not.............please advise   Thank you, i really appreciate your reply. KMM\n\n",

    "content": "Dear kmm,  Thank you very much for the update.  You don't have to worry about the 30% stenosis.  Regarding the spasm, you are already taking the medication that would be given to a patient who has proven spasms.  If you have migraines and you take medications for it, these medications cause coronary spasms.  About the slow flow, some patients especially if older, are started on blood thinners especially if they have chest pain. You already had a small heart attack. i think it is not unwise to ask your doctor about the blood thinners.

    "content": "Lissette,  I\u2019m going to start off by saying the symptoms you describe are kind of vague and do not really point to any real diagnosis.  My first thought was anxiety but again, especially in this format, with what you describe it\u2019s not easy to provide any more concrete answers.  Do you have any other signs or symptoms like rapid breathing or numbness or tingling i.e. hands or face; is there any pattern to what you described?   You mentioned you were concerned about PVC\u2019s (premature ventricular contractions).  Yes PVC\u2019s can be attributed to, and may lead to, some significant health concerns however they could also be caused by caffeine, chocolate, stress, smoking, alcohol, etc.  In young people they are usually of no consequence.  They are quite common and how they feel (if you feel it at all) is subjective; what one person may feel another may not.    It\u2019s always recommended that if you have concerns see your family physician.   Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "Chest tightness and middle back pain w/ deep breathing",
    "content": "Since the end of last week my chest has been feeling particularily tight when I take a deep breath. Along with taking a deep breath I have an aching pain, that comes and goes when I am in different positions, in the middle of my back right under my ribs. I thought that maybe I was having an anxiety attack because I had been out of my anxiety meds for four days straight and I was having panic attacks 2 days before I got my period which usually happens a day or two before, without the meds due to my hormones. I was hyperventilating one morning and I freaked out so bad!  Now that I have had them refilled and I have been taking my meds, I am still feeling tight in the chest kind of like something is swollen around my lungs or someone is standing on my back. I talked to a pharmacist who suggested trying Muscinex in case there was some mucus in my lungs, which I did but I am not having any wheezing or anything like that and it didn't help. I also take Advair for my asthma and this doesn't feel asthma related. I babysit for a physician and his family so one day I talked to him about it and he came over to listen to my lungs as well as my heart my heart since I am on Ortho-tri cyclen Lo and he wanted to listen for any murmurs or clots. He said that my lungs sounded just fine, no wheezing or anything..nice and clear, and as far as my heart goes...he didn't hear anything irregular. He asked me if I had heart palpatations but I only had them with the anxiety attacks and he said that's normal with panic attacks. I have good blood pressure, last time I went it was 110/70 and my HR is 62 beats per minute, I do cardio/weight training 5 days a week, I don't smoke, I only drink on occassion and lately not at all, I do have bad eating habits because I don't eat enough fruits, vegies, and meats...mostly carbs and sweets but I am working on improving balancing my diet, and I'm 24. Do you think that this could be at all heart related or is this something else? Could this be allergy related because this really started to happen as soon as the weather warmed up? The Dr. told me that the soreness is most likely muscle sorness from the anxiety and heavy breathing it caused. Is there anything else that could be? I would like some idea of what I should have looked at because I am having surgery in 3 weeks and I need to be in great shape before it. I don't have insurance so if I have tests done I need to know what is the most logical place to look first.  Thanks,    C\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dawn,  i tend to agree with Theresa that most probably the respiratory symptoms are not related to simvastatin.  However, simvastatin and the group of medications to which it belongs are notorious for causing muscle inflammation. If this muscle inflammation affects the chest muscles it can lead to your feeling of shortness of breath.  i would strongly recommend that you talk to your doctor about it and be seen and have a blood test to rule out muscle damage.

    "title": "Chest pains and headache.",
    "content": "I am 22 years old. When I was born the doctors didn't know what was wrong with me because my  heart beat extremely fast. Eventually I was diagnosed with Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome (WPW). I had this condition until I was 16, which is when I had cardio ablation done. Up until that point I was on different variations of Lanoxin and Inderal. These medications are the reason (I am told) that I had asthma as a child. Once I stopped the medication after the Ablation I started running and I never had any problems after that. However I did have this weird burping problem. Ever since the cardio ablation I have issues getting food down. I burp it up, sometimes it comes out of my nose, and recently this reflux  has caused me to have severe chest pains (so I am told by some doctors). It has become debilitating at times and I have to avoid certain foods as a result (the worst food is pasta. It never seems to digest). Ok, that is my cardio background. Other background: I am a Merchant Marine. I went to the US Merchant Marine Academy and I spent a year sailing aboard various ships. At sea I was extremely sea sick. I lost a great deal of weight. I was originally 135, then when I got back I was 104. I have since regained some of it back (now 120), but I have been having weird medical problems since (which may or may not be related to what I am feeling now). This time at sea was spent from 2001-2003. Throughout my time at the academy I also was diagnosed with orbital inflammatory and suffered from occasional short periods of an inflamed eye and a severe migraine (usually lasting 1-2 weeks). I also had one episode of Vasal Vegal when I hurt myself lifting during this time. Last year, around June,  I was put on Birth Control (Ortho Evera). I became extremely moody and depressed. I also would go through periods of sweats and often felt like I was going to pass out. When I stood up sometimes, I felt really lightheaded. In December, after I suddenly passed out, I stopped wearing the patch. I began to have severe chest pains. When I worked out I would feel the muscles tighten in the left side of my neck.  My reflux became unbearable as well. And I was suffering from EXTREMELY painful stomach aches. I went to the doctor and he seemed to rule out any correlation to the birth control (which I disagree... but I am not a doctor). He said that when I was over in Spain back in August that I caught some bug that was causing the increased reflux and the stomach pain. He also said the chest pain was due to the reflux. SO, he put me on a pill to kill the virus and then he put me on Nexium to rid me of the reflux. The nexium seemed to be working, and the stomach aches went away. I went to the cardiologist also (just to be safe). He put me on a heart monitor and did an echo and an EKG and found nothing. He did say that I may have mitral valve prolapse (my sister has this and so did my grandmother. As a side note, my Aunt has Bundle Branch Syndrome). He told me this when I questioned why my value for cholesterol was so high even though I am a healthy eater. Then he sent me to another cardiologist (the one who did my ablation many years ago) and he ruled out any correlation between the reflux and the ablation (which I disagree on again). He thought that maybe I was having issues with my blood pressure. He based this on the results from the heart monitor (which I wore for 24hrs). It showed my heart going from 30 beats per minute then jumping up to 150 beats per minute at random times. He determined that this was all blood pressure related and said that I show no signs of WPW coming back.  BUT, this doctor wasn't on my insurance plan, so I didn't get the table tilt test he ordered done.  However, things got worse. Things changed. All of a sudden I started getting these SEVERE headaches. First I went to my eye doctor because my vision was horrible all of a sudden (I normally have 20/20 vision) and because I have a history of Orbital Inflammatory and he was the doctor who diagnosed it the first time. He sent me to a neurologist who ended up doing all of the blood pressure tests and found nothing. YES, I have really low blood pressure, but he found no correlation. There was also nothing wrong with my electrical brain frequencies. I stopped the nexium because I learned that it causes severe migraines occasionally, but it did nothing. Then , finally in the end of February, FOUR weeks after the headaches started and one trip to the emergency room later, the doctor did an MRI and found that all of the muscles around my eye were inflamed, thus causing the pain. They put me on Prednisone for about 6 weeks. The headaches went down. (Note: The catscan at the hospital was clear). NOW... currently I am off all medications and the chest pains are starting again. I have a dull headache that is constant. I feel like my heart is really weak. The reflux is back. And I don't know what to do. None of these doctors seem to be able to figure it out and I am tired of being sent all over the place and getting no results. I did do blood work after all meds were stopped and everything was in range except one value which I am told is an indication that I may have a virus. My doctors had been concerned that I might have Lymphoma or a thyroid problem, but the tests indicate otherwise. However, the review  did show evidence of high lymphocytes. When I go for a run now, I get a pounding headache. It usually goes away after about 10 minutes, but it is unbearable. Sometimes it is centralized to the back of my head, but other times it is my entire head. And my heart just feels weak. Bottom line: I feel terrible and nobody knows why. My heart feels like it is always being strained. I am afraid to run because I am afraid my heart can't handle it. And I am always worried about what to eat.  Any advice on what I should do next would be GREATLY appreciated. I am 22 years old and I hate feeling like this! Thank you so much for any help you can offer! At this point, even advice on what type of doctor to go to would be welcome!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear vkgigante,  i think the chest pain that you have is related to your heart burn. i think it is safe to restart the nexium once more.  The headaches that you are complaining from can be due to residual inflammation of the eyes.  i suggest that you see an ophthalmologist (an eye specialist) for the inflammation of the eyes if you have not already seen one.  If you are told that the headaches are not caused by the inflammation of the eye then i suggest you see a neurologist (better be interested in headaches) for the headaches.  If your heart rate is down to 30 at times when it is not supposed to be like during sleep, i recommend that you have another holter monitor to make sure that this is not caused by intermittent heart block (one of the long term complications of ablation).

    "content": "I am a 47 year old male.  Have always been physically active.  I smoke between 1/2 to 1 pack of cigarettes per day.  4 months ago I started noticing some strange \"blips\" in my chest and started having problems with my heart racing out of nowhere.  I went to an emergency room one night thinking I was having a heart attack.  Through EKG it was determined that everything was normal, that I was having some PVC's that seemed normal, and that I needed to cut down or quit caffeine and cigarettes.  I went to my regular doctor and did a stress echo test which came back normal.  All blood tests are normal.  Last BP was 112/72.  Normal pulse ranges between 60 and 72.  Lately I have been having problems with dizziness and I've noticed discoloration in my hands (Paritcularly right hand) when standing.  Discoloration is dark red or purple.  Dizziness is of a vertigo nature, not light headed.  I have learned to live with the PVC's, have not been having the racing heart (cut our caffeine and reducing nicotine).  The dizziness is concerning me as is my hand discoloration.  I don't seem to be getting anywhere yet with the doctors.  Any thoughts or suggestions?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Wallin,  The hand discoloration if was caused by cold weather is called Raynaud's phenomenon and could be a primary disorder (not caused by other diseases) or secondary, caused by other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or scleroderma.  But having discoloration when you stand up is a little bit confusing, does it happen every time you stand up? Has it been witnessed by your doctor? Do you have a good pulse in the hand(s) where this phenomenon happens?  As for the vertigo, it could be caused by a neurological problem or an ear problem.  i suggest that you be seen by a rheumatologist (for the discoloration problem) if your doctor thinks it is indicated vs being seen by a vascular surgeon.  As for the vertigo, either to be seen by an e.n.t. specialist or a neurologist.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

Most of the vertigo symptoms are when I am standing as well.  I showed it to my doctor (stood up and let my hands dangle) and he checked my pulse and said my circulation was fine.  No other comment.  Also, since I posted my original question I have been to an e.n.t. for the vertigo and had an MRI which came back normal.  The doctor said maybe I had picked up a virus and that it should clear up in a few months.  (Ears checked out fine).\n\n",

Every other month I had a UTI or yeast infection as well.  For these reasons I stopped taking the pill.  Since that time I have become very anxious and jittery and have developed heart palpitations.  I have noticed that the anxiety and  heart palpitations are more frequent the week before my period and through the week of my period.  My heart pounds at unusual times such as when I am sitting at my desk at work or on the computer.  Whenever I reach for something or have to bend down to pick something up or pet my dog for example I get a heart palpitation.  Mt heart skips a beat and then there are a few weaker beats and then pow it beats really hard and then goes back to it's normal rythm.   This will happen maybe 3 or 4 times and hour and then stop a few hours and return again.  I also have a very hard time falling asleep.  When I do I am almost immediatly startled awake for no reason.  This will cycle for hours throughout the night.  I had a heart monitor for 24 hours that came back normal and three thyroid tests that were also normal.  Should I wait and have these tests done while I am on my period?  I am not overweight, and infact have dropped about 10 pounds (124lbs. - 114lbs.)   in the past 4 months.  This has been going on for 6 months .  Is there anything else I can do.  My doctor put me on Xanax for anxiety, but that does not stop the heart palpitations which causes the anxiety.  Any advice or ideas about what to do next?  I would really appreciate any advice.  I have not had caffeine in 6 months, I do not smoke or drink.  I eat healthy meals and try to stay active.

    "content": "Dear Zsuzsi,  Besides the thyroid blood tests, have you had any other blood tests? i suggest that you have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to exclude mitral valve prolpase, a condition that causes palpitations and atypical chest pain.  Did the holter monitor that you had show any periods of fast heart rate that did not correspond to appropriate activity? Did you have any fast heart rate while asleep.  Why did you start having this anxiety since you stopped taking the pill, are you afraid of becoming pregnant and you are not using any other birth control measure?   The palpitations that you are having could be due to the anxiety that you have. You could also use a very low dose diuretic during the time prior to your period and during your period to see whether or not it helps with the anxiety.

    "title": "Re: Palpitations, chest and back pain",
    "content": "Dear Stevie,  Palpitations have several causes including: 1. Mitral valve prolapse (a condition associated with palpitations, atypical chest pain in the otherwise healthy young adult). 2. Hyperactive thyroid gland. 3. Electolyte disturbances. 4. Smoking. 5. Drinking alcohol. 6. Drinking too much caffeinated beverages. 7. Being tired and not getting enough sleep. 8. Stress.  9. Others causes related to the heart such as coronary disease and heart failure.  If you have not already had blood tests for electrolytes and thyroid functions, i recommend that you have them.  i also recommend that you have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to exclude mitral valve prolapse.   Please, stop smoking, drinking alcohol if you are, have enough rest and sleep. These measures should help getting rid of the flutters that happen every now and then.  You did not mention having any risk factors for coronary disease so i will assume that you don't have any and this means that i think that the stress test is going to be negative.  What was the diagnosis that you were told when you were admitted to the hospital for 2 days? Were you seen by a cardiologist or cardiologist specialized in arrhythmias?  Emcore is a medication that causes the heart rate to be slow and is an antiarrhythmic at the same time, so if you stop it and it was controlling your arrhythima then your arrhythmia will start to appear once more. You should never stop this medication suddenly and before stopping it for any reason, you have to consult with the prescribing physician first.  Taking such a medication for an unknown long period of time, in my personal opinion, is not that practical. i would like to suggest that if you were not seen by a cardiologist specialized in arrhythmias (called electrophysiologist), i would like to suggest that you be seen by one for the possibility of having a test called an electrophysiologic study.

Up untill this point I had felt on top fo the world I started drinking the recomended amoutn of water and was feeling awesome about life.  And one day I drank a drink that my friend suggested I tried that increases your energy allowing you to have endurance while you're working out, and my heart went nuts and I think I might have pulled something in my back while doing dead lifts...  That day I went home and my heart felt like it was beating at the speed of light and I kept feeling like i was going to burst... Learned my lesson never drink one of those again....  But now ever since Whenever i run or try to do something my chest kills...  For example,,, I get this sore or sharp kind of pain when I breathe in REALLY heavy or run or play basketball or do anythign with activity or if I lay the wrong way.... I also have a cold if that means anything..  I don't' drink, smoke, do drugs.....  I'm worried I'm kind of hoping this could be a bruised rib or something cause I am quite scared  Please help\n\n",

If it's pleurisy, it's probably viral and it'll take its time to resolve...if the problem persist for more than a week and getting worse,please contact your GP.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear charleyd15, Anxiety can be accompanied by a variety of physical symptoms. Most commonly, these symptoms are related to the heart, lungs, and nervous system. You may feel as if you are having a heart attack.  Panic disorders, are separate and intense periods of fear or feelings of doom developing over a very short time frame, usually 10 minutes and are associated with at least 4 of the following:  palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, sense of choking, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, a feeling of being detached from the world (derealization), fear of dying, numbness or tingling and chills or hot flushes.  You have done well by going to see your doctor, I'm sure if there was the least suspicion of anything serious, he would have tried to pursue the issue further. If he isn't worried, you should not worry. One last thing, is that you may feel anxiety for a long time, perhaps your entire life. Excellent medications are available to help many of the symptoms, together with counseling with mental health professionals, can be highly successful.\n\n",

If u had another anginal attack , went to the hospital ,got high levels of serum tropinin I and cardiac enzymes, new ECG changes compared to your old ones, then another angiogram should be highly considered and compared to your previous one ofcourse.

    "content": "About a month ago, I woke up and the room was spinning around me. I went to the ER and they advised I had an upper respitory infection. Two days after that I had a 104 temp, and diagnosed with strep throat. I was on antibiodics for 10 days. After the 10 days, I started what I call feeling \"dizzy\". Nothing was spinning, I wasn't spinning, but just haven't felt \"right\". I felt like at times, I just have to stand or sit in one spot to feel \"normal\", again, nothing spinning. I had a CT scan, all normal, including the sinus. I since went to an ENT specialist who said I have a deveated septum, and possible allergies, and scheduled me for a sleep apnea test which he thinks may cause my dizziness and headaces. The ENT ruled out at this time any ear problems. The past week, have had headaces behind my eyes and near temple areas, the dizziness has been a bit better. Also, I have been on Alavert and Flo Nase nasal spray. I really have had allergies all my life, take a couple of pills, and I am done with it. However, never had this many headaches and feeling \"dizzy\" for this amount of time. Any suggestions?  Thank You\n\n",

You don't have any risk factors for coronary disease and the chest pain that you have is atypical, so the chest pain that you have is not due to coronary disease.  From your history and the description of the pain, this sounds like a pulled muscle or other chest wall cause more than anything else.

Smoker since age 16. Retired police officer, so I have had my share of strange work hrs and bad diets at times.  Currently a gym rat going twice a day most days. I am 5'6\" , weigh 187, with a body fat of 19 to 21 % depending on the day. I lift heavy most of the time doing 120 dumbbells. Have done a lot of cardio, and go in two, threee month cycles. Try and do one hour of cardio a day, pluse lifting for a hour or so. Recently got a heart rate monitro and found that during cardio heart rate is 145 or so and returens to 90 after a minute or so. Cant seem to loose a single pund however even after a three month cyle. Eat pretty clean. When I lift however, the heart rate goes to 175 - 200 for a max effort. I had a nulcear stress test approx two months ago that was \"normal\" Is that sudden spike a concern? Is the heart medicine defeating the cardio efforts and the reason I cant loos the tummy fat etc.? I have large muscle groups and have a 46 inch chest and a 36 inch waist. Recenty had a expereince in the gym after a max effort with the 120 lb dumbells, and felt mild jaw pain, but maybe pyscosomatic?Bench usually over 300. Any ideas?\n\n",

It is not though unreasonable to think that when you do such a short lived very stressful kind of exercise that your heart rate goes up so high for the time of exercise and then goes down very fast (which is a sign of physical fitness).  If your jaw pain was due to coronary disease, you wouldn't have been able to go through all these heavy duty workouts.  Regarding the tummy, i suggest that you consult with a professional trainer to see what he/she thinks about what kind of exercise can be done to target this specific area.

    "content": "Dear Minjo,  Shortness of breath has many causes starting with something as simple as being phsyically unfit and ending with something seroius such as heart or lung failure.  Did your father have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) recently?  If yes, what was the ejection fraction (how strong the heart contracts) of your father's heart? Does he have diastolic dysfunction which is abnormal relaxation of the left ventricle? The ejection fraction could have been mentioned in the cath report as well. It looks however that his cardiologist (or cardiothoracic surgeon) is 100% convinced that the heart is fine and is not the cause of the shortness of breath to the extent that he is not going to see him again.  Did your father have a lung function test? If not, this could be of value and i would recommend that he has one.

I have a slyght arythmia but was told nothing serious and that I did not have to return unless I felt it necessary.  I am having left arm and shoulder pain, how long does it take for a heart problem to develop?  I suffer from hiatus hernia and obesity but have lost 30 pounds already.  I also take various medications for the hernia and to treat the obesity causes, have frequent diarrea.  Could this cause a heart attack?  please reply  thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctor,  I am the mother of a 15yr old boy we live in Adelaide Australia. For the past 13mths my son has been suffering with vasovagal syncope it started happening after a knock to the head. It started with unconcious spells once a month for the first 6mths and has now become 2 or 3 times a week for the past 3mths. The cardiologist has done a tilt table test and said he definately is suffering with vasovagal attacks.He also has low blood pressure & supposedly a low heart rate (BRADYCARDIA) he has been taking Florinef which the cardiologist said should slow or stop the episodes. But then he has been taken to a different hospital for observation and they say they are not vasovagal and recommend he has a holter monitor. There reason for saying that is he has no symptoms prior to a collapse apart from feeling tired and when LOC occurs it last for at least 20mins and can be longer, when he comes round he is always dizzy and has a pain from behind the neck that goes right through to his legs. It takes at least 3 to 4 days for him to be able to lift his right leg off the ground and it is icy cold like he has lack of circulation. It is getting to the point now that he is not fully recovered from one episode before another one occurs. He also after the knock to head had an MRI that showed he had a Pineal Gland Cyst of 2cm * 1.8cm that is of no concern to the neurosurgeon he has had 2 follow up MRI & MRA to check blood flow in the brain(when I type brain we mean only the brain) and assess the cyst. we have a Cardiologist, Neurosurgeon, Neurologist & Endocrinologist. Not one of these doctors can tell us what is really going on and we don't want to disbelieve what they say but we have to wonder. He also has been referred to a neurophysc for assessment. He was very nice and said that Rhys was coping well for a boy that doctors can't agree on a diagnosis.  I hope you can recommend something for us to do this is not only effecting his body it is also making him very depressed.  Thank You  Cherryl\n\n",

    "title": "Anxiety/depression and cardiovascular conditions",
    "content": "Hello.  I am a 19 year-old female and am currently undergoing a lot of stress because of life circumstances, which have possibly triggered the following:  I am not officially diagnosed (by a psychiatrist) with, but will probably be diagnosed with general anxiety disorder as well as panic disorder.  I had an episode of depression last year and was on Wellbutrin XL 150 for over six months.  It worked quite well and I came off it about 3 or 4 months ago thinking the depression would not return because of a good change in circumstances.    Currently, I have had an EKG once which turned out to be normal but according to my physician, my heart rate was bordering fast which indicated stress, and ever since the anxiety hasn't left me and I have had several minor and a couple of major panic attacks until two nights ago.  I am very concerned about any heart and/or respiratory problems even though I am aware of the anxiety.  Furthermore, I have learned that over time too much stress and anxiety can lead to heart problems.  I have long periods of chest discomfort and pressure with occasional pain and often palpitations, but these are also accompanied by light headedness, numbness, hot flushes/chills, shortness of breath, and other symptoms common for anxiety.    However, recently I was also given results of a blood test done for my thyroid levels and the nurse practitioner told me they seemed to be low (she was a bit vague on the whole), and that I should go back in a month for a reassessment of my thyroid.  What concerns me is that my mother has had (I believe) abnormal thyroid and surgery.  I am anxious to know if it's okay to disregard these chest pains/pressures and if they have nothing to do with thyroid condition.     For further information, I do not smoke, drink, or do any form of drugs.  I am not overweight either.  The only history of heart disease I know of is my grandfather (mother's side) who had a heart attack in his 40s, but according to my mother he smoked a lot and also developed lung cancer.  So now, I am curious to know if anxiety will contribute to major physical problems and/or if I should consider more thorough testing?  Thank you for your time.  Any input would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Anxiety/depression and cardiovascular conditions",
    "content": "Dear Serenety,  Chest pain, discomfort, shortness of breath and palpitations are part of anxiety symptomatology.  It is sometimes difficult to differentiate if the person does not have a history of anxiety/panic attacks.  In your case, i think it is a very high possibility that this is just anxiety, however, there is a condition known as mitral valve prolapse which can cause chest discomfort and palpitations. It is diagnosed by having an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) and needs to be watched if it is there.  i recommend that you have an echocardiogram to rule out this condition.   As to your thyroid problem, the most commonly used thyroid test and it is the measurement of a hormone called tsh in the blood, if the level of this hormone is high, this means that the thyroid gland is actually underactive, and if the level is low, then the thyroid is overactive. So, what she said can go both ways because she had to specify what was low. If the thyroid gland was overactive, this can explain your symptoms of tachycardia, anxiety and palpitations.  i guess you already had the repeat test or at least about to. Keep us posted.

    "title": "NonStandard Syncopal episodes",
    "content": "My question is in reference to my husband.  He is a 48 y.o. white male who was a firefighter/paramedic and Navy Hospital Corpsman prior to 11/1990 when he was injured working for a private ambulance company.  He has a bilateral traumatic pars defect of his L-5 vertebra, which is now offset by 8mm with 2mm free movement on flexion/extension.  He has disc herniation at L5/S1 and bulges at L4/L5, L3/L4 and L2/L3.  He has arachnoiditis, spondylodosis, spondylothesis, radiculopathy, neuropathy, and RSD.  He takes Methadone and OxyIR for pain control and takes Tizanidine for involuntary muscle spasms.    He has also been diagnosed as having some autonomic dysreflexia, though he is not completely symptomatic.  He suffered right knee trauma during the same accident and has had ineffective surgical repairs for his anterior/posterior/lateral horn menisci.  He suffered a ventral hernia during the same accident and has had ineffective surgery to repair that, as well.  He has developed diabetes mellitus, though his HA1C was 6.4 when last measured.  Normal blood sugars range from 100-120 with some higher and lower fluctuations.  He takes Glucophage and Glucotrol for sugar control.  He has some diabetic neuropathy from the balls of his feet through his toes.  He has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease and has had at least one heart attack, noted in the past year.  He has undergone seven cardiac catheterizations since April 2004 and had angioplasty to remove a 90% blockage of his LAD.  When the artery later recoiled, two stents were placed in a trifurcation.  Although the arteries from the trifurcation are now clear, a secondary artery off the LAD is now blocked by one of the stents.  He is on Toprol to control his usually high blood pressure, and Plavix and aspirin for the stents.  He also takes NitroQuik for episodes of chest pain.  His last catheterization in January 2005 showed no significant blockages and an ejection fraction of 67.  His carotid arteries have been diagnosed as 50% occluded on the right side and 30% on the left, based on views during one of his catheterizations.    Due to the arachnoiditis and the dry mouth caused by multiple medications, he\u2019s also suffered rampant tooth decay and has all but the last two of his teeth removed in the last year and a half.  Bilateral ultrasounds of his lower extremities following concerns over pain, swelling and redness in his legs are scheduled for the next two weeks.  Two days after the first catheterization in April 2004, the dental clinic at the hospital pulled seven of his teeth at one time under questionable local anesthesia.  During the extractions, they managed to open a hole in his upper jaw into his sinus.  Now, after all of that, here is the question:  Approximately 24 hours later, his pulse began to drop through the 60s, 50s and into the low 40s (43).  He complained of nausea, became diaphoretic, agitated, confused, disoriented, experienced white or grayed out vision, and thought he smelled smoke or burning.  His BP dropped to 67/43 and his pulse ox dropped to 88.  Eventually, he lost consciousness and fell into a deep sleep from which he was unable to be roused for about two hours.  When he \u2018regained consciousness\u2019, he was extremely drowsy, disoriented, and had no memory of what had happened immediately preceding and during the syncopal episode.  At the time he began to feel the onset of the symptoms, he had been sitting up on the side of his hospital bed.  Lying him down and running IV fluids did little to bring him around.  Since that episode, he has experienced the same scenario about 100-150 times.  The number is not completely clear because he does experience this problem during the night and work day when he is essentially alone.  Points of interest:  1.\tDoes not seem to be positional.  Has had episodes standing, sitting and lying down. 2.\tDoes not seem to be narcotic related.  He\u2019s been on the same medication regimen for almost eight years and never suffered from these episodes.  Plus, during various hospital stays, staff has removed him from the medication, varied the dose administration and timing. 3.\tDoes not seem to be diabetic in nature.  Blood sugars have been measured at normal levels and at extremely high levels (due to removal of glucophage for catheterization procedures).  Syncopal episodes still seem to be the same. 4.\tHas had tilt table test.  Test was ruled conditionally negative.  The nurse was unable to induce the syncopal episode; however, he\u2019d just received 48 hours of IV fluids following the stent placements. 5.\tOther EP doctors have refused to repeat tilt test because they feel that the duration of the \u2018unconscious\u2019 period (10 minutes to 5 hours) negates neurocardiogenic origins. 6.\tThere is no response to pain stimulus when in syncopal episodes. 7.\tHe does have the ability to \u2018pop out\u2019 of episodes to carry on 45 seconds of lucid conversation after which he returns to completely unconscious state with amnesia regarding the lucid conversation 8.\tEEG was run during syncopal episodes.  Negative results. 9.\tCT Scan was run.  Negative results. 10.\tEKG was run with computer generated note stating \u201c2 degree AV block\u201d, however, no other information was able to be gained. 11.\tEvent monitor was worn for a month.  NSR recorded for each syncopal event. 12.\tGreyhound pets seem to be able to sense onset of syncopal episodes even when he can\u2019t and bark persistently to alert him to find safe position 13.\tA tentative diagnosis of autonomic neuropathy was tossed about but shelved when he didn\u2019t have a significant number of other symptoms.  So, we\u2019re left with the problem where he\u2019s consistently \u2018passing out,\u2019 whether at home or in the hospital or on the way to the doctor\u2019s office.  Nobody has been able to tell us what to do or whether to consider each episode an emergency.  I would assume a blood pressure of 67/43 would be cause for alarm, but he\u2019s always come back out of it\u2026.after a period of time has passed\u2026so, we\u2019re not certain how to handle this.  I\u2019ve researched everything I can think of and seem to be coming up empty.  HELP!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Non-standard syncopal episodes",
    "content": "Dear Beth,  i hope your husband is doing better now and a cause was found for his syncope.  It sounds to me that your husband's cause of syncope is the low blood pressure and heart rate. The low blood pressure causes low blood flow to the brain and hence the loss of consciousness. Once the cause of low blood pressure and low heart rate is determined then the proper treatment will be given. However, you mentioned that in subsequent episodes, his heart rate was sinus and this implies that it was of normal rate as well. So, the low blood pressure is most probably the reason behind this.  It sounds also that the medication part has been eliminated as well but was there any correlation between nitroquick and your husband's episodes? How about the toprol which can cause both low blood pressure and heart rate?  Has he had an mra (mri with angiogram) of the brain and the brain vessels?  Having autonomic neuropathy can be the cause behind this especially if there is a correlation between it and your husband's episodes. It is usually managed by maintaining adequate blood volume by adequate fluid intake or medications such as fludrocortisone (and others). He can try those and see whether they are going to help.  i don't think there will be a need for the tilt table test as if it was positive, he would have been put on either a beta blocker (which he is already receiving) or other medications (such as theophylline-not many people use it) or increase salt in the diet (which can be done).  He had a very good work-up but this is syncope, a million dollar work-up and in many cases nothing is found.

    "content": "Sanjay,  Thanks for getting back to me,, Its good you don't lead a stressfull life, that will help against the problems u are going through, people who are easily stressed have a hyper sense of symptoms, in other words they are more aware of aches and pains. Although u say you are dtinking only two cups of tea and two cups of coffee a day this is still twice the daily reccemended ammount and beleive it or not cant contribute towards the problems and act as a catalyst for other things. I think at this stage I would reccemend that you consult you GP and explain what you have been experiencing and im sure he will run some test that will rule out certain cause. My reccemendation would be to have an ECG and routine Blood test to rule out underlying cardio problems.   I don't think u need to have to many concerns about this problem and im sure once you have consulted you GP and had certain tests done, assuming results come back ok, it should ease your mind which in turn should have a knock on effect on the symptoms.  Look forward to hearing from you Sanjay  Regards  Dr Meakin - DROCS\n\n",

    "content": "Dave, first off, slow down and breathe.    I can not and will not try and diagnose what is wrong with you; I\u2019ll start by saying that.  What I will tell you is that it sounds like there a fair level of anxiety going on here.  People tend to get kind of defensive when the label \u2018anxiety\u2019 is even suggested but it\u2019s really not warranted.  It is extremely common and can result in signs and symptoms that can very closely mimic other problems, it can be pretty crippling.  However one of the best things that anyone can do for it can be done by you; relaxing and focusing on your breathing.   A common misconception is that if you have your blood pressure taken and it\u2019s say 120/80 then it should always be 120/80 and any variation of that indicates a problem.  Well that is not the case.  Your vital signs fluctuate!  It depends on your activity level that particular day, what you\u2019ve had to drink, how many cigarettes you\u2019ve had, stress level at the time, and so on.  Same goes for your hear rate.  Obviously there are limits to what are acceptable highs and lows, but if you get the exact same BP and HR every time they\u2019re checked, it\u2019s little more than a coincidence.    The other two things that you mentioned that struck me was that you\u2019re taking ASA like it\u2019s candy.  ASA is an extremely common medication with many uses; it really is a remarkable little drug.  But it is a drug; it\u2019s not without its side effects and risks.  It\u2019s brutal on your stomach for one.  Be careful - take no more than what is recommended / prescribed!    The internet is a wonderful tool, but the more you read the more \u2018freaked out\u2019 you\u2019re going to get, and not everything on the net is all that credible, everything (even this) must be taken with a grain of salt.  DO NOT freak out!  It is absolutely not warranted right now OK?  See your family doctor tell him / her about the head aches, vision problems, etc.    Relax (I know I know easer said than done) and go see your family doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 30 yr old female whose father passed away at the age of 33 from an aortic aneurism.  I worry sometimes because I get pains on the left side that feel like if I breath any deeper or exhale any further then something may break.  When I stretch and arch my back, I hear and feel something crack right where my sternum is.  Lately I have been having trouble getting a deep enough breath and have been tested for asthma which is negative.  I also have a resting heart rate of 104 beats per minute.  I have asked doctors to check my heart before but they tell me since I am a female, its different than if I were a male.    I would appreciate any feedback.  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

If an aneurysym for example, in the abdomen, is usually noted on a physical exam and identified by diagnostic procedures such as CT scans, MRI's etc. A resting heart rate of 104 would be considered abnormal regardless of gender.

    "content": "I am curious if any of my symptoms are related to my heart.  about 7 mos ago i began having very bad neck pain every morning when i woke up.  shortly after, i began having dizzy spells with severe headaches.  The dizziness has more or less turned into cloudiness/feeling funny spells that 7 mos later are still occuring.  They will occur for a couple days at a time on and off, disappear and show up weeks later.  the headaches have been pretty constant, but do come and go as well, but thankfully are not as severe as they were initially.  a couple months after all that started, i began have joint pain throughout my body but most predominantly in my hands and wrists.  it almost feels like nerves are constantly firing in my hands, when it is at its worst.  But like all my other symtoms, this pain comes and goes. Currently it is better, but far from gone.  I have also been having heart burn more than usual.  Basically my body has been completely out of whack!  I have been to doctors and all my blood work has come back normal which is good, but nevertheless, my symptoms remain.  i am only 24 years old so the likelihood of a heart problems causing this probably isn't the case.  However,  I just want to be thorough, and am frustrated that we have found no answers.  it is worth mentioning i was on vioxx for a few months right before all this began.  if you have any advice as to what steps to take next, it is greatly appreciated!\n\n",

I have stopped and started all my medication over the past two months to assess there effects but none seem to instigage or exacipate the symptoms. these symptoms have got worse the last few days have you any idea as to the cause of these symptoms?\n\n",

That's a theory..... but at the same time...doctors shouldn't under estimate your SOB on exertion...just be persistent about it,ok? is it on minimal exertion ...how many metres can u walk before you get SOB?...because if it's minimal, then it' s ok and it's a matter of adjusting your heart medications and you'll be good to go.   one more thing... you should ask them to decrease your morphine dose and make it a combination of 2 powerful non-addictive pain killers,ok?   about phrenic nerve damage....it can be noticed during your routine chest x-ray... when you do a Chest x-ray...ask them about it ok?  and for hiatus hernia....do you have any stomach problems...?heart burn,acid reflux, stomach ache....before or after meals?!

    "title": "Questions about Heart Palpitations",
    "content": "Hi,  I would appreciate some advice on recent odd palpitations I have experienced. I have been reading alot of information online but of course would like a professional opinion.  Since Oct 2004 I have had a number of palpitations -- events where it felt like my heart was fluttering with a loss of breath. On average I have noticed them about once a week. Lately though in the past 2 days I have noticed 4 seperate events that last for about 5 seconds each. In November I had an EKG, Exercise Stress, Blood test (for over/under tyhroid) and 24 holter monitor. Sadly the day I had the holter I experinced none of these palpitations.   1. I was wondering if this could be some sort of arrythmia? I am worried as well since I have had chest pain which of course is atypical since it does NOT accompany these palpitations or exercise. I am male, 22 years old 132 lbs and 5'8, in pretty good physical shape.  2. Also, do you think I should go back to get additional tests done, perhaps a Echo looking for MVP?   I had an Echo done when I was 18 but the doctor did not find anything wrong. (This test was preformed since I encountered jaw and throat pain whenever I was extremely active in cold weather -- and still do today, perhaps exercise induced asthma).  I appreciate your response and have learnt much going through this forum recently.   Thanks alot,  fth\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Jerjonjoe,  It sounds like you may have pleurisy, this occurs when the double membrane (pleura) that lines the chest cavity and surrounds each of your lungs becomes inflamed. The signs of pleurisy are severe chest pain that starts suddenly and is often strong or stabbing when you take a deep breath. It usually subsides or disappears between breaths. It's usually felt on one side of the chest. Deep breathing and coughing often make it worse. You may have a fever, pain when moving, or fast, shallow breathing. Typically, you will be able to point to the exact location of the pain. In some people, the pain spreads to the neck, shoulder, or abdomen.  If this sounds like what you have, you may need antibiotics but until you can get to the doctors \u2026 when you cough, hold a pillow against your chest. Lie on the side that hurts, drink plenty of water, and use a humidifier to keep moisture in the air but keep it clean \u2013 you don\u2019t need fungus growing in your lungs.  If this doesn\u2019t sound like what you have, it could be something much worse. If the symptoms seem to get worse, call your Physician!\n\n",

    "content": "I''m a 35 year old male. I smoke 1/2 pack a day (I know I have to quit). for the last 6 years 've  run 15k a week and weight train 3-4 times a week. I take multi-vitamins and eat fairly healthy.  About 3 months ago I experienced swelling in the back of my head, just behind both of my ears. It eventually went away after 2-3 weeks. Then about 1 month ago, I woke up one morning not feeling to well. I went outside to clean some snow and then tried to do some weight training. I could not finish the workout as I felt light headed and short of breath. I then experienced a full blown attack of some sort. Symptoms included Chest discomfort, weakness, nausea, dizziness, tingling in arms and legs and shortness of breath.   I went to ER and was their for 3 hours where I received a chest x-ray, 3 Electrocardiograms from ECG, and blood test. I was released as the test came back normal. Doctor beleived I had a Chest spasm.   It has been 1 month and everytime I try and workout all of these symptoms return and it feels like something(heart attack?) will happen. The symptoms are extremely intense and  last about 5-10 minutes and subside, but I still generally don't feel well.  I have not worked out in 2 weeks now and I still feel tightness in my left chest that runs to my shoulder and upper jaw. At times I do feel tingling in my left arm. I am having trouble sleeping and at times feel anxious.  I went to see my doctor as well who did some general tests like checking  my breathing and that he would be concerned if the chest discomfort was in the middle of the chest. He also said since an ECG and chest x-ray were done it should rule out your heart.   I'm not sure what or where to go from here. Thankyou for your time.\n\n",

The probability that this pain be due to coronary disease is intermediate.  i think that a stress test at this point is not something unreasonable to think about, however, i am not sure how you are going to have a meaningful stress test if every time you exercise you develop these symptoms. You could have a chemical stress test but i think it is best to have an treadmill exercise stress test.  These could also be symtoms of a panic attack.

    "content": "Dear Wallbreaker,  Females of child bearing age are naturally protected against coronary disease. You don't have any major risk factors for coronary disease and the chest pain is atypical as compared to that of coronary disease.   Obviously, I cannot rule out something as dangerous as a cardiac cause for your chest pain over the internet, but according to your description this chest pain is probably not secondary to coronary disease.  Chest pain could be related to a heart condition called mitral valve prolapse which is diagnosed by ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) and needs to be followed. i would recommend that you have an echocardiogram to exclude this condition.  Other causes include chest wall pain such as muscle spasms and inflammation of the cartilages of the ribs of the chest wall. Acid reflux disease can give rise to chest pain as well. Neck problems can give rise to chest pain as well.  Regarding the jaw pain or the teeth pain, it can be either the cause of the chest pain (i.e. pain originating from the jaw and referred to the chest) or the chest pain could be the cause of the teeth pain (i.e. pain originating from the chest and referred to the jaw). i recommend that you be evaluated by your dentist if not already done.

I have a couple of symptoms that are unexplained by my doctors.  I have burning in my chest and arm, which occurs often and when at rest.  I have no symptoms when exercising or walking etc.  It's only when sitting or lying down.  I've had chest x-rays, EKGs, blood enzyme tests, blood test for folic acid, and an ultrasound of my kidneys and cartoroid arteries, all of which have all been normal.  I have changed my daily habits since being diagnosed with high BP.  I've lost weight, my cholesteral is optimal, I exercise routinely, eat a healthy diet.  I do not have upset stomachs -- so I don't think this is caused by acid reflux.  I had several emergency room visits 6 months ago when I was first diagnosed with high BP -- could my burning arm & chest be the result of a reaction to that stress or a side effect of my blood pressure medication?  My doctor thinks it's a pulled muscle, but since burning is a cardiac symptom in women and since I have a strong genetic predisposition I'm concerned and anxious about it.  Are there any additional tests that I should ask my doctor to prescribe?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Gambino90,  You have one major risk factor for coronary disease and that is high blood pressure which you have not had for long. You are fairly young and still in the child bearing age (where hormones still protect women against coronary disease). The characteristics of your chest pain are atypical as compared to chest pain of coronary disease. So, the probability of this pain be due to coronary disease is very low.  Other causes for this chest pain could be: 1. Acid reflux disease. Acid reflux has nothing to do with having an upset stomach and if you have burning in your chest, this could be due to acid reflux. So, i recommend that you try an over the counter anti-acids to see whether they are going to help.  By the way, burning in the chest is not a hallmark of heart disease (whether in men or women). The chest pain has to fulfill other characteristics to be diagnosed as chest pain of heart (coronary) origin. Burning in the chest is just not enough to diagnose heart disease. 2. Neck spine problems. Especially that you have burning in your arm as well. i recommend that you have a neck x-ray/ct scan to exclude neck spine problems. 3. Your chest pain could be a stress reaction but personally i don't like to attribute any symptom to stress or anxiety till i am absolutely sure that it is not due to physical causes. 4. As regards to the possibility of these symptoms being caused by your medications. These specific symptoms were not mentioned as part of the side effect profiles of either plendil or lisinopril. If either medication causes hypotension, chest pain (caused by inadequate blood flow) amongst other symptoms might ensue.

On top, you had normal ecg and blood tests (which i assume are cardiac enzymes) while having the pain and this is also an indication that the pain is not due to coronary disease.  Unless you use cocaine in addition to Marijuana, it is a very remote possibility that this pain is due to coronary disease.  From your description, the pain could be related to chest wall causes such as muscles spasms or inflammaiton of the chest wall as inflammation of the cartilages of the ribs.  i recommend that you try over the counter anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen and the like to see whether it is going to help.

    "content": "Hello, recently I have had chest pain.  Months ago I would have an occassional stabbing pain that would last a couple seconds, make it hard to breath and go away.  My Dr. had noticed a skipping beat and had me wear a monitor and ordered me to have an ultrasound on my heart.  Apparently those were normal.  I asked the nurse doing my ultrasound what the stabbing pain was and she said perhaps a spasm.  Sometimes I have chest pain when it's in the middle of my upper back, they most of the time go to gether.  This time it has been a little over a week.  Months ago when I was having the pain I was also waking up in the middle of the night with sharp pains.  I do also have IBS, and just below the ribs on the left I'll occassionally get what my Dr. calls \"trapped air\".  I can take a deep breath and it sounds like a frog in there.  I have this currently with my chest pain and have had other abdominal pains that I am assuming are related to my IBS.  Also I was told that I have 2 ulcers, but don't recall them telling me where they were.  Do you have any suggestions?  Thank you for your time.  I might want to add that with my regular IBS symptoms this time I am having upper abdominal pain, rather sharp.\n\n",

    "content": "I am almost 14 years old and am 95 pounds, not being overweight for my height. I eat normally, that is 2-3 fastfood meals a week more or less. I don't know how my blood pressure or anything is. I don't smoke.   For about four years i've breen experiencing chest pains. At first I had this ache in my chest, I can't remember what side it was on, but it was always there. I don't remember everything, but I remember once I was running for ten minutes without a rest and my chest was hurting so much I thought it was going to explode, but it could have been a cramp. I think the pain often went away with rest. Don't dwell on this though, pay more attention to my resent symptoms.   I used to get sharp, stabbing chest pains that occured every once in a long while. These went away, but now I have them almost daily. I get aches in my chest that stay for a few minutes or a few hours. The aches never radiate from one place to another, they are always either on the left side, the right side or the middle. More often on the right (the side my hearts not on, Im not sure if that really is the right). They can be on my lower ribcage, midcage, or behind my breastbone. These aches happen at any time, but often they seem to be brought on by strong emotion. When they are brought on by emotion they are usually in the right side of my chest. I also get back pains a lot. The pain comes from deep inside my back, and it usually comes when im stressed. Sometimes there is pain in my arm or shoulder. One day I thought I had a heart attack because stabbing pains were stricking one after another and there was ache everywhere that wouldn't go away. Ocassionally, my heart seems to skip a beat.   Can anyone tell me what is causing this.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your information Yasser. I have an update. The pains are different now. I was laying in bed in the middle of the night and suddenly this very intense stabbing pain shot down from my shoulder all the way to my hip, stricking everywhere on the left side including my arm. It happened 2 or 3 times in the same minute. From then on my chest was rather sore all day. There were aches, a burning sensation and little stabbing pains everywhere on my chest. I found that if I misaged certain parts the pain would SOMETIMES go away. I also flopped down on the couch and when my back hit the couch it sent stabbing pain down me again, and when I took a breath it produced pain. It was all like that today and this all hasn't gone away since. Is there anything else it could be? The way the pain occured as I hit the back of the couch seems to me that it isn't a heart problem. But im suspicous of the burning. Could it be possible that I have angina? I've heard that lots of young people get that.   The pain is very intense, and its getting on my nerves. I went to see the docter and the dumb guy said it was growing pains\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sean,  i am no expert by any means but here are my thoughts.  You don't have any major risk factors for coronary disease (or at least you never mentioned any). Your chest pain is atypical as compared to that of coronary disease. So, the probability that your chest pain be due to coronary disease is very low.  The causes of chest pain are various and in addition to coronary disease, there is another heart condition called mitral valve prolapse which is known to cause atypical chest pain and palpitations. This condition is quite common in the younger population. It is diagnosed by an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiography) and needs to be followed-up. If you have an echocardiogram and it proves you have this condition, there are medications that can be used in this case to help you with the chest pain and the palpitations.  Your chest pain could just be a way of expression for the palpitations that you have been having.  Neck spine problems can cause chest pain. So, i suggest that you have a neck x-ray or ct scan to exclude neck spine problems.  In addition to acid reflux disease for which you are taking ranitidine (and by the way this is not the strongest medication for acid reflux disease) and inflammation in the chest wall or musculoskeletal causes (for which you are taking pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medications), another cause is panic attacks.  You could also try a small dose of a tranquilizer unless aupam is a tranquilizer that i am not familiar with.  So, i recommend that you have: 1. An echocardiogram to rule out mitral valve prolapse.  2. A 24 hours heart monitor and blood tests for thyroid functions and electrolytes if chest pain is the way your palpitations are being expressed. 3. A neck x-ray or ct scan to rule out neck problems. 4. May be starting a small dose tranquilizer if you are not already on one (aupam). 5. May be switch to an acid inhibitor stronger than ranitidine.

    "content": "For the past week or so I have been having odd tingling and pressure sensations in my left arm and leg - sometimes also in my left breast/chest. I was worried about it, so I went to the doctor. They took my blood pressure - 140/90 about (they said it was borderline high). Then, the doctor simply squeezed my left arm and leg in different areas asking if it hurt...it didn't. Now, let me give you the info I gave my doctor - since the only other thing he did was ask a few questions:  -Male, 26 -5'10\", 205lbs -Smoke about one pack a day of cigarettes (I know, I know. I'm down to 4 or 5 a day now) -Drink maybe 8 alcoholic drinks per week. -2 to 4 cups of coffee per day (also cut back - down to 1) -Not much exercise (I know, I know...) -No \"street drugs\" -Not on any prescription drugs.  Now, the doctor did only the things I mentioned (no tests, no workup, etc.) and concluded that my lifestyle is to blame...which is great as far as cause, but not much of a diagnosis. He told me to stop the things I was doing and it should go away in a couple weeks. I then told him that I would like something to help with the discomfort now(it isn't painful...just annoying and odd feeling). So, he prescribed Elavil - an anti-depressant/sleeping agent which also works on \"Nerve Pain\" - which is what he suspects.   Here's my question: Given my symptoms and info, does the exam I received seem sufficient? Should I be scheduling another appointment and demanding further testing (Kaiser doesn't just offer these things...)? The appointment was last Friday (5 days ago) and I have had no change. These symptoms are almost non-existant in the morning and progress throughout the day. Bottom line: I'm scared of anything that could signal stroke or heart attack and my HMO is not making diagnosis easy. Any advice?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear tdinsfb,  A heart attack in a 26 years old is very rare but not unheard of.  Tingling in the left side of the chest is not a typical symptom of a heart attack.  You have some risk factors of coronary disease as you pointed very well in your post. Allow me to add that a positive family history for heart attacks is very important as well (something that you don't have).  You have to stop smoking and drinking, exercise more and reach an ideal body weight (if possible).  Putting in mind that i am not a neurologist, tingling in the arms and legs (generally speaking of course), can sometimes represent a symptom of stroke.  My suggestion is to watch it for now. In case it gets any worse, i think you should go to your doctor to be worked up.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

Don't bother with this reading. Take your blood pressure two more times on two different days during this week. If all three readings are high, then you are hypertensive and need to be treated for high blood pressure.

    "title": "Respectfully request a physician's opinion-what could it be?",
    "content": "I recently wrote regarding numbness and tingling in my left arm and a pain which radiated from the chest, to the arm down to the fingers, to the jaw, and, amazingly, a pain in the back of my head too. My legs were always getting numb at night but I never connected the two and, to be honest, was pretty cavalier about my problem even though I have all the risk factors for heart disease. (including a father who died at 41 of heart disease.  I am 40)  After I posted I was admitted to the hospital, received a stress test, nitro, lopressor (which had my heart beat down to 80 from the previous 104) and various blood tests and a chest x-ray.  Though I never saw a cardiologist he did read the stress test and I was discharged.  I do not know the results of the testing but I assume that they are okay if I was discharged.  The numbness is back and I will admit, I have great concerns about this.  I thought I was okay after I was cleared for the cardiac problems but I have the numbness in the legs when I wake in the morning, the arm numbness is still there all the way down to my fingers (left arm) and occasionally, I have a pain in the chest that stops me in my tracks.  When I say numbness I mean a loss of sensation or feeling different than the other leg at the time or the  arm at the time, whichever the case may be. I am still able to walk though I am aware of the difference.  It feels as if my leg/legs are asleep.  I have called a physician to make an appointment and refer me for tests. (though I have no idea what kind)  In the meanwhile I would llike some reassurance (being a new patient I have to wait several weeks to see a doctor) that this isn't a preview to a stroke or IS a cardiac problem.   I just want to know if and when to go to the ER.  I don't want to be complacent and just ignore these symptoms but I also don't want to waste anyone's time running back and forth to the ER if there is nothing wrong with me.  Other than those symptoms I have nothing of concern going on with the exception of three fatty tumors on my back and side (was told what they were in the ER) and a very low tolerance for heat.  I can't function at all when it's hot, over and above what a normal person can take. Haven't had any injury with the exception of a brown recluse spider bite last spring and I take no medications at all.  Could these symptoms be neurological or is it, as the er room doctor thought, maybe a pinched nerve?  I'm supposed to go out 80 miles offshore for tuna fishing next month, in a boat with two other men, and don't relish the thought of having a stroke iin the middle of the ocean, that far from help. Any foundation for my concerns?  Thank you, in advance, for any help you may give.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Request a physician's opinion-what could it be?",
    "content": "Dear John,  You have three major risk factors for coronary disease: a strong positive family history for coronary disease (your father dying of a heart attack at 41), gender (male) and smoking. Your chest pain has some atypical features to it. The probability of this pain be due to coronary disease is intermediate. Your strong positive family history would drive some doctors to rule coronary disease even though your chest pain is atypical.   Was the stress test that you had an exercise test or chemical test? If it was an exercise stress test, how long did you stay on the treadmill? How high did your heart rate go? Why was the exercise test stopped? Did you have any chest pain at any time during the test?  If it was an exercise stress test, the longer you stayed on the treadmill, the less chance that this is coronary disease. If your heart rate reached the maximum predicted heart rate for your age and you did not have any chest pain and the stress test turned out negative, then this is a good indication that this is not coronary disease.  Your chest pain with the numbness in the legs has more atypical features to it than typical features. i think with this numbness in both your arms and legs, you ought to have your spine evaluated.   There is nothing wrong with going to the er if you think you need to go. i think a better thing is to know why you are going, meaning, you need to have an accurate diagnosis. If the chest pain proved not to be due to coronary disease, what is it caused by?  In addition, you have to stop smoking now, be checked for high cholesterol and lose weight and be active. If this chest pain is not due to coronary disease, this does not mean that your risk of coronary went down, it is still the same. i encourage you to start leading a healthier life.  Make sure to ask your doctor whether or not it is safe to go on that fishing trip.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "title": "Re: Palpitations",
    "content": "Dear jcoulter22,  Palpitations is the sensation of feeling your heart beats.  Normally we do not feel our hearts beating because they beat in a regular fashion (rhythm and rate) and we are accustomed to the strength of the beat so it does not disturb us.  If there is a change in the strength or any irregularity of the heart rhythm or change in the heart rate (whether racing or slowing), then we will start feeling our heart beating.  Palpitations can be caused by: 1. An overactive thyroid gland. 2. Electrolytes disturbance. 3. Mitral valve prolapse. 4. Smoking. 5. Drinking alcohol. 6. Drinking too much caffeinated beverages. 7. Not getting enough sleep. 8. Stress.  i suggest that you have an electrocardiogram (electrical drawing of the heart) to see whether or not the palpitations will appear on it. If not then a 24 hours heart monitor is not a bad idea to try and record the palpitations that you have and know which type it is to be able to give you the correct treatment.  i suggest a blood test for thyroid gland and electrolytes. To have an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart) to rule out the presence of mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse is a heart condition found in otherwise healthy young adults who usually complain of palpitations and atypical chest pain. It only needs to be followed.  You have to stop smoking and drinking alcohol and caffeinated beverages if you are. You have to try and have enough sleep and rest. These measures help a lot with the symptoms.  Keep us posted on how your appointment with your doctor turns out.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "I'm a 53 y.o. male and I have started having very bad dull aching pain in my shoulders and upper chest just below my collar bones. The pain seems worse on the left side but when its at its worst it is in both shoulders and radiates down into my arms all the way to my forearms. Strange thing is this isn't brought on by activity such as excercise or movement and I have actually noticed that taking several deep breaths seems to ease the pain somewwhat. I only got about 4 hrs sleep last night due to this and the symptoms didn't start until I had gone to bed. When it did let up it would come back just as I was dosing off and would remain several minutes. It comes in waves and there is no central point of the pain. It starts mild and gets increasingly more severe, then slowly eases up. It is a radiating and as best as I can describe a sqeezing type pain. It started a couple of weeks ago ,went away a few days and has now been a daily occurance for the last 4 days. I had an acute pericarditis attack back in 1983 and was in icu for 5 days. The Doctotors at that time thought it was probably viral but unsure. Mornings and night seem to be the worst but it can happen at anytime.    Thanks for any advise on this problem. rog1951\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Shannon,  To be able to judge whether or not this chest pain might be due to coronary disease, major risk factors for coronary disease and the characterisitics of the chest pain (as compared to those of the chest pain caused by coronary disease) have to be assessed and then the probability of this pain being due to coronary disease is determined.  i am not sure about your major risk factors for coronary disease, what did you do regarding your high blood pressure? Have you ever checked it again?  How about when you do any kind of exercise? How long does the pain usually last? Do you have any other symptoms in addition to the shortness of breath?  The best thing to do is to be checked out by a health care professional for this chest pain the first time you get chest pain.  If you live in a mid-sized or bigger town, most probably there will be some free clinics affiliated with religious organizations, i suggest that you try and find one around.

Even though it does not sound typical of acid reflux disease, sometimes, acid reflux disease can give rise to strange symptoms including chest, neck and back pain.  i recommend that chest pain be evaluated by a health care professional at least once. If you don't have insurance and if you live in a mid sized town, most probably, there will be a free clinic where you can go and be evaluated and they are usually affiliated with hospitals who are affiliated with religious organizations such as churches.

Your chest pain is atypical as compared to that of coronary disease. So, the probability of this pain being due to coronary disease is very low.

    "content": "I wrote about a month back about symptoms that I thought were heart-related but kept getting told by the doctor that it was GERD. The last time I went to the doctor's he listened to my heart again and said that it was beating fast and he refered me to a cardiologist. Went to see cardiologist and he said that yes my heart was beating fast and that he thought I had a stomach ulcer. He said that he didn't think it was heart related. But he had me wear the 24-hour holter monitor. Went back for the results last week and he told me that he had found some abnormalities and that he wanted to do more tests for structural heart disease and angina - I am now terrified that I have something seriously wrong with my heart. I am scheduled to have an echocardiogram and a treadmill test this Thursday and then I won't get to see the cardiologist until a week later. I had an endoscopy and they found some acid in my stomach - now taking medicine for that. My worry is the palpitations - yesterday I had a very scary incident where I went to the supermarket after walking up five flights of stairs and suddenly I had a pain on the left side of my chest and I couldn't even bear my shirt to touch my chest. I was also sweating. I didn't have the palpitations on that occasion. Does this sound like angina or something else? I can walk up the stairs without palpitations in the morning, but in the afternoon they appear. The cardiologist hasn't prescribed any medicine so far and I am so worried that I am about to have a heart attack. How likely is it that I have angina?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Need advice,  Thank you very much for the update.  By now, i think that you already had the echocardiogram and the stress test and about or just saw your cardiologist.  How did you do on the treadmill? How long did you stay on the treadmill and what is the maximum that your heart reached? Did you have any chest pain? Why was the test terminated? Were you told that the ekg was normal during the stress test? Anything the echo tech told you about the echo? Was there mitral valve prolapse?  The probability of this chest pain be due to coronary disease is still very low. You are in a female in the child bearing age. You don't have any major risk factors for coronary disease. Your chest pain is atypical. My prediction is that your stress test is most probably going to be normal.  If everything turns out normal (the echo and all), i recommend that you have a neck x-ray/ct scan to rule out neck spine problems.

I then went back to the doctor for the results of the echo and treadmill - should have mentioned that I am from England but I am currently teaching in South Korea - bascially he said he couldn't find anything in the two tests so he went back to the EKG and now he is convinced I have WPW syndrome and Atrial Fibrilation. He said i was being sent to the main cardiologist for EPS and they would do an abalation. Of course I totally freaked out and my parents were on their way here - he had said it was fatal, so I was thinking that I was about to drop down dead at any moment. Saw the most senior cardiologist in Korea yesterday and he looked at the results and said that he thought that such an arrythmia in a young person is nothing to worry about. He hooked me up to the 24 hour holter again last night and I have to go back for the results on Monday.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Need advice,  Thank you very much for the update.  Those must have been some horrifying few days till you met the cardiologist.  wpw (Wolff-Parkinson-White) syndrome is not  a fatal disease. There is of course some potential fatality in any disease but i don't think that this was the way to tell you so.   wpw is a condition where there is an abnormal electrical accessory pathway (connection) between the upper chambers of the heart, called atria (where the electrical impulses of the heart normally arise) and the lower chambers of the heart, called ventricles (that pump that blood to the lungs and body). If this pathway is functioning, which it is not in many cases, the electrical impulses of the heart pass through it from the atria to the ventricles in a shorter time interval. Normally, when the electrical impulse passes through the normal electrical pathway, there is a normal delay in passing the impulse from the atria to the ventricles which in a way protects the heart from very fast heart rates.  If it so happens that a person with wpw has a functioning pathway and develops an abnormally fast heart rate, all these fast impulses are going to be delivered without delay from the atria to the ventricles and this means that the heart will, in some cases, not have the time to fill with blood and hence no blood is pumped and the patient loses consciousness and if the arrhythmia does not brake by itself or the patient treated immediately, then death might happen. This happens very rarely. The incidence of suden death was 0 - 0.4% in several large case studies. If the patient is asymptomatic, never had any arrhythmias before, the incidence is virtually non-existent.  Having atrial fibrillation with wpw is not a good thing, because with atrial fibrillation, abnormally irrgular fast electrical impulses arise from the atria at a rate of 300 or more per minute, normally, 150-200 are only delivered to the ventricles in case of normal conduction. But, in cases of wpw, and with no delay in conduction, all of them reach the ventricles and then the heart could stop. i am sure that is why, when you doctor thought that you had wpw with atrial fibrillation, he told that it is a fatal condition and set you up immediately with the cardiologist.  Did the cardiologist tell you that you really have wpw and atrial fibrillaiton or what was his diagnosis.  Some patients describe palpitations (their feeling of their heart beating in a fashion that they are not accustomed to as chest pain and this could be what is happening to you here. You are getting palpitations and you are feeling it as chest discomfort or pain.  Regarding palpitations and especially in young healthy persons, please feel free to go through some of the posts here in the cardiology forum that dealt with this issue, and if you still have any questions or concerns, i will be more than happy to answer them. Start with this post.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

He said that I did not have it and that the machine at the other hospital could have been faulty. He did however say that he had found two arrthymias - one  SV Tach that lasted for 5 beats and one V tach that lasted for 4 beats. He said that while the V tach is normally dangerous, due to a lack of abnormalities in my heart and because my heart is structurally ok, these beats will not hurt me. He advised me to lose weight, cut out caffeine and to cut down on alcohol. He didn't prescribe any anti-arrythmia medicine but he did give me some medicine to slow down my heartbeat. He said to go back in a month.\n\n",

    "title": "Dizzy when I tilt my head back",
    "content": "I am a 25 year old male. I do not exercise though I have been thinking about doing some running. I rarely drink, I don't smoke, I don't drink caffeine. In fact the past couple of months I have been drinking almost nothing but water.        A couple of months ago started getting very dizzy when I would tilt my head back or when I would lay down and roll side to side. I also had a ringing in my left ear at one point and some pressure directly in front of my left ear.  This lasted for about 18 hours, when I went to see a doctor he told me it was probably a viral ear infection and not to worry about it. To be specific the dizziness was a feeling like I would fall over and not a feeling of motion. Anyway the dizziness has not happened since but a couple of days later I started getting some chest pain. It was dull and sort of localized to the center of my chest. This would come and go and again I would try not to worry about it, though sometimes I did freak a little. This lasted maybe three weeks off and on. I also was getting a swelling feeling in my throat sometimes. It never seriously interfered with breathing or swallowing but it made it a bit more difficult to swallow at times, this has been an occasional problem even currently.         One night about a month ago I felt my heart beating very hard and fast and my right arm was a little numb. I was pretty freaked out by this and went to the doctor in the morning. They did an EKG and took some blood and checked my red and white blood cells and my hemoglobin as well as some other stuff. Anyway it was all normal. I went to another doctor and got some other blood tests inluding checking my thyroid and everything was normal except for my Bilirubin which is 2.3. If you need to know all of the blood results I will type them but there is a lot.         I have had continuing problems with the palpitations. I notice that I get them almost every morning when I wake up and they seem to come and go randomly whether I am sitting watching tv or out walking around. My arm still gets a little numb on occasion and it is almost always my right arm, though it was in both one time. I have felt some fatigue off and on for about a month now. Also on what I would imagine is a completely unrelated note I chronically get hemorrhoids and have off and on for probably 5 years. Sometimes there is some bright red blood on the toilet paper and sometimes it hurts a bit but it has never been bad enough to get me into a doctor for it. I do have one now and there has been blood on the toilet paper but none in the toilet. Anyway they come and go and while a pain in the backside I don't worry about them. That is all the symptoms I can think of but I will update if I remember more. Anyway I am aware that this could just be anxiety and/or depression and I am willing to consider both since I have been out of college for over a year now and I am still unable to find a job and am living with my parents again. However I have certainly felt more anxiety in the past as well as being more depressed before with no symptoms. In fact I would say the main source of anxiety right now is these symptoms which lately I have not really worried about at all. I do not have health insurance and have already spent too much on blood tests and doctor visits and now I have been told to see a cardiologist. I really can't afford to do this Any advice expecially from a doctor would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "First I would like to thank you for replying. The palpitations I speak of are just a fast hard heart beat. As if I just ran a mile except I've done nothing strenuous at all. Sometimes if I'm laying down and have something sitting on my chest I can actually see it thumping up and down. At times my heart rate may seem a little abnormal, though I don't know how much variation is normal to begin with. It will be beating fast and then slow for a few beats and then speed up again. I had thought about acid reflux and was taking maalox whenever I had the chest pain. It never helped but then I was freaking a bit when I was getting that so who knows. Anyway I havn't had the chest pain in about a month now.   Could the high bilirubin have anything to do with this or is that something totally unrelated. My doctor didn't seem concerned with it. Also what do you mean by a neck problem. Could it be something as simple as sleeping in a weird position or something. I do recall my neck feeling stiff the night that I got the dizziness. And as I said I have been getting a swelling feeling in my throat. The numb arm mainly only happened that one night that I was having the bad palpitations. It has occured a couple of times since then but never as serious. I think its been 2 or 3 weeks since I've noticed it happening. The only thing now is that it just seems like my arms go to sleep a little more easily. If I hold an arm over my head in any weird position it goes to sleep pretty quick which it never used to do.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mahart,  Thank you very much for the update.  Maalox could not be strong enough to neutralize the acid, but since you have not had the chest pain in a while now, no need to use anything else.  A neck problem is a problem of the cervical spine such as a prolapsed disc. i don't think you have to worry about this new symptom of your hands being numb faster than they used to.  If these palpitations continue, in addition to having the echocardiogram to rule out mitral valve prolapse, i suggest a 24 hours heart monitor to know exactly what type of arryhthmias you have and what is their pattern and how long they last and what activities are related to them (if any).

Begun getting chest pains at 18, after a constant run of chest pain for a few hours on one occasion, went to the emergency room. Done an ECG.  Didn;t find anything. They said sometimes young women experience chest pain under the left breast and said it was unexplained as to why.  At 23 I experienced my first onset of palpitations. I had just got out of the shower and was getting ready to go to work. The thump was so hard you could literally see my chest pounding without touching it. I felt like I was going to pass out & die.  Called an ambulance, but 20 minutes later it had stopped.(so was not caught on ECG)  6 weeks later it happened again. This time while I was at work.  Did full blood tests, holter monitor and echocardiogram. Holter monitor showed ectopic heartbeats.  Was diagnosed with Anxiety & Panic Disorder.  Was given noten, aropax, valium, xanax  Had a bad reaction to the medications, so I went off all of them, and conquered the battle of nerves naturally. (did a lot of research on anxiety &panic)   One symptom never left, and that was the palpitations. Most of the time by the time I would get to the emergency room it would stop.  But around 7 months ago, on one of the trips to the emergency room I still had the palpitations. I didn't wait around, and got my husband to drive me up there quickly.  When I got there and they put the ECG on I had a heart rate of 240bpm (wasn't doing any physical activity at the time to bring it on, nor smoking or drinking, I just coughed and that's when it started)  They got me to try some of the natural methods to stop it, but after trying them, my heart rate went to 270bpm.   Was given a shot of adensine (horrible feeling by the way) and put back on the noten. Was actually kind of a relief to get back on the noten, at least I could sleep at night without my heart thumping out of my chest.  Was then diagnosed with SVT  It's been recommended that I have the electrical studies done to eliminate it.  If I don't have the noten on time, I usually get a lot of ectopic beats & palpitations  Sorry this is so long, but wanted you to know everything.  My questions are, if you could possibly answer me, and I'd be greatly thankful  1. Everywhere I read on SVT, it says I shouldn't be experiencing it so often (I can't seem to escape the constant thumps in my chest without the medication & taking it on time) so could there be something else causing this?  2. If I do the electro studies, will it also eliminate the ectopic heart beat as well?  3. How can I tell the difference between whether it might of been anxiety or a SVT? I'm not generally an anxious person, not after the material I've read and the understanding I have on it. But I do feel anxious when I get palpitations (mostly because it feels like I'm about to pass out, my vision goes a bit funny)  4. I've also been getting chest pain, not regularly, but generally once every couple of weeks, its on the left hand side of my chest, comes on suddenly, takes my breath away and then leaves my left arm feeling dead (sort of like when you get a blood test done, and they put the band around your arm to cut/slow down your blood circulation) that type of feeling. The pain only lasts around 10 seconds, and the dead arm feeling usually lasts around 30 to 60 minutes. Could this be related to SVT? Or should it be something of concern? If so, what would your thoughts be?  Thanks in Advance\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Diagnosed with svt & ectopic beats",
    "content": "Dear Joesy,  The palpitations that you are experiencing could be ectopic beats and not necessarily svts. But, a-v nodal re-entry tachycardia can be triggered by ectopic beats.  Elimination of the svts does not necessarily mean that the ectopic beats will be gone as they might be of ventricular origin.   i think if the palpitations start and then you start to be anxious, this is svt, but if you start to feel that you are anxious or panicky and then start to have the palpitations, this is a panic attack. Having the sensation that you are about to faint and having a funny vision means that most probably you have a very fast heart rate and that there is not enough blood going to your brain.  Regarding the chest pain, females of the child bearing age who don't have any major risk factors for coronary disease are naturally protected against coronary disease. You are a smoker and don't have any other major risk factors for coronary disease and your chest pain is atypical as compared to that of coronary disease, so the probability of this chest pain be due to coronary disease is very low. Unless the pain is felt while you are feeling the palpitations, most propbably it is related to the svt. i can not really tell what is the cause behind the chest pain. i would recommend that you have a neck x-ray/ct scan to make sure that there is no neck problem given the arm feeling that you get.  i suggest that you go ahead and have the electrophysiologic studies which is going to be diganostic as well as therapeutic.  Please, stop smoking once and for all. Stopping smoking for 6 weeks is not enough for its effect on the heart and vessel to wear off, it takes much longer than that. Also, please, stop drinking as well.  Going up stairs is an exercise and it is normal for the heart rate to go up during exercise.

    "title": "Hard Heart Beats & Palpitation",
    "content": "Here is the story. Originally I was diagnosed with Long QT when I was like 10, from then on I drank Atenolol usually 50mg a day.  In Spring 2004, my doctor asked to stop drinking atenelol, since Long QT was not detected was several years. I stoped, after 2 months, I suddently started having fast/hard heart beat and lots of palpitations. I started taking atenolol again, everything became worse. Like 20 pulpantations a day. I went to the doctor, EKG, they couldn't find anything. Over the summer I figured out how to lower my heart beats and palptations. -- I noticed that I have faster heart beats and more pulpantations when I drink something caffeine or sugar or eat sugar related or fatty foods. Over the months, pulpantations reduced a lot, heart beat slowed down and was not so hard anymore. Then in Sept i went to another doctor, he took my EKG, nothing, he told lets put a monitor, I got the monitor from a company, where they come and put this PDA monitor, and it automatically detects irregular heart beats or I can report them my self. After 2 weeks, after I had all these weird palpitations, and even when I reported manually (it used sattelite to report), the doctor said, there was nothing.  Right now I only have palpitations when I eat something sweet or caffeine. (Thought Diet Pepsi Caffeine Free causes problems, even Caffeine Free coffee causes problems) If I avoid those things and eat healthy foods like vegetables and fruits, meat I seem not to have problems.   Additional Info: I haven't 100% confirmed from what this happens but usually this is what happens: Caffeine: Slower, not hard beat, palpintations, rought sounding beat, not clear, like when u sip soda with a straw but the straw is on top of the water, doctors could not detect it, even when I had it.   Sweets/not natural: Faster heart beats, still lower than 100, but very hard, and sometimes palpintations.   Blood pressure: I measured my blood pressure when I have these harder beats, its normal. Usually around 120/and less than 70.   I am 22/m, no allergies.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Slingxshot,  Is your doctor an electrophysiologist (cardiologist specialized in arrhythmias)?  If not, i suggest that you be seen and followed up by one.  A long qt syndrome is a condition in which dangerous arrhythmias might airse.  You have to be seen by an electrophysiologist to be cleared, to make sure that the long qt syndrome is gone or it still persists.  For the time being, i think you are doing a great job by trying to limit your caffeine intake and any other substance that might cause increase in the palpitations. If you develop palpitations, i advise you to contact your doctor or go to the emergency department to have an electrocardiogram at the time of the palpitation to determine what kind of arrhythmia of you have.

    "title": "Re: Abnormal heart beats",
    "content": "Dear Gemini1978,  Palpitations is the sensation of feeling of one's heart beats.  Normally we do not feel our hearts beating because they beat in a regular fashion (rhythm and rate) and we are accustomed to the strength of the beat so it does not disturb us.  If there is a change in the strength or any irregularity of the heart rhythm or change in the heart rate (whether racing or slowing), then we will start feeling our heart beating.  A normal heart rate is 60-100. Slower than 60 and higher than 100 is considered abnormal rate. One's heart rate is not constant all the time. If you check your pulse and you find it is 72/minute, this does not mean that it has to be 72 when you check it in another half an hour or the next minute for that matter. As long as it is within the normal range, there should be no problem. Heart rhythm is regular (not sharply regular but regular), if the rhythm becomes obviously irregular, this considered abnormal rhythm.   During respiration, there is a slight change in the rhythm of the heart (becomes slightly irregular) that is hardly noticeable by feeling the pulse. If a person takes a deep breath and holds it, heart rate becomes slower and the heart beats stronger but again it is till regular and it is not going to be felt unless the pulse is checked.  When you say faster and slower, what is your original heart rate? How fast does your heart rate become and when it slows, does it go back to its original rate or even slower than that?  One of the major vessels that come out of the heart and supply the brain run along the throat very close to the ears, so sometimes when a person is going to sleep and when it is quiet, the pulsation of this big vessel can be heard in the ear. If the whooshing is not regular and related to the pulse then this is ringing in the ears and not related to heart beats in any way.  If you are always checking your pulse to see whether it is regular or not, fast or not, slow or not, you are going to end up feelings things that might not be important and need not all the attention given to them. Palpitation means that you feel your heart beats inside the chest without checking the pulse.  In your case, mitral valve prolapse is a very well known cause for palpitations and atypical chest pain. If this was not already done, i would also suggest that you have some blood work done to make sure that nothing else is missed. A blood test for electrolytes and a thyroid function blood test is a good start.  Stop smoking, drinking alcholic beverages and too much caffeinated beverages, have more rest and enough sleep, try not to stress yourself and stop checking your pulse all the time for minor changes. If you feel that palpitations especially after heavy meals, i would suggest that you try to have smaller more frequent meals. These measures would help a lot with the feeling of palpitation. If after all these measures and with normal blood tests, you still have bothersome palpitations, i would recommend that you discuss the possibilty of taking a medication that would care of this problem.

    "content": "Hello -  About 3 years ago I had some bouts of diziness (as in faint, not room spinning) I never actually fell over, just had spells of feeling that I would.  I had check on ears and BP (which was a little high but put down to White Coat Syndrome after 24 hour monitor) and I was tentatively diagnosed with 'Menieres'   These symptoms thankfully decreased. Then abiut a year ago tey returned while on holiday, not as bad but noticable.   Then about 10 months ago I started to experience some chest pains for a couple of weeks and then I had one night of absolute agony. My chest was 'tight' (middle of chest) and my breathing felt a little heavy and laboured. There were however no pains on left arm/shoulder or back (Thankfully!).  I went to see the doctor the next day after a horrible night and he could find nothing wrong with an initial diagnosis - possible it was a stomach ulcer. However, I went to see another doctor who gave me an ECG (trace) which was okay but had one part of the tract that was a little high - he said it may be pressure on my heart.   I then went to see a cardiologist who said it may be an infection and he gave me an echo and said that he believed that I had a viral infection in my paracardium and it had put pressure on my heart and bruised it slightly.   This all took about 4 weeks.   While I am now much better, I still get some chest pains and a sudden 'stitch' pain either down the lower left of my 'left pec' or to its right. The menieres is occasional but currently in remision (and long may it be).   I was just wondering if there was any advise of if I should get checked out again or if there is any medication I could ask about (I have not taken any meds for this at all). The 'natural shop' suggested bee propigate I think, supposed to be a natural antibiotic but needs to see a docotr before taking if have chest problems.   Any advice appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear kellbrn,  A small portion of the patients who took or are taking zyrtec and optivar have complained about getting tachycardia, whether or not this is caused by either drug is yet to be determined.  The dyspnea is most probably related to the tachycardia. Each time you become tachycardic you become dyspneic.  This tachycardia has to be worked up just to make sure that nothing is missed, have a tsh (to rule out thyroid problems) and your electrolytes checked. Try to avoid caffeinated beverages, smoking and drinking alcohol. Have enough rest and sleep.  Depo-provera is known to cause blood clots, i think you should be ruled out for the presence of a dvt and/or a pulmonary embolus.  If all the above tests come back normal, i think an echocardiogram and a test to rule out asthma would be a reasonable next step.   i will leave the issue of stopping the allergy medications for you to discuss with your doctor. You can stop them for a while and see whether or not these symptoms improve and then re-introduce them once more and see whether or not you will ge the symptoms back.

    "content": "Dear Jim,  i am not sure what kind of monitor you use and whether or not it is of good quality, however, if you don't have any symptoms with this, there is nothing to worry about.  Your maximum predicted heart rate according to your age is 197 per minute.  If this happens during absolute rest and not after exercise, then at this point you will have to be seen by a doctor to evaluate you for a possible arrhythmia.  It is always a good thing to keep ahead of dehydration by having drinks (preferably rich in electrolytes to compensate for the electrolytes loss during sweating).  Have you had a physical before you started exercising that vigorously? It is usually recommended to have one before you start a vigorous exercise program.

    "content": "I am a 19 year old healthy male who eats well, avoiding fast foods and stuff of that nature.  For the past week or so I have been having heartburn like feelings in my left chest area on the inside of my body and a sore tender left pectoral to the touch.  However, I haven't really done anything to make this muscle sore and I am not sure if it's possible the two are related.  The heartburn feeling isn't just after I eat and I have continually tried Zantac as a means to reduce it with little to no success.  I've had no pain in my arms but a few times I have randomly felt short of breath.  I tried jogging and playing basketball a few times and neither seemed to worsen the condition or cause the shortness of breath.  Do I need to get checked out or am I stressing over nothing? Please help.\n\n",

The probability that this chest pain be due to coronary disease is very low.  The pain in the left pecteroal could be inflammation and not part of the burning sensation. You can try any over the counter pain reliever such as aleve, advil and the like.  Try something stronger than zantac like prilosec over the counter for a trial to relief the burning sensation.

    "content": "Hi.  I'm a 41 y/o male about 20lbs overweight and in relatively OK health.  Over the past few years I have been paranoid about heart problems.  I suffer from Acid Reflux but many of the symptoms were similar (in my mind) to having a heart attack.  I did a treadmill test about 2.5 years ago and about 1.5 years ago I remained so concerned that the Dr. did an angiogram.   The findings on both were negative and there were no blockages or any obvious problems.  I have controlled hypertension and a mild Hiatis Hernia.  I had annual blood tests last week and all was fine.  I still have considerable fulness of the chest that comes and goes, I have discomfort when I'm excercising and now I suffer from fatigue and light headedness that effects my day to day living.  I do belch considerably and often feel generally unwell.    I have reduced my excercise because I'm always concerned that it's heart related. I can't seem to get that out of my mind.  Its all a very vicious circle and I don't know where to turn.  Doctors think I am just 'crazy' now.  I don't drink or smoke and generally an extremely positive outgoing person but this is starting to change me considerably and \"behind the scenes\" I suffer quite a lot. I seem to be able to keep a bold positive face in public.  I am an executive in a multi national company and under considerable stress and travel extensively around the world (amost every 2nd week).  Sometimes I get home and wonder how I got through the day.  I don't know what to do now!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Constant chest discomfort",
    "content": "Dear Norby,  To determine whether or not chest pain is due to coronary disease, major risk factors of the person suffering from the chest pain are looked at and the characteristics of the pain are looked at and then the probability of this pain being due to coronary disease is then determined.  As for risk factors, you are a male and you have controlled hypertension. Your chest pain sounds atpyical as compared to that of coronary disease. So, your probability that you have coronary disease is low. On top, you had a negative stress and a coronary angiogram. So, you had the gold standard test to detect coronary disease and it was negative, so you definitely don't have coronary disease, so there is no need to worry whatsoever about having coronary disease.  Chest discomfort can be caused by hiatal hernia and acid reflux disease. Have you ever tried antiacid medications to see whether or not they can improve your chest discomfort.  My bias is, if a person continues to have chest pain that proves not to be due to coronary disease, i always exclude neck spine problems, so i recommend that you have a neck x-ray/ct scan to make sure that you don't have neck spine problems.   Travelling around the world every 2 weeks is no doubt a very exhausting task and no wonder you feel tired.   If the x-ray/ct scan of the neck tunrs out to be normal and the trial of the antiacids was not succecssful, these could be panic attacks and i would suggest that you try a small dose of a tranquilizer to see whether it helps.

    "content": "Dear Norby,  What you are describing sounds more of gastric origin rather than of cardiac origin.  When was the last time you had your hiatal hernia evaluated? It might be getting worse. The ultimate treatment of a hiatal hernia is surgical but unfortunately it is not an easy surgery and many times, surgery does not relief the chest pain and sometimes, surgery is not successful.  This chest pain could also be due to esophageal spasms. Have you tried any anti-spasmodics?  i recommend that you have your hiatal hernia re-evaluated by a gastroenterologist to see whether or not it is getting worse and the best way to deal with it.  Also, i suggest that you discuss the possibility of trying a very small dose tranquilizer with you doctor to help calm you down during the attacks which might help a lot in controlling your symptoms as well.

In this big artery in the neck, it has a plexus of nerves that when you massage it, you can have low pulse and low blood pressure. Please, try to avoid deep massages of the neck in the future.

    "content": "Dear Billy,  Thank you very much for the update.  Lower limb edema can be caused by either  1. Local causes in the leg themselves such as standing on one's feet for prolonged periods of time or having conditions such as varicose veins. 2. General causes such as heart failure, lung problems (you are a smoker and i think you should be checked for copd), kidney problems (already ruled out) and liver problems (i think it is not a bad idea to check a liver functions blood test).  If everything turns out to be normal. There is a solution to the edema is to wear compression stockings once you wake up and even before you set foot on the ground and there is no need for the medication.  Hiatal hernia and gerd are 2 different conditions, you can have either disease separtely or you can have both of them simultaneously. Hiatal hernia means that part of your stomach is in the chest and gerd means that the some of the acid in your stomach finds its way up to the esophagus (which is an abnormal direction for the acid to go to).  Go to your doctor and tell him/her about the prilosec helping.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "Dear Billy,  Heart burn due to acid reflux disease can cause chest pain. It is a fact.   The mechanism is: 1. Direct irritation of lining of the esophagus by the stomach acid. The lining of the esophagus is not prepared to be exposed to acid, so it gets irritated and sometimes destroyed giving rise to pain. 2. Sometimes the esophagus goes into spasms from the irritation and this gives rise to chest pain as well.  Prilosec is a stronger acid inhibitor than pepcid. So, the amount of acid secreted by the stomach decreases tremendously and the esophagus is not exposed to acid any more and the irritation goes away and hence the pain also goes away.  Regarding the edema your lower limbs, i have to have more information to as to try and figure out a cause.

Well i still once and a while get these chest pain near the left side of my chest, i have noticed that by ignoring the and trying to just relax with my anxiety they have slowly been happening less and less over time. What i have notcied that started developign now is that i feel like this dizzyness come over me once in a while at school or at home. What i mean by dizzyness is like i might feel inbalanced or that like i just finished spinning in a  circle when i might put my head down at scool and close my eyes. I ge tthe sudden rush of me like spinning or something i cant really explin it but it just leaves me feeling dizzy and like unbalanced sometimes. The only things i have notcied aside of that  is like a sort of pain in my rigt ear ONCE in a while like not very often. Maybe a lil in my right but more in the left. A few days ago after a shower i decided to try to clean my ears and noticed that this like redish kidna dark maybe even a lil blackish ear wax came out of my right ear. Anyways i just really don't kno if this might be caused by my anxiety or by an acid reflux or anything i would just really like some help.

    "content": "For the past few months I've been waking up with my arms numb and, on occasion, my legs too.  Thinking I slept in a strange position I just ignored the symptoms.  Today my left arm went numb at work.  It stayed numb for about four hours and then, after I started getting pain in the jaw and pain in the chest (not severe, but pain), I went to the nearest emergency room.  It isn't a hospital but just an emergency facility.  I received an EKG, some blood work and they said my EKG was okay,  I could possibly have arthritis   or perhaps my electrolytes were low.  I was told to take 300mg of aspirin and to see my family doctor.  I never second guess a doctor so, after having been there an hour, I went home. My wife then talked to my mother and told her what happened and she flipped and wanted to take me to the regional medical center which is supposed to be an excellent heart facility. She has no problem second guessing anyone if she thinks they're wrong. She thinks they're wrong. Her reasoning?  All of the following: I am almost 41. My father died at  41 of a heart attack.  I am about 30 pounds overweight with all the extra weight being in the stomach area, I smoke a pack a day, I drink every day (beer), don't eat right, work sometimes 16 hours a day, eat only red meat and am in need of a total health makeover. She thinks I should be seeing a cardiologist and not the family doctor.   If my EKG was okay and they allowed me to leave then I am thinking that it isn't my heart. She doesn't agree and said that an EKG is not a definitive tool and that I could still be having cardiac problems.  Yes, I realize that I need to change my outlook on the status of my health and make some drastic changes asap. But, could it still be the heart even if the EKG was okay?  Thanks for any info you can give.  It's appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the reply.  I was just released from the hospital yesterday.  After the first  visit I went home to bed and the next day at about 10AM, it all started again.  This time I went to the hospital, the real one, and I was admitted for obeservation and then, in the am, was given a stress test with the dye.  I don't have the results of the test but they said it was okay and discharged me.  I am supposed to go to my family doctor, have him look at the stress test results, have him order follow up testing and see what's up. The numbness in my legs has been going on for a few months but that pain in the jaw and the armpit pain etc was something new and kind of got my attention.  Since I had the stress test I told my \"typical Italian Mother\" that I'm fine and she can relax.  No way will that happen as she is now thinking that perhaps the stress test wasn't definitve enough and I need more testing.  Somebody PLEASE write in and tell me that negative stress test means no heart problem.  I can then print it out, show it to her at Easter when I see her, and get on with my life! I'll be forever in your debt!  LOL  PS The ER doctor thought perhaps I had a pinched nerve or some degenrative disc disease. I think he only admitted me because he was afraid of my mother!\n\n",

At the onset of my problems, a little over a year ago, I started having \"anxiety attacks\"...and these are the EXACT same symptoms I had, but I also usually have to take a bowel movement...or two, when they occur with me.  I was told that they were anxiety attacks, but I'm not so sure this is the case.  For at least 10 years, leading up to this, I had \"spells\" where I would get weak, disoriented, and my feet would sweat.  I usually had to sit down and wait till the spell passed.  I did not have my first true \"anxiety attack\" until a little over a year ago when I started having these other problems (high blood pressure, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, etc).  My doc's at VA treated the anxiety attacks with Clonazepam...which has seemed to work about 45 minutes after taking it.  I too have trouble sleeping, and I have had this problem since the Gulf War (1991).  Recently, however, I keep getting awoken by my arms being asleep (tingly, unable to move them well)...EVEN if I'm laying flat on my back or stomach.  I would not think there should anything restricting circulation (with the way I am laying).  Could you possibly give me some more info on this Carcinoid Syndrome?  I saw that you had asked one poster if they had diarreaha (sp?) with these symptoms.  I usually do.  Thank you for your input Doctor!  I sincerely appreciate it!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Carcinoid syndrome?",
    "content": "Dear Eric,  Carcinoid syndrome is a rare syndrome caused by substances secreted in the blood by carcinoid tumours which mainly arise in the gastrointestinal tract (gut) and the lungs.  Clinical manifestations include: 1. Flushing: Occurs in 85% of patients. The typical flush involves the face, neck and upper chest, which become red to violaceous or purple, severe flushes are accompanied by a fall in blood pressure and rise in pulse rate. Most flushing episodes occur spontaneously, but they can be provoked by eating, drinking alcohol, having a bowel movement or emotional events. 2. Diarrhea: Occurs in 80% of patients and is often the most debilitating component of the syndrome. Stools may vary from few to more than 30 per day, are typically watery and nonbloody, and can be explosive and accompanied by abdominal cramping.  3. Bronchospasm: 10-20% of patients have wheezing and dyspnea, often during flushing episodes. 4. Heart valvular lesions: The valves of the right side of the heart are most often affected 5. Venous telangiectasia: Purplish vascular lesions that appear late in course of the disease and are due to prolonged vasodilatation, and most often occur on the nose, upper lip and cheeks area.  The growth of such tumours is slow. Prognosis depends on the size of the tumour and the presence or absence of metastases.

    "content": "Hello, I am currently experienceing chest tightness and thought it was nothing until my manager just informed me that I shouldn't dismiss it. I came out of an abusive relationship aout 4 years ago and developed anxiety...I thought. I went to the doctor a few weeks ago for a trange feeling that I have been having for over a few years now. I at times feellike I'm moving but I'm not. It's not dizziness, I have no idea how to explain it...it really kicks into over drive when I'm on the 2nd floor of SOME buildings...I have no idea why.I start to feel unbalanced and just plain strange. When I was diagnosed with anxiety I read up on it and learned about a feeling of un relity...I have been having this since I was a little girl...I'm now 25...I never knew ow to explain it until I read that. The Doctor that I saw a few weeks ago said that it might not be anxiety but rather depression caused my my abusive relaitonship. Which he says can cause these feeling s of feeling strange or cause the feeling of moving at times. I don't see the connection but want to get a 4th opinion. Everyone has something different to tell me. I am supposed to go in for Lab work (which I did 4 years ago when this started and nothing was wrong) but have not been able to as of yet. If nothing came from the LAB results then he wa going to have me see a behavioral Theripsit to get their opionion on whether everything I'm experiencing could be due to depression and the anxietyis just of part of it. I just don't know anymore when I have a pain if it's from that or something else I need to be worried about. And yes I'm under a lot of stress due to finances...I've been asked a million times over. any thoughts of anything that I mentioned will be greatly appreciated Sorry for the many mis spellings but I am at work and in a hurry...\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tiredl,  To determine whether or not chest pain is caused by coronary disease, risk factors for coronary disease and chest pain characteristics are looked at and then the probability of this pain being due to coronary disease is determined.  You don't have any major risk factors for coronary disease. You did not mention anything about your chest pain characteristics for me to able to judge whether or not they are typical.  However, females of the child bearing age are naturally protected against coronary disease unless they have had major risk factors (smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol) for many years which you don't, so, most probably the chest tightness that you have is not related to coronary disease.  What you are describing sounds to me more like anxiety rather than depression.   i think a behavioral therapist or even being referred to a psychiatrist would be a good idea.

    "title": "Heart flutters up to 20 a day",
    "content": "Hello. I'm new to this forum and am very concerned about recent heart symptoms that I have been suffering from.  My problems first started when I was 15. My mother was diagnosed with cancer in 2000 and I suffered greatly from anxiety and became very stressed and emotional. As a result, when I was 16 (almost 17) I began to develop heart palpitations that came and went whenever I peaked at a very high level of stress. This caused heart palpitations (8 or 9 in total) each lasting between 1 and 1 and half minutes each. It caused me to sweat and go very pale, which is saying a lot, as I myself am very pale anyway.  I would also often lose myself in computer games to ignore what was going around me; this however only made the effect worse. I saw a doctor in 2001 shortly after these and he reasoned that this was due to my stress and was nothing to worry about. He thought they were harmless and would subside. As a result of calming myself down, they eventually stopped but as my mother became progressively ill I started to notice heart flutters or \"skipped beats\" which subsequently replaced the heart palpitations.  This got me extremely worried and I felt that I might have caused damage to my heart from the levels of stress, which I suffered constantly. When my mother died in 2002, I found it very difficult and as if my life had no meaning. I went back into education but found social interaction only increased my heart flutters still.  I now, at the age of between 17 until my current age (which is 19) still get them, possibly between 15 and 20 times a day. They can be from the very mild to the very noticeable and are most definitely related to stress. I find calming myself down can make me have 1 to no heart flutters in a day, but the stress of my life that I have to undertake day to day only encourages them.  I have done a lot of reading up on hypertension and the studies related to them and am now worried that I may have HBP (High Blood Pressure) which has damaged my arteries and is the cause of my flutters. I fill most of the symptoms: tiredness, sweating, clamminess, heart flutters, chest pains (of which I have noticed very recently and come and go on the left side of my chest, usually when I am sleeping - and also that my right arm often becomes swelled as if someone has cut off the circulation if i hold it in certain positions).  I last had my blood pressure checked a year ago and it was normal. However, I believe that I must have caused some effect on my heart. What I cannot understand however, is why the heart flutters happen more when I lie in certain positions or breath deeply whilst resting?  If you have read this far, I thank you very much for you time and would appreciate any feedback at all to this. I understand that this may be complex to give support to but anything at all to help or ease my mind would be greatly beneficial.  I am very young and worried. With no parents to turn to I feel very alone in a situation of this magnitude.  Thank you again, Richard.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Heart symptoms",
    "content": "Dear Richard,  First of all, high blood pressure takes a much longer time than just a year to affect the arteries, so there is no worries what so ever.  What do you mean by the word palpitations? Would you please elaborate more. Do you just feel your heart beating at a normal rate and rhythm but just feel it or do you mean that you feel faster and regular or fast and regular or fast and irregular?  i see that you use the word flutters for skipped beats, tell me exactly what you feel when you have those skipped beats.  Palpitations have several causes including: 1. Mitral valve prolapse (a condition associated with palpitations, atypical chest pain in the other healthy young adult). 2. Hyperactive thyroid gland. 3. Electolyte disturbances. 4. Smoking. 5. Drinking alcohol. 6. Drinking too much caffeinated beverages. 7. Being tired and not getting enough sleep. 8. Stress.  If you have not had a thyroid function test or a blood test for electrolytes, i would strongly urge you to do so, even though the yield most probably is going to be low but just because they are so common and i think they have to be ruled out.  If you smoke, drink alcohol or too much caffeinated beverages (tea, coffee, pop, etc...), and you don't get enough sleep, i would encourage you to refrain from smoking, drinking alcohol and caffeinated beverages and have enough sleep. These measures, even though they sound simple yet, they help a lot of patients getting rid of their symptoms.  At one point in time, \"skipped beats\" of certain type used to be treated, but there was a study conducted on healthy young adults, in which they wore heart monitors for 24 hours, and it was found that skipped beats are common in this healthy population, so it was decided not treat them anymore.  You have had these symptoms for quite some time. And you have a choice of whether or not you want this pursued further.   i think from your description, that most probably, there is nothing really serious.  This being said, however, i would like you to see your doctor to have the above mentioned tests done, and if your doctor thinks it is indicated may be have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) done to rule out mitral valve prolapse.  If all these tests come back normal and you did all the recommendations about stopping smoking, etc..., and you still have these palpitations, you can either choose to get treatment for the palpitations, or if your doctor thinks that these are secondary to stress, you can take a medication that helps with stress, and see whether it helps.

    "title": "[no title]",
    "content": "The palpitations I had came before the irregular heart beats I felt. However, in saying that, the palpitations always began with what felt to be the skipped beats that I feel now. If I was to describe the process of the palpitations from start to finish that I had exactly, i would say it was as followed:  Normal heart rate followed by LARGE amounts of stress - which always seemed to be the main cause - increasing my heart rate. Constant increased heart rate (usually built up over a few hours), followed by a sudden flutter or \"skipped beat\". Irratic heart beats immediately after the flutter, causing my heart rate to reach probably between 150 - 170 beats per minute? Very rapid. This lasted a very short time, possibly 1 to 1 and a half minutes, usually prolonged by the stress of fear and stopped as quick as it began. Normally my heart could even return to a slowed rate, if not resting pace.  These palpitations have now stopped as I reduced the large amounts of stress in my life, however these left me with the \"skipped beats\" i mentioned previously. The \"skipped beats\" can be felt as mild, (sometimes hardly at all) to the noticable which usually effects me worringly as I feel it just as I could feel someone gripping my hand.  Its feels like a sudden contraction of the heart which grips for a moment and then suddenly releases again with one hard heart beat.. as if my heart had lungs and took a deep breath for a moment, and then a sudden hard breath out (returning to normal pace) is the only way I can sort of describe it. One of the most familar things I managed to link it with was from a website which showed a video of the heart prematurely firing, allowing the ventricle more time to fill with blood, having to push out harder than usual to push or \"force\" the blood out. At least I think thats correct.  Another example would be to take your hand and simulate the beating of your heart with your fingers. Just move them at a normal pace as if the heart was resting then suddently contract your fingers inward for a brief moment (maybe half a second to a second or so), and then release quickly with a push and return to a normal pace <<<< THAT is what I feel. I couldnt give you a closer example.  These often happen around stress and I sometimes can have up to or more than 3 in a row if I am especially anxious about a situation or stressor.  About the palpitations and causes. Firstly, I do not smoke and never have or will. I drink water at home and only ever drink stimulants such as coffee or coke when I am out (which is very rarely). I limit my amounts of alcohol sensibly and I usually eat as healthy as I can. Better than most students of my age, that can be said! I am at the exact right body weight for my height which is 5'9 and I have never been overweight or abused my body through drugs or anything of the sorts. The only symtoms I can relate with are stress and lack of sleep. I always look tired and often suffer from fatigue. That said, sometimes I take more sleep than necessary and feel/look more tired than usual. However I do keep myself idle sometimes, which can sometimes be from fear of pushing my body, e.g. resulting in the \"skipped heart beats\" being felt or just that I do not take part in enough activities. This can cause me to continually focus on the stress, however, as it plays on my mind whilst I am do nothing in particular.  This is still of great concern to me. I believe the arm feeling i felt is due to my heavy bag I cart around at college but am still unsure. I feel, even though I have not yet been consulted by a doctor that through what I have been saying, this is seems to be greatly connected with stress. But can stress and lack of sleep really cause these onsets?  Thank you ever so much for your feedback so far and in helping me to find out what is causing these!  Thank you again, RichardC\n\n",

    "title": "Chest Pain",
    "content": "Hi, I am a 38 year old woman i have three kids and I am a single mother.  We went up to NJ for Christmas, upon coming back my oldest daughter had a cold. Spending 2 days in a car with her sick I ended up feeling sick. by Jan 3rd I had no voice which did not alarm me because every time i get a cold i loose my voice for a few days.. Well my friend was concerned so on Jan 122th I went to the dr and she informed me that I had an ear infection, a upper respitory infection and laryangitis. She gave me Z-pac 5 day dose. I finished that medication and by the evening of the 19th I was changing the sheets on my bed and noticed I was out of breath like I had just ran a marathon. The next morning I contact my dr. and went in to see her.  Mind you still no voice. she thought there may have been a problem with my vocal cords so she sent me to an ENT. I went to see him and he scoped me and said that my vocal cords were fine and that I was not getting enough air from my lungs to produce sound.  Well the next morning 2oth went back to my doctor to let her know what was going on. Mind you out of breath from simply even walking around.   She gave me a breathing treatment which did not help i was devloping a fever and freezing she noticed my skin white clamy (not sure of the correct term) anyway she sent me downstairs in a wheelchair to the ER.  After being in the ER for about 6 hrs and them doing all the life threating test (chest x-ray, blood gases, nuclar medicene, soft tissue ct of my throat etc) they were unable to find anything wrong. They referred me to a Pulmonary dr. and gave me a precription for an inhaler. durring this time i developed chest discomfort like someone sitting on my chest and also fell it in my back like being squezed together.   I went to see the pulmonary dr he sceduled me for a pulmonary embli test (not sure if this is the correct name) they put in the dye to check for blood clots in the arteries to the lungs. and a breathing test -which I was unable to complete.   His assessment was there was no problem with my lungs and said he is unable to help me.   I now am waiting for my doctor to see what the next step is.   This has been a month of being sick and I have no idea why this sudden onset of these symtoms of chest pain,discomfort, back pain, dizzness and getting out of breath doing simple things, lack of energy etc.   I am normally an active person not overweight (104lbs) don't smoke, hardly ever drink,  try to eat healthy, I do expierence low blood sugar since i was a child. . I don't know much about my medical history other than my mother had a heart condition and died from heart related problem.  My grandmother had some sort of artery health issue cannot remember exactly I was a child when she passed.       Any help or advice you could give would be great. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Cheermom1993,  i hope that you are feeling better now.  i think the next step would be to have an echocardiogram to make sure that the cause of your shortness of breath is not from the heart.  Some viruses affect the heart and cause weakness of the heart muscle even though it is too early for the symptoms of heart failure to appear.  Even though the breathing treatment did not improve your symptoms (i am not sure whether you were given the breathing treatment empirically or because you had wheezing), i would recommend that you have a test to exclude asthma as a cause for your symptoms.  i hope that this was just a viral infection that lingered for a while more than it should have.

    "content": "Hi, My name is Doug and about a year ago I had an LAD dissection. This happened to me when I was working out with the High school wrestling team. I am 43 and had done that before. I  had an angioplasty and a stent  put in. At the hospital, I was told that I had no evidence of heart disease, the heart looked good, I had no history of high blood pressure and my cholesterol was measured at 210.  The doctors said my anatomy was good and I should recover fully. I have had numerous tests and bloodwork done this year. I have followed my routines and drug therapy, increased my exercise program, had a cardiolyte stress test done, lost weight ect... On all follow up visits, everything looks peachy and on  all the tests they have run. I, however, still feel strange at times with various symptoms that occur and I even had my first ever panic attack about 3 months after the heart atttack(dissection).  I  feel sometimes that i may  not get over the doubts that this incident has put in my head and I don't like these little fears that seem to be hanging despite all the good news I am receiving from my doctors. I hope that you don't mind, but I had to get this off of my chest      Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doug,  From what you mentioned, it sounds that you are making progress towards recuperation.  If you are increasing your exercise program without problems, this is a very good indicator that you are not getting worse but better.  It is a very good thing that you are losing weight and good about taking medications, etc... So, this means that you are doing everything right and you are not supposed to get worse if you are doing everything that you should be doing.  Having a negative cardiolyte stress test is also a good indicator that there is no residual ischemia and this should make you feel more confident that you are not getting worse but getting better.  Whenever you feel that you need to talk about anything, not just about your illness, you are more than welcome to post it here on the boards.

    "content": "For the last week or so beginning in my shoulder blade area on my left side I began experiencing alot of pain, and thought I had just pulled a muscle or something. Then  I thought maybe it was just trapped gas or something so I took some Nexxum but that didn't help much either.   The after a few days the pain moved to the center of my back up around the cervical area around the L2 area.  I used a Lidoderm pain patch and go no relieve, I used a heating pad for a few days which made it feel better while using it but it didn't stop the pain.  Then 2 days ago I began to hurt from my back to the front in my chest, and it hurts to breathe sometimes.  Like if I take a breathe, it feels like someone is sitting on my chest.  The pain has gotten alot worse.  My Family Physician/Pain doctor has ordered an MRI of my back/cervical area.  This is really scarey to me .  Do you have any idea what it might be?  I can't get my MRI until next week\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Heather,  i think you should have a blood test for thyroid functions and electrolytes. An ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) is recommended to make sure that these palpitations are not due to mitral valve prolapse.  You already stopped smokinng and drinking caffeinated beverages but are you getting enough rest and sleep?   If the above mentioned tests come back negative, and you still have these palpitations, you can either choose to get treatment for those palpitations if they are really bothering you, or if your doctor thinks that these are secondary to stress, you can take a tranquilzer to help relief this stress and see whether the palpitations will go away.

    "content": "I have written a post once already about chest pains. Pains since I was 18 that only lasted for a few seconds to a couple days. Now I am now 32 , and on my 8th week of this. I am having a constant dull pressured pain, and sharp shooting electric pains (as quick as a bolt of lightening) throughout the day and night. (waking me out of my sleep) I have been put on Soma, cataflam, protonix, and xanax. It is from my family doctor, who believes I ave costo chondritis. I was diagnosed with MVP 2 years ago. I am now  having cramping.in all my abdominal area, with the chest pain worsening. I had a stomach ultrasound done on Monday which showed a normal gallbladder,liver, and kidneys. Then a couple days later I had blood come up my throat and into my mouth, while taking a shower. 2 days later I went to do my echo, and stress test, in which, my ekg was abnormal, but the echo showed nothing , but MVP. ( But the tech swears she saw something, but the doctor called it shadows.  I am hurting everyday, trying to function  as regular is impossible, and has been for 8 weeks. progressively getting worse. Everything runs through my mind, I have saline breast implants, I wonder if scar tissue has built up behind them, I wonder if its intestinal, I wonder if its heart related. Its in no way or shape an anxiety issue with me, causing any of the physical part of this. Of course after so long, and being in pain, and seeing blood, and not being able to put a finger on an answer, I get very scared at times. Especially when I awake of of a deep sleep with this shooting horrible pain. I am trying not to take the drugs often, because they really do not alter the pains, and they are also addictive. I mostly take the protonix, but everynow and then I have to take the others. Some days I go to sleep (with xanax )hurting so bad that I wonder if I will wake up the next morning. Its starting not to scare me if I don't. Because I am suffering. I have also had blood in my stool over a course of a year.  I have an appiontment for an colonoscopy, and endoscopy, but not until April. What am I supped to do with that? That is too far away. What could be causing such constant unrelenting pain in my chest? Why is it ok , for my ekg to be abnormal?  I have such a swollen fist sensation of my left side of my chest, and sharp shootong electric pain acros thewhole thing, with palpitations, when I am at rest, and not even paying any attention.  I can be in the happiest place, and relaxed and enjoying my time, and it will shoot this pain everytime, no matter what i am doing. I am at a loss of what to do or think. I am at a loss with my doctors, both my cardiologist, and intestinal doctors are on vacation right now. My drugs are not helping, and I am just at a mental and physical loss. Please tell me what to do? I need an honest,  professional, and attentive opinion. PLEASE?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jenny,  To determine whether or not chest pain is caused by coronary disease, the major risk factors for coronary disease in the patient complaining of chest pain are assessed and the characteristics of the chest pain are looked at and the probability of this pain being caused by coronary disease is then determined.   Females of the child bearing age are naturally protected against coronary disease unless they have had major risk factors for long periods of time. You are a smoker, and this is only one major risk factor for coronary disease. Your chest pain sounds very atypical as compared to that of coronary disease. So, to begin with, your probability of this being due to coronary disease is low.   You had a stress echo, i am not sure whether it was an exercise stress (if it was an exercise stress test and you kept exercising till your heart rate reached its goal without you having typical chest pain, this is a very good sign that you don't have coronary disease) or a chemical stress. At any rate, it was negative by echo. ekgs are not the best tool to diagnose coronary disease, otherwise, other tools would have not been invented or used. ekgs specially in the females is even worse than males to diagnose coronary disease. Echoes are far better than ekgs because echo visualizes the heart in real time and any abnormality is immediately identified. What do you mean by an abnormal ekg? Coronary disease has a specific pattern on the ekg during the stress test and if it was not there even if the ekg looked abnormal (whatever that means), then the probability of this abnormality being secondary to coronary disease is low.  So, your clincal probability that this pain is due to coronary disease is low to begin with and your stress echo was negative, so i am confident that this pain is not due to coronary disease.   So, when you have your pain, don't think of the worst which is coronary disease, because you don't have it. If you are still very worried about this pain be due to coronary disease, then you might want to discuss having a coronary angiography with your cardiologist, this is the gold standard test to diagnose coronary disease. It is an invasive test and has its complications of course, but since your stress echo was negative, i am not sure that any cardiologist will be agreeable to that.  Your chest pain could be very well related to your mitral valve prolpase as mitral valve prolapse is notorious for having atypical chest pain. Did you try any medications for the pain? Beta blockers can be used in a trial to control the pain.  The character of the pain suggests that this pain could be due to back or spine problems. i would recommend that you have a neck x-ray or ct scan to exclude spine problems.  Blood coming out of your mouth is an alarming symptom, but the most common cause of having blood coming out of your mouth, is related to inflammation or infection, so you could have been having a bad bronchitis (specially that you are a smoker) or a bad case of sinusitis or sore throat even. i think you should mention this symptom to your doctor once available and if you have this symptom again, i would recommend you having a ct scan of the chest to make sure that there is no cause in the lungs that would cause this.  Is there a relation between blood and chest pain and the answer is yes but not in the clinical setting that you are describing. A condition called pulmonary embolism can cause  but this is not what you have as your symptoms do not fit the symptoms and signs of pulmonary embolism.

    "content": "First let me start out by thanking you very much for taking the time to speak with me, and looking at my post. Thankyou!!  Yes I had an excercise stress test. An echo first, then the treadmill, and then an echo again as soon as I stepped of the treadmill. But I did not complete the test. I had a bad shooting pain at 148 heart rate, which is when my ekg pattern showed something ( at that exact moment) They had wanted to see my rate get to 160, but we did not make it, as they said stop, and i got down, and did the echo. Which was blocked on the right side by my breat implant, which made it difficult to get a side view. The technician and the doctor disagreed over the results (right in front of me) He ended up looking at it for 10 minutes, and calling it shadows. But I did not get a discussion with that doctor, he is not my cardiologist, mine was on vacation. so they said they would get the results to him, and I have an appointment, when he comes back . Mitral valve prolapse can cause pain across your chest? See, I never knew that, no one ever really explained anything about MVP to me before. Just basically what it is, and thats it. When I bleed in my mouth, I really had no signs of infection in the nose or throat, or any bronchitis symptoms. It just sort of leaked up like reflux does, except it did not burn. I wasn't coughing or gagging or anything. Which was quite scary. I would love to get my lungs looked at . My father died 4 years ago, at age 64, of COPD ,and asbestos .His systems eventually shut down.  I disguss this chest pain with my doctor, he automatically diagnosed me with cost chrondritis, with out any testing, just by our discussion. He said he has had it for years himself. So, he gave me all those pills I mentioned, that really do not help the pain, but do help some of the anxiety I get when I\"M hurting.  I do not want to find something terribly wrong with myself, but I want to stop this pain. Its been day after day, and all night long. Never in all my years, has it lasted this long,Or been this painful, and consistent,  the maximum has been 2 days..a long time ago. At age 22. Now I am counting the months. I have stopped my job, and been house bound, majority of the days. It was always just a minute or 2 of instant pain , and then it would disappear , as quick as it came. But not this time.  Its taking me to new levels, with side systems of blood, and severe joint pain, shortness of breath, and constant chest pain. Not knowing which avenues to explore, and everyhting is such a slow process to be seen. I just want to say thankyou for your time once again.... Thankyou...Jenny\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jenny,  Thank you very much for the update.  First of all, please, stop smoking.  i am still convinced that your chest pain is not due to coronary disease, the pain that you had during your stress is not typical and i am still not sure about the ekg abnormality but if it was typical of coronary disease, the doctor would have said that, regarding the echo, i think it is going to be really difficult to interpret the results with your breast implants.  Breast implants have lots of complications including leakage of the fluid within the implant, and this leak will cause symptoms in some patients specially if the patient is allergic to this substance. i would recommend that you call your surgeon and ask to be seen for this chest pain, there is no doubt that he/she will add a valuable opinion about whether or not this chest pain and all your other symptoms might be due to the breast implant and what are the possible solutions if they are due the implant.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again, I went to the plastic surgeon who said its not my implants, But I am not sure, as he did no test or anythng what so ever. I saw my family doctor who is now taking me a little more seriously because of the blood issue. He sent me to get a chest CT scan, yesterday. (with the iodine injection) So I will hear about the rseults this Thursday, when I go back to see him. But I have a big question for you!  My doctor (the family one) Has given me beta-blockers to take in the mean time.  They are called Coreg-Carvedilol. I read that they reduce blood pressure, and mine is always around 98 over 60. I am always pretty low. Do you think , I should be taking this, and why do you think that he thinks I should? Taking new things makes me nervous, because I am already on soma, and xanax. No one has put a finger on the heart , and chest pain I feel. So I was wondering in your opinion can these beta blockers effect me in a negative way? In conjunction with the other pills I am taking? My biggest question is....Do you believe its a good idea, and what exactly do thet do? Thankyou , Jenny.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jenny,  Thank you very much for the update.  Hopefully, the ct scan of the chest will show if there is any leak or inflammation surrounding the breast implants.  The coreg is most probably given for the chest pain. Since you have mitral valve prolpase, this chest pain could be caused by mitral valve prolapse, and the beta blockers group of medications (to which coreg belongs) are used to control chest pain originating from mitral valve prolapse.  Coreg can be given in a very small dose so it will not affect your blood pressure at all or will cause a very small change.  There is no interaction between coreg and soma or xanax.

The pain that you are describing on behalf of your son sounds more like an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the lungs or the heart.  There is a heart condition called mitral valve prolapse, notorious for causing atypical chest pain in young otherwise healthy people, it is diagnosed by having an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) and just needs to be followed.  Acid reflux disease can give rise to your son's symptoms as well.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "I am a 56 yo male. In 2000, I had a double bypass, with a quick recovery. I am on medication for high cholesteral, high blood pressure and acid reflex. Starting about a year after my CABG, I occasionally get what I call \"attacks\" or \"episodes\" of very servere pain in my upper left chest, sometimes radiating to my shoulder and back. On the 1 to 10 pain scale, I rate them as a 9. During the attack, the very bad pain can last for upto an hour, and then it subsides over the next few hours. With each attack, I go to the ER, where EKG's and blood work come up negative. Because of these attacks, my cardiolist has also performed several heart catherizations and stress tests with echo-cardigram. In each case, they came up negative. However, within the past year, they did notice that 3 of my heart chambers have enlarged (they weren't enlarged before), but tests for leakage were negative. My last attack was just a few days ago. Several of the attacks occured 1 to 2 hours after I woke up, but others have occured later in the day. I'm following up with my doctor, but I was wondering if you might have some thoughts as to what non-heart realted condition might be causing this? Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Robert,  It is very worrisome when a person with known coronary disease suffers from chest pain espcially post cabg as this could mean that the grafts are occluded. Your cardiologist did the right thing by performing a coronary angiogram to make sure that everything is ok.  At this point, i think we can confidently say that the pain that you are having is most probably non-cardiac.  This pain could be due neck spine problems, so i would recommend that you get a neck x-ray/ct scan to exclude neck spine problems.  Acid reflux can be getting worse, so i would recommend that you increase the dose of the medication that you are getting for acid reflux.  Sometimes, gall bladder problems can cause chest pain very similar to a heart attack, so i recommend that you have an ultrasound of the abdomen to exclude gall bladder problems.  This could be musculoskeletal pain, so try an antiinflamatory medication such as advil.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

Thyroid enlargement is usually painless unless there is an inflammation in the thyroid gland itself.   Vasovagal syncope should not give rise to pain in the chin area.

    "content": "I have done much research on what a normal heart rate is. I can find what it's supposed to be when you're exercising. I can find what it's supposed to be at rest.  But, what about during those in-between times?  Like when I run up a flight of stairs and fold laundry?  Or, when I'm doing the dishes?    I'm currently on Cardizem CD (for my PSVT - no attacks since hospital... I've been off the Lopressor for months).... I notice that when I wake up in the morning (the longest time since the cardizem has been last taken) that my heart may be at 115-120 when I'm brushing my teeth and getting dressed.  On some mornings it's lower and on others, it may be a little higher.  I never actually notice the heart beating, I only consciously take it out of curiosity (since I'm paranoid ever since my hospital visit).  I mentioned it to my cardiologist and he wasn't concerned.  But, I never got an answer to what is normal for light to moderate activity (even like taking a shower).  Is there an average?  Does 120bpm sound high for those activities (when resting is usually in the 70s and 80s).  When I'm on the treadmill, the heart acts normal and only seems to go to 120 half the time...   It always goes back to normal after resting for a minute or two.   Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Non rest - non exercising heart rate",
    "content": "Dear Lucidity03,  It differs from person to person.  In cases of professional athletes, the resting heart rate is usually on the slower side of normal and there were reports that some of them have even slower than normal pulse.  When there is a transition from rest to strenuous exercise, the heart rate goes very high very fast, but when you start a mild exercise, it goes high but at a slower rate and as far as i know, there is no mention of how much the heart rate is expected to go up when a person starts mild to moderate exercise for a short period of time.  120 is an accepted heart rate when you start at 70-80. Put in mind that you are on cardizem and this will make your heart rate even slower which is some patients don't tolerate if they need higher heart rates while they are exercising.  Heart rate going down quickly after exercise is a sign of being physically fit.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

They are extremely painful and cause me to catch my breath.  I also get occassional chest tightness/pressure that feels like a brick sitting on my chest.  Sometimes, I get this pressure after an \"attack\" of these bubbles, but not always.    I was diagnosed with hypothyroid in 2001.  My thyroid is currently off because I'm 13 weeks pregnant (TSH was 8.9 when I had my bloodwork done last week).  I also have a history of anemia and was given 4 treatments of Venofer this past summer.  My ferretin and hematocrit were also normal in my recent bloodwork.   I've asked a previous PCP about them and they shrugged them off, didn't know, weren't concerned.  I've also searched all over the net to find something, anything, and I've come up dry.  I found this site on a google search, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I hope someone can help!  ~ Heather\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Heather,  Females of the child bearing age are naturally protected against coronary disease unless they have had major risk factors for coronary disease for a long period of time. You don't have any major risk factor for coronary disease and the characteristics of the pain that you are describing are atypical as compared to those of chest pain related to coronary disease. So, the probability of this pain being due to coronary disease is very low.  Sometimes, when a person takes a fast breath or a deep breath, the lung might get overdistended fast and this pain comes on. i don't think that there is anything popping in your lung, otherwise you would have been very ill.   This pain could also be due to gastric problems such as acid reflux disease. Have you ever tried anti-acid medications?  Even though it does not sound like it, but there is a heart condition called mitral valve prolapse that can cause atypical chest pain. This condition is very common and does not pose any danger but has to be followed. It is diagnosed by having an ultrasound of the  heart (echocardiogram).  Neck problems are also know to cause chest pain, i recommend that you have a neck x-ray to exclude neck problems in the light that you had a previous accident and had multiple treatments for it.  Sometimes, gall bladder can give such sensation as well. So, if you have this sensation especially after you eat fatty foods, i recommend that you discuss having a gall bladder ultrasound with your doctor.

The ache seems to be running along the artery in my arm, I know it is an artery as when I applied pressure to it the pulse stopped in my right hand :S So I am not syre whether it is narrowed  or a blood clot is in there or something :S somehing nastry is going on. The pain is there when I move my arm. It is a very subtle pain nothing major just enough to know it is there. I have had a thyroid check that is not under active or overactive, and I have had various other tests done. I am worried it is a problem with my artery in myright arm :s or something. Also been getting under my collar bone or just under there like nasty pains and like a stich feeling in my left side, about half way down. Also currently got a slow pulse about 66 - 72bpm and also been getting pains around my left shoulder near my back too prob where the artery goes through not sure! I am really concerned over the feeling it iss possible it is muscular but I also worry that me applying pressure to the artery has caused it to become worse perhaps causing bleeding and a clot or something :S it feels farily flexable,   also my pulse in my left hand is fairly strong still, I had to push down quite a bit for it to stop so there an't be too much of a narrowing? can there. Have I caused damage to myself? Also I am going to book in for  a 24 hour monitoring of my heart rate ECG or EKG tomorrow If I can.\n\n",

    "content": "Quick background:  Black woman, thirties, had problems with serious anemia due to fibroiids. Had UFE procedure in 2002. Since the excessive bleeding has been arrested but there have been signs that the problem may be returning. Around the same time, after two months of terrible coughing and horrific right side chest pressure pains, I was diagnosed as an asthmatic  UPDATE:  The  dry persistent cough continues unabated.  Seems better at  night, but the moment  I am and moving, it begins again.  There are times when the coughing triggers a terrible headache.....  As a result fo the above condition, my physical condition deteriorated.  While I appear strong, overall muscle strength  and cardio are  abysmal. Attempts to  regain soime reasonable state of fitness are hampered as a result of my not being able to 'do' anything without breathing  difficulty and/or chest pain.  I had been trying to increase fitness but the blood pressure issue is a problem. If I began any kind of cardio work, I had a tightness in the chest area..   Right now,  I am dealing with a tightness that is situatied around both sides of my throat and if feels as though there is some heavy tension on/around my collar bone area..  My GP believes this is simple stress; I do not.  It is unlike anything I have encountered so I know it is not 'normal'..  I do not have any headaches and while I feel I could go and play a game of squash, I know that after three minutes I would be on the floor panting and clutching my  chest..  Interesting though: of late I have developed a hypersensitiivity to salt.  Even though I  am trying to follow the DASH diet, I find even the smallest amounts send me running with the worst headaches imaginable.  This is a recent occurence.  I have just started taking ATALAT 30MG  I have been on them for about 20 days.  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated..\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Justina,  Females of the child bearing age are naturally protected against coronary disease unless they have had major risk factors for coronary disease for a long period of time. You have intermittent smoking and hypertension (but the hypertension has not been there for that long) as major risk factors for coronary disease and the characteristics of the pain that you are describing are somewhat atypical as compared to those of chest pain related to coronary disease. So, the probability of this pain being due to coronary disease is low.   The chest tightness that you get can be due to your asthma and is actually not pain but difficulty breathing. There is an entity called exercise induced asthma. i would recommend that you try an inhaler before you exercise and see whether this makes a difference.  The feeling that you have (tightness at your collar bone) in addition to the chest pain and even the asthma especially if you have night attack can all be due to acid reflux disease. i recommend that you try anti-acid medications and see if this is going to help.  If you still continue to have this pain, then i would recommend that you see an ear, nose and throat specialist to have a look down your throat and see what is wrong.  Regarding the headache that you have been having, i am not sure what atalat is as this is the trade name but if it is the same as adalat (nifedipine) then this medication is well known for causing headaches.

    "content": "Dear fooll2,  It is unpredictable when you are going to have your next attack of psvt. You never had any problem with dizziness or syncope the first two times, but no one knows how your body will react to the next attack.  The surgical procedure is not really a surgery. It is an invasive procedure. It does not involve opening your chest or any thing of the sort. It is done by passing a special catheter through your groin vein to the heart where the electrical activity of your heart is recorded and mapped. This will show if you have an accessory pathway or not and at the same time ablate this pathway by radiofrequency. You can go home the next day if all goes well. No procedure is without complications of course and it could involve bleeding, failure of the procedure, injury to any of the blood vessels of the groin amongst others.  i am not sure how long you are going to be in China, but i am sure that in Shanghai, they have very good cardiologists that can take of you if anything happens and even do this procedure if you need it.  There are medications that can can be given for psvt, i think if you are going to be in China for a short period of time, may be it is a good idea to have them and when you come back, may be you should think about having this procedure.

You don't have any major risk factor for coronary disease and the characteristics of the pain that you are describing (left arm/elbow pain) are absolutely atypical as compared to those of chest pain related to coronary disease. So, the probability of this left arm/elbow pain being due to coronary disease is very low. You never mentioned the characteristics of the pain that you had in the past, but you had a normal coronary angiogram which is the gold standard for diagnosis of coronary disease, so you definitely didn't have coronary disease then and you still don't have it now since your risk factors are still the same and the pain characteristics are atypical. Did you have a ventriculogram with your coronary angiogram? Did it show that you had mitral valve prolapse?  i suggest that you have a neck x-ray/ct scan to exclude cervical neck problems that you might have.  i usually don't like to blame stress or anxiety attacks for symptoms but if your probability of having coronary disease is very low to begin with and you had a normal coronary angiogram, and every thing else turns to be normal, then this is most probably anxiety and i think you need to see a psychiatrist or at least have an anti-anxiety medication.

    "content": "Dear Chris,  To determine whether or not chest pain is due to coronary disease, major risk factors that the patient has for coronary disease and the characteristics of the pain are looked at and then the probability of the pain being due to coronary disease is determined.   Regarding your major risk factors, you did not say how old was your father when he had his first heart attack (if was below 50 years then you have a positive family history as a major risk factor), you said you drink on weekends, do you smoke?   The characteristics of the pain that you are describing are absolutely atypical as compared to those of chest pain related to coronary disease. So, the probability of this pain being due to coronary disease is very low.   The symptoms that you are describing could be due to: 1. Neck problems. Very common cause of chest pain. i recommend having a neck x-ray/ct scan to rule out any problem. 2. Reflux disease. i would recommend you trying some over the counter anti-acids, as reflux can sometimes present with real strange symptoms (without even having heart burn).  If the pain comes only once a year, i would not really worry about it unless it becomes more frequent or start changing its characteristics be becoming more severe or more persistent.

    "title": "Young female with persistent chest pain",
    "content": "Hello,  I am a 30-yr-old woman, nonsmoker, not overweight with normal blood pressure (102-120/80-86), cholesteral levels (184 total), and rather healthy.  Problem is, I've had persistent chest pain for 2 years.  It started out of the blue one day while sitting at my desk at work.  It was a dull ache under the breast bone that would radiate out to both armpits.  I would have it every single day and it would last all day long.  I went to a cardiologist who gave me an EKG and stress echo ~ he said I passed with \"flying colors.\"  Well, the chest pain persisted.  I started to get used to it because it was present all the time; however, there was always a niggling fear that I was going to drop dead of a heart attack.  My father had heart disease ~ he had a heart attack at age 42 (but he did smoke for about 30 years prior, believe it or not), then had another bypass at age 60 (to avoid 2nd heart attack), then had a stroke at age 66, then died of brain aneurysm last year at age 68.  My father's brother also has had heart disease, but he is also a smoker (but still alive at age 70).  This is the only history of heart disease that I know of, and since I am not a smoker nor overweight like my dad and uncle, I'm hoping that is in my favor.  Anyway, I took Lexapro for anxiety (I've had it all my life unbeknownst to me; in full swing since late 2000) and it really helped with the dizziness and panic, but not the chest pain.  I am currently off the Lexapro (for a year now), but since I've been off, my anxiety has gotten worse, my hypochondriac has taken over my life and my heart fears have escalated.  My chest pain will now disappear for a few days at a time, but always comes back.  Now, though, I get the chest tightness and the constant need to take deep breaths.  I also cannot lie on my back without my chest feeling very heavy.  I have left arm/armpit area pain that will throb on and off (and can even feel pain in my ring finger at the same time).  I have zap-like pains in my neck on both sides.  I have jaw pain, primarily on left side, but sometimes on right (but I also have TMJ, so this could be the cause).  I have tooth ache pain all the time ~ all in my mouth, can't tell what tooth it is coming from and occurs on top, bottom and both sides simultaneously ~ dentist shows no problems.  I also have back pain (will get chest pain that goes through to my back, as well as the left armpit area pain that goes through to my back).  Also, if I talk for long periods of time, my jaw hinges will ache and I get an uncomfortable lump in my throat (like an ache).  I have had a CT Scan of my chest that was normal ~ thyroid and trachea normal, everything in proper alignment and size, lungs clear, bones ok, no lesions or tumors.  Then I had x-rays of my cervical spine to see if I had stenosis that might be causing my neck/arm pain.  They were normal.  Doctor recommended an MRI but I have not done it yet because of the expense.  I am fearful all the time and not sure if what I have is truly heart related or anxiety/stress related or my hypochondria taking me for a ride.  My mother is extrememly healthy and a non-basketcase (ha!), so I'm hopeful that I've taken after her in the health department.  Your comments will be greatly appreciated!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dianna,  Females of the child bearing age are naturally protected against coronary disease unless they have had major risk factors for coronary disease for a long period of time. You only have one major risk factor for coronary disease which is positive family history (and you are doing great by leading a healthy life style) and the characteristics of the pain that you are describing are atypical as compared to those of chest pain related to coronary disease. So, the probability of this pain being due to coronary disease (having a heart attack) is very low.   i recommend to have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to look for mitral valve prolapse. This is a condition which is very common in young otherwise healthy females which is very notorious of causing atypical chest pain. It only needs to be followed if you have it and the pain can be controlled with some medications of the beta blockers type.  The symptoms that you are describing (pain under your arm extending to your chest) could be due to: 1. Neck problems. Your x-ray of the spine was ok. i think you can have a ct scan of the neck (which is less expensive than an mri) specially with the zap like pains that you get. 2. Shingles infection or a condition known as post herpetic neuralgia (pain after shingles) even if you did not have a typical case of shingles. The armpit area pain can be due to this. 3. Reflux disease. i would recommend you trying some over the counter anti-acids, as reflux can sometimes present with real strange symptoms (without even having heart burn).  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello I am a 21 year old female that has had anxiety for since I was around 13. I am not the average 21 year old considering I have worked and lived alone since I was 13. IWhat I am concerned about is the chest pain I have been getting for over a year. It sometimes is tightness, sometimes going down my left arm. I also get sort of breath. I work all day on computers and when I get home eat dinner and watch tv so I do not have a very active lifestyle. Whenever I do exercise my chest tightens up and I get short of breath. I was told that was from lack of exercise and smoking. I have smoked a pack a day on and off for about 5 years. I have been to almost every doctor around the place I live and am always told it is anxiety. I have had chest x-rays done, blood counts checked, I also had an echocardiagram done.The only thing they have told me is that I have inflammation of the chest wall and to take Naproxen. What bothers me is that the doctors never take me seriosly and they hardly ever do an EKG. I went in for shortness of breath and chest pain and they sent me home with a paper that said: You are short of breath   They look at my age and gender and dismiss me. What I need to know is does this sound like a heart related problem or sould I just get on some anti-anxiety meds? Thank you.\n\n",

You don't have any other major risk factors for coronary disease besides smoking and your chest pain has atypical features.

The shortness of breath and chest tightness as you describe can actually be bronchial asthma. i would recommend that you have a methacholine challenge test to prove or disprove the presence of asthma.

    "title": "Anxiety or heart disease?",
    "content": "I apologize in advance for the length of this post.   I have a long history of vascular disease since age 32, which includes 2 coronary bypass surgeries at ages 36 and 37, bifemoral bypass at age 51, and aortobifemoral bypass at age 52.  At age 52, I was also diagnosed with an ascending aortic aneurysm approximately 3.6 cm (I am currently 54).  After the aortobifemoral bypass, I had severe fatigue, severe shortness of breath on exertion, loss of appetite, ascites, and stomach pain.  I was told after an echo that I had moderate tricuspid regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension.  I was also told after a pulmonary function test that I had mild emphysema.  Cardiologist said breathing symptoms were due to \"deconditioning,\" and liver symtpoms could possibly be hepatitis. Gastrointerologist said no hepatitis, symptoms were due to right-sided heart failure.  Bottom line, with Lasix, Potassium, and Cozaar, symptoms became gradually better over a period of about six months, and medications were discontinued - the condition, I was told, had resolved.  Over the last several months, I have been having episodes of what I can only describe as anxiety - a \"rush\" in my chest, a sudden, startled feeling with rapid breathing, flushing/sweating, sometimes rapid heartrate.  This is particularly annoying at night as it abruptly wakes me up - sometimes several times, although it happens during the day, too, but not as frequently.  Sometimes I awake with a headache that lasts about an hour.  I had been under some stress some months ago but not currently.  I explained the symptoms to my cardiologist last fall, and he said it was probably sleep apnea, and I should make an appointment with the sleep clinic.  Since I don't snore, I didn't think this was a likely diagnosis.  Frankly, I felt at the time that stress could be the culprit and something like Xanax might be helpful.    Since then the symptoms persist, although not as frequently.  I tried taking over-the-counter Valerian Root, but it really didn't seem to help.  I also considered the possibility that this could be menopausal symptoms - however, I began menopause in 1998, with all the symptoms of hot flashes and night sweats, and have not had them in two or three years.  This month I see a new primary physician.  I intend to explain the problem at that time.  I'm afraid, however, he is going to refer me back to the cardiologist. That's a problem for me, however, because  I don't have much trust in the cardiologist.  Unfortunately, I live in a small town, and there isn't a choice of cardiology practices.   So I'm sort of stuck since I really don't want to discuss my lack of trust with the primary doc.  Still, these symptoms worry me, and it's getting scarier as time goes on.  I just want to be sure that this is, in fact, just anxiety and nothing more serious.  FYI, I'm currently taking Toprol XL, Zocor, Plavix, Zetia, Nitrospray, Aspirin, B6, B12, Folic Acid, Omega 3, Coenzyme Q10, and Polisocanol.  I try to exercise 3 to 4 times a week (30 minutes waking, 30 minutes weights), and I am not overweight.  I did not have high cholesterol until about three years ago - the medication now seems to be controlling it.  I quit smoking age 40 and do not drink.  I appreciate any information you can provide.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear mesu,  Are you having episodes of sudden diarrhea?  Your symptoms of sudden flushing, sweathing, tachycardia and rapid breathing makes me think of a rare disorder called carcinoid syndrome. This is in combination with the tricuspid regurge.  It is quite rare and should not be the first thing to jump to mind but i think it should be considered. Have you ever been told about the cause of the right sided heart failure that you developed after your surgery?   A sleep study was a trial to come to the diagnose of this right sided heart failure, i assume.  i don't think that it should be a problem if you mention to your primary doctor that you don't like to be seen by the cardiologist and that if he does not mind, you would like to be seen in a bigger center for a second opinion, i don't think that he will be offended by that.  Carciniod syndrome involves the release of a hormone in the blood called serotonin amongst others. A high level of the breakdown products of this hormone detected in the urine is usually dignostic.  Please, discuss these symptoms with your doctor and see what he thinks.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "Thanks so much for your reply and the information on carcinoid syndrome.  I'll definitely discuss this with my new primary physician when I see him.  In response to your questions -  <Are you having episodes of sudden diarrhea?>   Yes, I have had more frequent episodes of diarrhea in recent years.  Frankly, I didn't think much of it - simply chalked it up to menopause and age.  I understand that further symptoms of carcinoid syndrome can include wheezing, high/low blood pressure, and weight loss.  I have had no wheezing, blood pressure is controlled with Toprol XL 50 mg (~110-120/70), and weight gain has become a bigger problem than weight loss.   <Have you ever been told about the cause of the right sided heart failure that you developed after your surgery?>  As I mentioned in my previous post, the tricuspid regurgitation, right-sided failure, and related symtoms resolved in about six months following aortofem surgery.  I discontinued the lasix, potassium, and Cozaar at that time and have had not had similar symptoms since.  I did ask the cardiologist if the regurgitation was a result of the surgery.  He said it was not, and went on to explain the mechanics of the valve but never really said what caused it in the first place.  It was my understanding that when the symptoms resolved so did the regurgitation and right-sided failure.  Am I wrong about this?  I have not had any tests done since that time except an EKG.    Thanks, again, for the information.  You've been very helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear mesu,  Thank you very much for the update.  Right sided heart failure is rarely primary, i.e. due to right ventricular failure. It is usually secondary to a problem either in the lung or the left ventricle.   Where you given any blood thinners during these 6 months? Did you have a ct scan of the chest to rule pulmonary embolism at any point?  If the symptoms subsided, most probably the right sided heart failure improved, but i would still recommend that you have a follow up echocardiogram.

Since Oct 1st 2004 I have had a pain in my chest, pain under my left shoulder blade, a weak left arm with dull pain, and since Nov 9th 2004 ringing in both ears.  I saw my family doctor who ordered a Holter monitor, blood test and EKG, all which seemed to be fine. Later he referred me to a cardiologist who did an exercise stress test which again seemed to be fine. Since these symptoms have begun I have had occasional chest pain when I wake up in the morning and persistent back pain and awareness of my own heartbeat. Physical activity seems not to affect the pain. I am very scared since I am only 22. Can coronary diseases start this young? Also I am concerned about the ringing in my ears, which I hear can be a side effect of high blood cholesterol. I will go back to my family doctor to check my good and bad cholesterol. Also, my mother died at the age of 38 from circulatory problems to some of her major organs. Besides cholesterol is there any other tests I should be perusing, or is it just stress? Thanks for listening.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I'm 21 and have been diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse, as well as anxiety disorder and recurrent depression. I have chest pain quite often. Most recently (about 10 minutes ago) I had very severe left sided chest pain that only lasted a few seconds. It was more of a squeezing pain. It got me worried, and eventually I found this site. The pain faded away, as I said, in a few seconds, but it left me with a cold feeling in my left shoulder, a tight feeling in my jaw, and tingling fingers on my left hand. I also have palpitations quite often (though less than I used to since I have almost completely quit caffiene). I've been to a cardiologist and had an exercise stress test and bubble study done, both of which came back clear save for the prolapse. I also have, admittedly, very bad posture. Normally while I'm at the computer I sit with my knees up to my chin, for upwards of an hour or two at a time. That has me afraid that I may get a blood clot or something. I also get numbness between my shoulders. I guess my question is, should I still worry about having a heart attack? I know I'm very young to be worrying about it....And if I shouldn't worry, then what could be causing my symptoms? Is it just the prolapse? Or a combination of the prolapse and the anxiety?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear SeraphisCain,  Mitral valve prolapse is notorious for causing atypical chest pain. So, the pain that you have is most probably due to the prolapse.  The pain can also be due to neck problems that you are starting to develop based on the posture that you take when you sit to your computer. Blood clots do not develop that easily in the otherwise active person that just sits to his computer for a couple of hours taking a certain posture.  Chest pain due to mitral valve prolapse may be controlled by medications. You have a little bit of a rapid pulse that might be due physical inactivity. These medications will be helpful in controlling this rapid pulse as well.  i don' think that you should worry about this pain being due to a heart attack especially that you had a negative stress test.

    "content": "Hello, I am new to this forum and am really feeling like my problem can not be solved.. I have constanst chest pain (feels like a MAC truck is parked right on my breastbone) that started over a year ago. So far I have done the following  4 ER visits ( EKG's, Xrays and blood work), I have seen 2 diff. family practice doctors and one highly regarded Cardiovascular doctor, at his office I have had stress tests, ekgs and echo tests with an ultrasound device. My cardiologist has found nothing wrong with my heart after all this and in fact said all looked good, he has put me on Diovan cause my blood pressure was hoovering around 140/85..  I do suffer from anxiety but I feel most of the anxiety comes from this chest pain.. when I take my xanax the chest pain does seem to get a little better but does not go away. My chest pain does not get worse with deep breaths or coughing. The chest pain is so severe that I do not exercise anymore for feer I might collapse/ witch probably causes more anxiety..  So I am 26 and I feel like everyday might be my last here on earth. ANY advise would be greatly appriciated, I have given up hope that any family practice doctor can help me, they usally just throw anti depressants at me... I do not feel depressed so why would they do that? In fact I love life and just want to get rid of this chest pain. They have put me on Zoloft and Lexipro in the past, both of which just flat out made me feel worse.. If any doctors that read this board have any ideas that may help I would love to hear them.

    "content": "Dear Bryan,  You don't have any major risk factor for coronary disease (hypertension has to be there for a while before it starts affecting the blood vessels), and the chest pain is atypical, so to begin with, the probability that this pain is due to coronary disease is very low. On top, you had a negative stress test, so, you don't have coronary disease.  Did your cardiologist mention anything about mitral valve prolapse on the echocardiogram? It is a condition that is notorious for causing atypical chest pain.  Have you tried any medication for this pain besides the ones that you mentioned?  Other causes of chest pain include: 1. Neck problems. i suggest that you have a neck x-ray to exclude neck problems. 2. Acid reflux disease (alone or as a part of a condition called hiatal hernis). i suggest that you have a trial of anti-acids to see whether it is going to help.  If it does not happen, i recommend that you be seen by a gastro-enterologist to decide whether or not you need an endoscopy. 3.

    "content": "I have been to several doctors with being off balanced, dizzy , feeling faint but not actually fainting. I have a resting pulse of around 80 to 84 but when I stand my heart rate jumps anywhere from 104 to 140. My Dr had me wear a Holiter monitor which showed no abnormalties, however, he stated I did have a fast heart rate most of the time and prescribed me Inderal 20 mg and Effexor37.5mg. But I'm thinking that if my heart is beating fast when standing maybe it's due to blood pooling and if I take the beta blocker to slow my heart down what if my blood can't get to where it needs to be. I am just really confused been dealing with this for about 3 yrs and symptoms are becoming very debilitating. Any suggestions?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Havenallen,  If this has not been done yet, i recommend checking a thyroid function blood test to make sure that your thyroid gland is not hyperactive.  Regarding the beta blockers, they are used in cases of tachycardia and they can cause low blood pressure, but if your symptoms are debilitating, i would suggest that you follow your doctor's advice but if you are worried, you can discuss with him/her to start at a lower dose and see the response.  There is a condition called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (pots) that causes increase in the heart rate in the first 5 minutes of standing by more than 28 beats per minute and its treatment is either to take beta blockers or fludrocortisone and is diagnosed by a tilt table test.

    "content": "For the past few weeks, I have been having burning sensations and stabbing pains in my chest. The pain radiates into my back and shoulder and sometimes I have burning pains in my left arm without having any pain in my chest. I went to the doctor who checked my blood pressure and heartbeat and pulse. I had been taking aspirin for a few days and he said that all were normal. The doctor diagnosed GERD and gave me medicine for that. The pain hasn't really got any better, so I went back today and he still thinks that it is GERD. I also told him that I sometimes feel extremely hot and occasionally it will feel as if my heart skips a beat. I am also very tired and on occasion feel very weak. After coming out of the doctors room, I decided to test my blood pressure myself with the machine in the waiting room. If I am reading the monitor correctly, it says that my blood pressure was 153. I am extremely worried that this is related to my heart and that I am about to have a heart attack. I am female, 30 and overweight. Please advise. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Need advice,  Females of the child bearing age are naturally protected against coronary disease. You don't have major risk factors for coronary disease and the chest pain that you are suffering from is atypical as compared to pain of coronary origin. The probability that you have coronary disease (and subsequently heart attack) is very low.  Having higher blood pressure for once does not mean that you will have a heart attack immediately.  i recommend that you have an echocardiography (ultrasound of the heart) to exclude a condition called mitral valve prolapse. It is very notorious for causing atypical chest pain and palpitations. It just needs to be watched.  i recommend that you have a neck x-ray/ct scan to rule out neck spine problems which can cause chest pain as well.  The burning sensation is usually an indication for gerd. Try gerd medications at higher doses or switch to a stronger medication.

    "title": "Differentiating Between Palpitations And Muscle Spasms",
    "content": "I was just wondering if it's possible to tell the difference between chest muscle spasms and palpitations, without various tests and such? I have been having some sensations in my chest that I would classify as one or the other, but I'm not sure which it is. I'm not sure if the sensations can be classified as palpitations, as I've always thought that palpitations are what happens when the heart rate is extremely fast. That isn't what I'm experiencing though. At least not continuously.  These sensations are strong, and basically feel like something is spasming in my chest--I really don't know how else to describe it. Earlier I stated that I don't have a fast heart beat continuously when these sensation occurs. I don't know if this is my heart or muscles. But when they happen, the sensations are fast in quality. Basically I'd say they feel like someone is squeezing me, but doing squeezing faster than normal for several seconds in a row. If that makes any sense?  They occur on the inner side of my left pec/breast, and are accompanied by pain from time to time. I have also been having similar sensations in the right side of my neck, in the lower part near where the neck and upper chest meet.   These sensations are not brought on, worsened, or alleviated by rest, activity, or sitting/laying/standing in various positions. They just happen out of the blue, regardless of the situation. I'm not overly concerned about them being related to anything serious. But the fact that it's been happening for a while now is becoming bothersome. I'm hoping to avoid a dr's trip, but will do so if advised. Therefore, any advice and insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for any time and help on this matter.\n\n",

If you are not having the palpitations while you are being examined, your doctor might not find anything abnormal with the pulse, or he/she can find abnormal pulse and yet you are not feeling it which is very common.  Palpitations can be felt in the neck as two of the major blood vessels coming out of the aorta pass through the neck and these are the carotid arteries. So, if you have palpitations strong enough, they can be transmitted to the neck to the carotids. i can not say whether or not you can specifically feel it in the right lower side.

The part about feeling palpitations in the neck is quite interesting. I figured they would be confined to the area of the heart. Regarding that though, is it possible to feel these sensations independent of each other--meaning if these are indeed palpitations that I've been having, can I feel them in my chest and not in my neck, and then feel them in my neck and not in my chest? I honestly can't remember ever feeling these sensations in both my neck and chest simultaneously. I doubt that helps shed any light on what these sensations are, but I figured it can't hurt to add that.   I will make an appointment tomorrow with my doctor to see him, or visit a local walk-in clinic that I have been to before. Thanks again.  Rob\n\n",

    "content": "I had an Electrophysiology Study done Friday, my doctor had told me that they were going to do ablation to correct damaged tissue in my heart, which causes ventricular tachycardia, and if the ablation were unsuccessful then a pace maker would be implanted. After the test the doctor said I had a healthy heart and sent me home, not having done anything we had discussed. I am confused. I currently have an insertable cardiac loop recorder; it\u2019s like an event recorder under the skin. It has revealed that my black out spells happen moments after my heart rate jumps severely. My rate was recorded at 198 (I fainted in English class) just before the ES procedure was scheduled.  I had previously been diagnosed with Epilepsy, though there seems to be no real basis for this diagnosis. After a year and a half not responding to anticonvulsant meds (not to mention being violently ill most of the time) I switched neurologists and was nearly immediately sent to cardiology, where a mitral valve prolapse and VT were identified.  It seemed like the seizure, fainting, shortness of breath, and frequent black outs had been linked to the heart... but my cardiologist says its healthy. I don\u2019t understand. I have also done the tilt table testing which was normal... is there anything you can think of to explain my symptoms and apparently healthy racing heart? I am young, in shape, happy, and eat well. I just don\u2019t understand! Jessica\n\n",

I don't think that's related to my current problem, but I thought you should know.  My problem started last April or May, several weeks after giving birth to my son.  Pain would begin in my lower chest area (perhaps around my diaphragm?) and would intensify greatly as it spread around to my back,  and upward, and around to the sides of my chest.  It REALLY hurt to breathe.  The pain would get so bad that I was doubled over in tears.  This has happened many times since and it has lasts anywhere from five minutes to a half hour each time.  The strange thing is that when the pain stops, it stops immediately and completely--almost like a muscle cramp.  I've been to my general practitioner twice for this and they don't seem very concerned.  They've said that maybe it is a cramp and I should just try stretching (which I have and it hasn't helped) or maybe it's reflux (which I've taken medicine for and it hasn't helped).  Do you have any clue as to what this might be?  It is very disconcerting, and it just doesn't seem normal!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Prettycakes,  You don't have any risk factor for coronary disease and the pain characteristic is atypical as compared to that of pain of coronary origin. So, the probability of this pain being of coronary origin is very low.  The pain that gets worse by breathing is usually caused by inflammation of the membranes surrounding the lung or the heart but the pain is usually continuous and not intermittent like the ones that you have. i recommend that you try anti-inflammatory pain relievers such as aleve, advil and the like to see if it will help. i would also recommend that you have an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart).  From the place of the pain, causes can be abdominal in origin and not cardiac related. So, esophageal causes such as esophageal spasms can be the cause behind this chest pain. They are usually sudden and very intense and go away fast. There are medications that can be helpful and they are smooth muscle relaxants and actually some of them are used in treatment of high blood pressure.

    "content": "I received the report about a stress echo I had 2 weeks ago and I have a couple of questions.  First of all, I had the stress echo because at the time I was having severe SOB for no apparent reason. I got on the treadmill experiencing already shortness of breath and it continued through the entire test. Since then, that symptom has disappeared.  Here's the report:  \"This patient exercised according to the Bruce protocol for a total of 10 minutes achieving a maximal heart rate of 172, which is 94% of predicted maximal rate. Exercise was discontinued due to shortness of breath. No chest pain was provoked by exercise. Blood pressure response to exercise was somewhat blunted. There are no abnormalities of the ST segment on resting EKG and with exercise, there is no ST segment depression or arrythmias seen. Resting echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular wall motion with just trace mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation with right ventricular systolic pressure of 22. With exercise there is increased contractility and no segmental abnormalities provoked.  Conclusions  1. No signs of ischemia in the form of chest pain, ischemic ST  segment depression or wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography.  2. Baseline echocardiogram with color and spectral Doppler  examination reveals normal left ventricular wall motion. No  significant valvular disease, just trace mitral regurgitation and  trace tricuspid regurgitation without evidence for pulmonary  hypertension.  3. Cardiorespiratory fitness classification is good with achievement  of 10 METs   Then it says that I don't need to see the doctor as the test was normal.   My question is, what is exactly trace mitral regurgitation and trace tricuspid regurgitation? Is it something common?   And the other thing I don't understand is the part about the blood pressure response being \"blunted\". I started with a blood pressure of 110/70 and peaked at 112/70. Could that be a problem?   I am a 36 year old female without any health issues in the past. Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Stress echo results",
    "content": "Dear Belini,  Your stress echo is normal.  Heart has 4 chambers, 2 on each side and every 2 chambers are separated by doors (valves), the function of which is to let the blood pass from one chamber to the other in a forward direction but not backwards. The word regurgitation refers to the backwards flow of blood through a valve.  Trace regurgitation of any of the heart valves is sometimes found in healthy patients who have echocardiograms for whatever reason. The machines have become very sensitive now that they pick everything even if this thing was not clinically relevant. You don't have to worry about this one bit.  The normal systolic (upper value) blood pressure response to exercise is to increase up to 160 (in younger patients such as yourself - 200 (in older patients). i am not sure how your blood pressure was obtained during exercise or whether the readings were accurate. The systolic blood pressure not increasing with exercise might have several causes including worse coronary disease (if the patient has coronary disease, which you don't), excessive reduction in systemic vascular resistance or just being dehydrated (i assume that they told you to come fasting on the day of the test).  i don't see any reason to worry about that either.

Obviously, I cannot rule out something as dangerous as a cardiac cause for your chest pain over the internet, but according to your description this chest pain is probably not secondary to coronary disease.  I would recommend that you have a neck x-ray to rule out neck spine problems and an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to rule out mitral valve prolpase.  You might want to try nexium again if it helped the first time.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "title": "Recurrent Chest pain for 6 years",
    "content": "Thank you for taking time to read my post.  I am 26 years old, 6 years ago, after my first child was born, one evening I started feeling a little tickle in the area of my heart, it felt very deep, not skeletal related.  This scared me, I went to the ER, had an EKG and chest x-ray, was told I was fine and sent home.  Had a follow up with my Dr. and she put me on Naproxin and told me it was due to separation of the cartl. between my ribs.  The medication did not help.  The tickle has gone away, or should I say turned into full blown chest pains.  For the past 5 years it has been like a stabbing sensation on the left side of my chest, mild discomfort in my left arm and tingling, which was probably due to anxiety over the pain, pressure like feeling that I can pinpoint on my chest.  I have had numerous EKG's, a stress test, and an echocardio a few years back, everything came out normal, so again I just endured.  You do start to just \"live\" with the pain after so long, my philosophy was if it was't my heart, it isn't so bad, I can live with that.  And I have, up until a few months ago.   My chest pain started to get worse, migrating down under my  left breast, and now I have an extreme burning sensation under my arms, in the area of my lymph nodes, primarily was on the left side and radiating into my arm, but the burning then spread across my chest and into my right arm and nodes there as well.  i do not have any swelling, all of my blood work has come back normal for a cardio screen, and another EKG showed that I have a short Q-wave, but I was told that was nothing to worry about.  I went through a week of this intense chest stabbing pain, and pain in my left shoulder blade, right across from where the pain is on the front of my chest, night sweats, and anxiety, fatigue and nasuea (sp?) and the tips of my fingers were tingly, I also had another chest x-ray and was told that it looked like I had viral pnuemonia,  then it all suddenly started to go away.  I chalked all of this up to the pnuemonia making everything much more intense until last week when it all came back again, only worse, the burning is horrible, I have the stabbing pains on the left side and directly in the middle of my chest, and sometimes over to the right side now as well, my inner arms feel like they are on fire, I am sick from stress and from body exhaustion, I have a stabbing into my left breast on the side, but no the actual breast, just in line with it, the left side of my neck is very achy like I have been running a marathon or something, and my doctor has no idea what it is.  I have not gotten any real answers.  I do work at a computer all day in an office, I am fairly active, single mother with two children who keep me very busy when we are home.  I do smoke cigarettes, but with this last bout have found it even difficult to keep that bad habit as I am naseated most of the time over everything.    Would a short Q-wave be a problem?  What does that mean?  Why do they NOT think it is a problem?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jen,  Females of the child bearing age are naturally protected against coronary disease unless they have had major risk factors for coronary disease for a long period of time. You only have smoking as a major risk factor for coronary disease and the characteristics of the pain that you are describing are absolutely atypical as compared to those of chest pain related to coronary disease. So, the probability of this pain being due to coronary disease is very low.  i recommend to have the echocardiogram (the ultrasound of the heart) repeated to specifically look for mitral valve prolapse. This is a condition which is very common in young otherwise healthy females which is very notorious of causing atypical chest pain. It only needs to be followed if you have it and the pain can be controlled with some medications of the beta blockers type.  The symptoms that you are describing (pain under your arm extending to your chest) could be due to: 1. Neck problems. Very common cause of chest pain. i recommend having a ct scan of the neck and upper back to rule out any problem. 2. Shingles infection or a condition known as post herpetic neuralgia (pain after shingles) even if you did not have a typical case of shingles. But, it is most atypical for shingles to cross the midline except in immunocompromized patients. 3. Other viral infection that caused an inflammation of the muscles and possibly ribs/cartillages. i recommend that you retry stronger pain relievers/anti-inflammatory medications. 4. Even though it is atypical for reflux disease to cause such symptoms, yet i would still recommend you trying some over the counter anti-acids, as reflux can sometimes present with real strange symptoms (without even having heart burn).

    "content": "I am a 25 year old male, 5\"10.5\", 165lbs.  I have been experiencing chest pain and dizziness for about a week now.  While I get bouts of the symptoms all at once, other times i feel completely fine.  On saturday, 19 Feb, 2005, i flew into Newport Beach CA and my right ear never equalized while descending.  i went through excruciating pain which eventually subsided.  that next monday i got very ill.  monday night i lost focus and concentration while tyring to work, got really light-headed, and almost passed out.  i went to my hotel room and slept.  later that night i woke up with extreme nausea.  i forced myself to vomit and was able to fall asleep again.  a few hours later i awoke with nausea again.  i then forced myself to vomit and was able to fall asleep again.  since then i have had the recurring bouts of dizziness, right after a meal.  i have had those moments of dizziness accompanined sometimes by a ringing and often a lack of balance.  i have not noticed a lack of being able to speak.  i also get a pain in my upper left chest area, centered closer to my chest right out from the shoulder joint.  i am not on any medication at the moment.  i went to see my fmaily DR this monday, after getting back into town.  he said that he noticed my right tympanic membrane (ear drum) was sucked in (convexed?).  this was probably due to lower inner ear pressure.  i have a history of inner ear problems, like not being able to go more than 3 feet under water with out intense ear pressute.  my family DR prescribed some prednisone and the use of Rhinocort and Afrin as well as Zithromax if my symptoms persist.  i have an appt with a Ear, Nose, and Throat DR on thursday (March 3 2005).  i also will be getting my blood drawn tomorrow (March 2 2005) to test for low blood sugar, i assume.  i have never had these symptoms before and they have really freaked me out.  the odd chest pain accompanied with the light-headedness and dizziness seem to be affecting me psychologically.  when i get these attacks, i get really scared, because there seems to be no obvious cause.\n\n",

Don't know.   the stomach pain has been about five days now, all of the sudden. The chest pain sometimes feels like an anxiousness...a pressure...don't know how to describe it, and I'm not sure if I had seen the magnet I would have thought it weird.   The stomach pain feels like I'm hungry, or need to go to the bathroom, and sometimes goes away for a short while.  It'll come back daily.  If I eat, it rarely helps.  When I use the bathroom it feels as if I can't get everything out.    Sometimes I can feel the heartbeat in my chest, but it's mainly while I'm reading symptoms online or thinking about this.  I have a slight annoyance in my right tricep ( or around there) and was wondering if this is another sign?    None of my family hadn't had heart problems (that I know of).  My brother and mom have asthma, I do not.   Please help me.  Do you think waiting a little would cause it to go away?  What else could it be?  also how is an EKG done? What does the paitent have to do? Undress? Does it cause pain? Is it expensive? Will Medicaid cover it?   This whole situation is STRESSING me out so much.  I think the problem may be my stomach. It isn't a naseau feeling, but a feeling of emptyness, or something like that. When my stomach doesn't hurt, my chest usually doesn't. Sometimes my throat feels like there is something in it. I think I may be over reacting. I found out that my father had an ECG recently but nothing was abnormal. Maybe this pain runs in the family? I really would not like to be diagnosed with anything, because this would upset me. If I did go in to get tests, it would be next week. I want to enjoy all the time I have without knowing certainly I have a disfunction or disease, etc.  Ok. Basically I wanted to clarify that my throat is now acting up. It feels like there is something in it, a sort of aching feeling. Also, I'm having some slight pains at various spots on my body, that happen for just a second then vanish. I do think that if I had not seen that refrigerator magnet, that I wouldn't feel any chest discomfort. It comes up whenever I think about it. Maybe it is something with my stomach?   I took gas-x a few minutes ago, we'll see what happens.\n\n",

However, nothing can be ruled out over the internet and you are always advised to consult with your physician on such dangerous issues.

Leads are placed on the chest, arms and legs. i am not sure how much it costs and i am not sure whether or not it is covered by medicaid.  Chest pain in young persons can be caused by a heart condition called mitral valve prolapse which has to be watched and is diagnosed by having an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram).

    "content": "I am a 28 year old female, non smoker, non drinker, excercise regularily but do have a office job which involves sitting at a desk using a computer most of the day.  For about 6 months now, my chest has felt very tight with some pain up into the right side of my neck.  The tightness is gone in the morning but comes on during the day.  Somedays is worse than others, some days it isn't there at all.  Excercise either allevieates the tightness or has no effect.  I have not experienced any shortness of breath or dizziness with this condition but it can be moderately painful to take deep breaths on \"bad\" days.    My blood pressure sits at high normal in the doctors office and 120/80 and lower outside (self testing or when taken by other health practitioners).  Had my cholesterol checked about 10 yrs ago and had no issues, energy level is good, not overly fatigued.  Only other abnormality is some dry coughing when tightness is really bad and that the tendons and muscles in my neck are tender on right side of windpipe, directly above collarbone.  This area feels \"tense\" to the touch and pressing on the tense areas sends pain shooting through my neck and into my shoulder.    I would like to assume this is just stress or a neck problem but taking holidays and weekends off don't make the problem go away and I can't think of any neck injury I have sustained.  Personal life is good, very happy in that respect.  Would really like to fix this problem as I have an active imagination and thinking of all the things this could be is probably worse for me that whatever the problem actually is.  (any possibility of Scleroderma - sorry, saw a story on it last week, seemed plausible).    I would appreciate any advise, or strategies you might have.  Thanks Holly\n\n",

So, the probability that this pain be due to coronary disease is low. However, this cannot be ruled out over the internet. Please consult with your physician and have him perform an examination.  However, I think that you might be correct about this pain be due to a neck problem. i would recommend that you have a neck x-ray/ct scan of the neck done to rule out this problem.  Another cause of this chest tightness could be reflux disease (and you don't have to have heart burn). So, i would also recommend that you try some over the counter anti-acids and see if this helps the pain.  If after this trial the pain is till there, i would recommend that you be evaluated by your doctor.

I work 60 hrs a week (self employed in sales, desk job). I\u2019ve had pain, stabbing, and flutter (heart racing) in my upper left side of chest with shooting pain to numbness and tingly down to my fingers for the past month. This occurs at any given time during day or night. I would be sitting, walking, and even lying done. Sometimes the pain is quick and at times the pain is there for several minutes. There is no shortness of breath that occurs however at times I will grab my chest from the blunt sudden bout of pain in my upper chest. My fingers are always cold(guessing poor circulation) About 6 months ago I had a major dizzy spell where literally the whole room turned and the ground felt like it moved (no it wasn\u2019t an earthquake) followed by numbness on left side. I have yet to have another spell like this. However I thought I would bring this to your attention.   My question is, could my symptoms be heart related, stress or at risk for a stroke? Getting  quite concerned.  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear bsoft,  Your symptoms might be due to: 1. Neck spine problem. 2. Heart problem. 3. Stroke related symptoms. 4. A combination of two of the above.  i think you have to be evaluated by a health care professinoal as soon as possible.   i would like to recommend that you have: 1. A ct scan of the neck to exlcude cervcical spine problems.  2. An ultrasound of the heart (echocardigram) to exclude mitral valve prolapse which can be associated with your symptoms. 3. 24 hours heart monitor to rule out arrhythmias as a culprit. 4. A carotid and vertebral arteries doppler (an ultrasound) to assess the blood flow going to the brain.  At this point, i don't think that this pain is due to coronary disease, because you don't have any major risk factor for coronary disease and because your chest pain sounds atypical and i don't think that a stress test will be helpful.

    "content": "Hello,  First let me give you a summary of what has been going on with my health the last month & a half/two months. I'm a 33 year old female. I don't smoke & am not over weight. On January 4 I went to the ER for what I was afraid was a heart attach...chest pain, arm, neck jaw pain. They dismissed this as heart burn. I have since went through wearing a Holter Monitor,  upper endoscope, colonoscopy, barium enema, Hida scan,  abdominal ultrasound, pelvic/abdominal cat-scan,  & am scheduled for another cat scan Friday.  All test have come back normal, except they found a small polyp in the gallbladder... Also a simple cyst & also what they think is a  proteinaceous cyst on my right kidney (which is what the second cat scan is for). They are also sending me to a rehumatologist, because they can't figure out anything & think maybe it's  fibromyalgia. My lower ribs started hurting after the attack that sent me to the ER first & also in the same area under my left rib. Also pain behind right & left shoulder blade. All intermittent. They do think my gallbladder is still a possible culprit for some of the pain, & I can't really disagree--if I eat something greasy it's a bad thing. They want it removed.  Okay--now getting to my current concern. Two weeks ago about 2 Am in the morning I was awaken by a sharp stabbing pain in the center of my chest, just off to the left side. It went away after a minute, but was severe enough to bolt me upright in bed & wake my husband. I did not feel anything till I rolled over the next morning. Felt an aching in my chest & reproduced the pain by pushing on the area that hurt the previous night.  I realize that would not point to cardiac pain, but I have aching that comes on every day for the past two weeks. I get it about once or twice a day...it can happen no matter what I'm doing...setting walking etc.... Sometimes it's to the left center of my chest where the sharp pain was, sometimes it's on the right.  It's not the sharp stabbing pain that brought this all on, but enough that I'm wondering if it could be heart related.  Any help is GREATLY appreciated!  Heather\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Bluestreak,  For one to decide whether or not chest pain is due to coronary disease, major risk factors for coronary disease and characteristics of pain are looked at and then the probability of this pain being due to coronary disease is determined.   Females of the child bearing age are naturally protected against coronary disease (unless they have had many major risk factors for coronary disease for many years). You have one major risk factors for coronary disease (positive family history) and the characteristics of the pain are not typical as compared to those of pain caused by coronary disease. So, the probability of this pain being due to coronary disease is low.  Of all the investigations that you were subjected to, you did not have an x-ray or a ct scan of the neck to check for neck problems which is a common cause of chest pain.  If the chest pain is reproduced on pressure, this points to non-coronary pain and usually points to muskuloskeletal causes such as muscle inflammation or inflammation of the cartilages of the ribs, a condition known as costochondritis. You might want to try over the counter pain medications and anti-inflammatories such as advil, etc...  Other cardiac causes of chest pain include a condition called mitral valve prolapse. Just needs to be watched and needs an echocardiogram to be diagnosed which i recommend you have as well.

Typically it just aches & pushing on my chest does not reproduce anything. Aching typically only last 30 seconds & then disappears. It's strange...  Thanks again, Heather\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Bluestreak,  Thank you very much for the update.  An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart not an x-ray. It visualizes the heart in real time and provides the health care provider with lots of information and is non-invasive.  Not being able to reproduce the pain every time does not mean that it is not related to musculoskeletal causes.  i would recommend you having a neck x-ray/ct scan of the neck (to rule out neck spine problems), an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram to rule out mitral valve prolapse) and trying an over the counter pain reliever to see whether it is going to help with the pain.

I am not sure what is related & what may be coincidental so I\u2019ll provide it all.  It all started with a non-painful pimple type rash across my chest & stomach - highly noticeable after hot shower.  It lasted a week or so, then I had what appeared to be typical cold- runny nose, minor sore throat, etc.  It went away within a week but an unusual chest discomfort developed - a continuous minor pressure in center of chest - sometimes left or right sided.  This lasted months - during the time I also had intense bouts of nausea (no vomiting), intense headaches, and epididimytis (went away w/cipro).  Any time I would try to exercise, about 30-60 minutes afterwards I would get intense feelings of needing to burp - but unable to or very little followed by the chest pain, headache and irritability.    I have had numerous tests: the only sign was abdominal ct scan showed light mesentery lymph adenopathy, otherwise chest x-ray & CT scan ok, treadmill EKG (no echo) ok, upper G.I. ok, scrotal ultra sound OK, blood tests ok including sed, parvo, & EBV.  After 3 months of worsenting chest pain, the past couple weeks it has got better, but still intermittent pains, and every time I do moderate exercise they start up again - and the initial couple hours after exercise is incredibly uncomfortable with need to burp, headache & more significant chest pain all of which seem to last a couple days afterwards.  Please help if you have any ideas, the stress of it all is really starting to wear me down.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Dr. Mokhtar for the prompt and thorough reply, that is more than I expected and I am thankful for it.  In response to your follow up questions:  The pain does not generally come on or increase after eating.  In fact I often feel the chest pain if have not ate for a long time. It is most pronounced lately after excercise, but also hits at different times.  The only clear pattern is that it is almost always best in morning and gets worse by mid-day & lasts till bedtime, with excercise exagerating. One symptom that I forgot too mention is that I have developed an unusual cough in the last month or so too - it is dry, not painful, not hacking... it feels like something is irritated in lower stomach area that causes an involntary expulsion of air more than an irritation in throat causing a cough - if that makes sense.  The cough does seem to be related to eating possibly, as it comes on most signficantly after eating, although I can have it at other times as well.  I have never had any long term type cough before. H.Pylori?  Regarding heartburn, I did try a short period of pepcid (14 day) and later protonix (7-day) treatment in the early stages, but it did not seem to have an impact on the chest pain  I do not have any of the traditional gerd symptoms sch as burning, bitter taste, regurgitation or difficulty swallowing.  I thought about trying some GERD meds again now that many of the other symptoms have diminished.  I have not tried any meds that make the stomach empty quicker, nor have i heard about this type of treatment.  I have not seen a GI doctor yet, nor have I had an echocardiogram.  My doctor has referred me to a I.D. Specialist whom i have not seen yet (he too thinks probably started as something viral - although it is dragging on longer than expected).   Thank you again, if you have any suggestions based on the above new information I would be grateful. Otherwise,  I can provide you an update after my I.D. consultation if you like.\n\n",

Also I had a monometry, catheter inserted through the nose to the stomach - Feb. 15.2005; ultrasound Feb. 14.2005.  I am having pains in my left arm going to the back of my neck down to my chest, the funny thing about it today, I started having numbness right down my left leg and toes. The pain is radiating from my chest (heaviness) to my neck and shoulder blade & down my left leg and toes. That worries me a bit, my physician is 40 miles from here. I would like to really know if it is my heart or my GERD problem. I was given a Nitro pump and I have used it and it seemed to help. The problem is I don't know if I should see a doctor immediately or wait to see if all of this will go away.  Sorry I wrote such a long letter,  Thank you very kindly, Dorine\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Coleen,  Your symptoms sound to me as if the pain you are having is most probably related to your spine rather than a cardiac problem or gerd.  However, you have a major risk factor for coronary disease, but the pain is atypical.   Being taken off of metoprolol can lead to angina or heart attack, but you said you are being weaned under medical supervision and most probably you will be fine.  i don't think that you have to be seen by a physician right away but i would recommend that you call your doctor in the morning and make an appointment to be seen.   If at any point, you think that the pain is getting worse or becomes continuous and you start having sweating and nausea, i would recommend that you go to the nearest emergency department.

Chest pain can also be caused by conditions such as mitral valve prolapse (need to have an echocardiogram which is an ultrasound of the heart to detect this condition) and acid reflux disease.  If you are willing to try over the counter medications for acid reflux and see if it makes a difference, discuss it with your doctor and see what he/she thinks.

    "content": "Hello, For the past ten days I've been expierencing a single semi sharp pain in my upper right chest just below my armpit and behind my shoulder blade. This pain appears anywhere from every two and a half minutes to ten or fifteen minutes.  It will occur whether I'm moving or at rest. I am not disturbed from sleep due to this pain and have noticed it takes almost ten minutes to show itself when get out of bed in the morning.  I monitor my blood pressure everyday and it still averages 120/80 with a average pulse of 80. My Cardiologist has been treating me since 1995 for high colesterol, gout and hypertension with great success. I have an appointment to see my Cardiologist on 3/3/05. However, if I was experiecing this pain on my left side I would of gone to the Emergency Room on the first day. Before the pain arose I began to exercise with ten pound dumbells working up to 60 curls a day in a matter of two to three weeks.  In addition I was doing leg lifts from a prone position working up to 50 a day in the same period of time.  Once the pain appeared ten days ago I ceased all exersise, however the pain has not change its profile.  I'm in good shape and walk a great deal but I need to lose 15 pounds which will bring me to 197 with a height of six feet.  I take a Stress Test every five years and the last one in 2004 was exceeding better that the previous one which was considered very good. From 1995 to 2000 I saw my Cardiologist every four months for a check up and monitoring.  Since 200 I see him every six months due to my excellent response to his treatments.  I appreciate and look forward to your opinion on this matter Thank you for your attension. John\n\n",

Do you notice more discomfort if you eat certain foods? Due to the location of the pain, chest, shoulder blade etc. and if you have the aforementioned symptoms I would be inclined to consider gallbladder disease/dysfunction. If those symptoms are not present it may be muscular in nature. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I am always light headed due to the medication but the pain did not increase my condition. As a matter of fact, since 11pm last night the pain has stopped for the firs time in ten days.  I was using a stop watch to time the pain and before I went to sleep last night the intervals went from 3 minutes to fifteen in a matter of an hour. I will have a blood test on 2/28/05 and will see my Cardiologist on 3/3/05 for a complete check up and will notify you of the results. At the moment, I think the possibility of muscle spasms and or pain might have been the cause. Thank you for your attention.\n\n",

So, the pain that you are having is most probably not related to coronary disease.  i think that what you are complaining from sounds to me more like palpitations rather than chest pain.   Chest pain in the young has multiple causes, one of the most common causes in the young females is a condition called mitral valve prolapse which needs to be followed-up only.  i would advise you to see your doctor and discuss the possibility of having an echocardiogram with him to rule this condition out.

    "content": "I have been having some chest pains for the last couple of weeks.  It is a sharp, achy feel...and seems as if there is a pulling action.  My left fingers ache on occasion when this is happening...and sometimes my left arm hurts a little (again...nothing really bothersome..but in conjunction with the chest pain and location..troublesome).  The pain is not excruiating by any means...and I wouldn't even notice it were it not for the locations.  I have been to the hospital and my tests came back okay (I think something to do with enzymes)...I had x-rays...they were cleared as far as I know...and then my general practioner did a stress test (no carthatization).  The stress test was okay although I did seem to beat twice in rapid succession every once in a while (I have periodic times where I feel like I missed a breath...and my chest is fluttering...but have had those for a while and seems to run in my family a bit).  I also have had problems with my calves when running for eight years...they tighten up almost as if someone put a tourniquet below my knees (similar to what your fingertip looks like if you wrap a rubberband around it)...after a bit of running (used to be almost 3 or 4 miles...now is more likely 1/2 to 1 mile and I tighten up...but that could be because I wasn't running as much as well).  The pain in my calves can be excruiating at times (sharp...typically in the \"hollow\" right between my ankle, achilles and heel)...and other times feels as all the muscles are cramping.  My blood vessels pop out the side of my legs and if running through grass...it feels like cold water is running down the outside of my leg (It feels as if a nerve is exposed...as I can tap in the right place, outside of leg...between 3 & 5 inches above my ankles, and it feels like I'm being mildly shocked.  The pain/cramping/swelling stops when I'm not running (it doesn't do it really if I do elliptical machine or stairmaster)  I am not sure if the two are related but thought that they could be.  I also have problems with digestion but the Privosec (spelling?) my doctor prescribed hasn't stopped the periodic chest pain.  I also am on Synthroid for an underactive thyroid.  I tried to include anything that I thought might be of some help...and I thank you for any advice in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear sjlong_ga,  You have two major risk factors for coronary disease, being a male and smoking. Your chest pain does not sound typical, so your probability of having chest pain is low. You had a negative stress test. So, most probably, the  chest pain is not due to coronary disease.  The chest pain that you are having is most probably related to the trauma that you had in the past.  i have a bias, if a patient has chest pain and he has a negative stress test, i would like this patient to have a neck x-ray/ct scan to rule out cervical spine problems which can be the cause of the chest pain.  The symptoms that you are complaining in your leg is most probably due to not exercising on regular basis and not having an exercise program.  If you have pain in your calves that make you stop running or walking, this could be peripheral vascular disease but i don't think that your symptoms are typical.   i would strongly encourage you to stop smoking and drinking.

    "content": "Please help!!! For about the last two months, I have been suffering from recurrent chest pain that changes locations and sensations. In December, I suddenly got severe pain at the bottom of my rib cage and it hurt when I breathed in. The pain came and went for about a week, and I went to urgent care when the pain was so bad I could barely breathe in or talk. I was diagnosed with atelelactasis resulting possibly from pleurisy or an injury. I took Vicodin and ibuprofin. Soon after, I started to get a \"burning\" sensation that seemed to surround my heart. I went to the doctor and was prescribed Aciphex for GERD although I have very rarely ever even experienced indigestion let alone acid reflux. I was told that the prescription Motrin that I took could have caused the discomfort I was experiencing. Last week, I bent over to put something into a freezer at work. I had a sudden onset of chest pain right under my sternum. This time, the pain was pressure-like in nature and it hurt to breathe in. It persisted for a few days until it moved from the center of my chest more toward the right side and underneath my right breast. Since this afternoon, the pain has relocated once again- to the left side, under my left breast. The pain for the last couple of days has been achy in nature, not burning or pressure-like. In addition to the chest pain, I have been experiencing extreme numbness of my extremities(legs primarily), to the point where I will wake up in the middle of the night and one or both of my legs will be completely numb. My chest pain seems to be worse at night, and when I am lying down or bending over.\n\n",

    "content": "Well this all started a couple of years ago. On the way home from work I had what felt like a huge pressure pushing in the center of my chest, no difficulty breathing. I was terrified and I had my wife take me to the emergency room. I had a normal ecg  but they held me overnight running my enzymes which all came back normal as well. As a precauition they also ran a stress test the next morning which also came back normal.                    About a few months later I was driving to work and got an intense burning sensation in my back and I broke out in a sweat. I drove myself to the emergency room. I told them of my previous visit and this time they ran a nuclear stress test which came back normal.Over the next year I had about 4 more trips to the emergency room which all ended up with a clear bill of health and each time I was told it was a panic attack. At the suggestion of my physician ( to calm my nerves ) I made an appointment with a cardiologist who ran another nuclear stress test ( about 13 months after the first one ) which came back normal as well. I had a follow up with him six months later which was fine and he asked me to make another appointment in a year.          Well for the past week and a half I have been getting random pains throughout my chest,  back and arms. It started when I was away on business for two weeks and everyone came down with the flu. During this time I was getting very hot in my back, neck, arms and head. It would come on very quickly and then last for about 10 to 15 minutes. This went on for two days, stopped and then came back for one night. That was a week ago and it hasn't happened since. The next few days my stomach was a little upset and I was getting a funny sensation in my chest. I haven't had any difficuly breathing or nausua associated with the heat or funny sensation. Tonight on the way home from work I was getting sharp pains in my chest that lasted only a second ot two however they were located  both to the left and right of the center of my chest. I just get so fixated on these things and I let my mind run....  I actually tried to see my primary care physician yesterday but he was away and I saw the covering physician instead. He ordered some blood work which all came back normal with the exception of my cholesterol which was a little hjgh (231). I'm 38 years old  I've never smoked, I'm currently dieting however I am about 70lbs overweight. Diabetes runs in my family however I'm not diabetic.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear jlsteeler,  To determine whether or not chest pain is due to coronary disease, risk factors that the patient has for coronary disease and characteristics of the chest pain are evaluated. You have 1 major risk factor for coronary disease, which is being a male. You don't have high blood pressure, diabetes, you did not mention that you smoke or drink and your total cholesterol is not that elevated and a better measurement would be of the ldl (known as the bad cholesterol) and the hdl (known as the good cholesterol). The chest pain characteristics the first time had some typical features so i think it was a very good idea to have a stress test done before you left the hospital. But since then you had 2 nuclear scans that were normal. So, you don't have coronary disease.  The chest pain that you had this last time is actually atypical as compared to the pain caused by coronary disease. So, you only have one major risk factor and the chest pain that you had this last time is atypical so this pain is not caused by coronary disease and on top you had 2 nuclear scans that were negative. This means one thing, that you don't have coronary disease.  i think that all these problems are related to your neck spine problems.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "I've been having a problem with being short of breath, not in the sense that I am out of shape, but in the sense that my lungs have somehow shrunken.  I feel a dull pain like I am over-filling my lungs whenever I take a deep breath.  I just recently experienced a very sharp pain right where my heart is.  It was stabbing and definitely was well below my skin, into my intercostals.  It sounds a lot like angina, but I don't think that I have the blockage necessary.  At least I hope not.  I've had them before but they are fairly rare and I'm not sure if they are related.    I'm in good shape, frequenting the gym for both cardio and weight lifting, so I'm sure I can rule that out.  I'm a pretty mellow person, so I don't think its stress related.  Despite my health, I have had a few infections in the last several months.  I caught something while on vacation from the water (diarrhea, fatigue, nausea), but it ran its course.  I also had an ear infection, and then strep throat, which were both treated with antibiotics (amoxicillin)   Because of the infections I suspected pleurisy as the source of my pain, but I don't know if they could be related...   It seems to be the only thing that fits the description.\n\n",

    "title": "Unexplained heart problems...",
    "content": "Hello,  I'm 33 years old and I'm a Persian Gulf Vet with Persian Gulf Syndrome and I started having some heart problems last January (2004).  My problems started, literally overnight.  Up until Jan of 04 I had low blood pressure and a low heart rate.  I have noticed some fibrillation (fluttering and eratic heart beat, skipped beats, double beats, sometimes my heart will stop beating for a few seconds, etc.) over the last couple of years though.  In January of last year my heart rate went through the roof.  I have since been diagnosed with Tacycardia (heart rate well over 100 at a rest).  My blood pressure also shot way up.  There was also a significant increase in my fibrillation.  This was also the same time I had my first anxiety attack.  I also started having quite a bit of chest pain at this time.  Last but not least, I started hearing my pulse in my left ear also at this time.  I have been through EKG's, ECG's, several heart enzyme tests, a Thallium stress test (for the stress test my BP and HR went through the roof...they kept asking me if I was OK and I told them I felt fine.  I was on the treadmill for 8-10 minutes going full speed and they finally slowed it down and let me off), a couple of Holter monitor tests, and an Upper GI X-ray after drinking ?ballium?, multiple chest X-rays...and I really cannot think of whatelse.  I've been to the emergency room several times, thinking that I was having a heart attack.  It's gotten to the point now, that I do not go anymore, b/c every time that I've been, there's supposedly been nothing wrong...  According to my Doc, all of my tests checked out within normal ranges.  I do have a mild case of esophogeal reflux disease.  He said that my problems are probably the result of a Chemical imbalance of some kind.  He said he saw no signs of heart disease.  He said that all he could do was to treat my symptoms.  I was on 50 mg of Atenolol to help with the tacycardia, fibrillation, and elevated BP.  They just reduced that to 25 mg, b/c I am gaing quite a bit of weight, and the meds are slowing me down.  I take .5 mg of clonazepam daily for the anxiety and 10 mg of cyclobenzaprine for my back...to help me sleep.  With little or no exertion, my heart rate and BP are both still staying in normal ranges (132/77 P-78 ) but with significant exertion both are going up kind of high.  I am also still having chest pains with exertion.  Most of the time these pains are on the left side just below my pectoral muscle.  These pains are usually very brief, and sharp stabbing pains.  Occasionally they will be center or right, but most of the time they are on the left.  To give an example, I just finished splitting some wood (30-40 minutes of moderate exercize) and I took it easy.  I had several chest pains on the left side while splitting.  My BP before I started was 131/74 P-68.  Immediately afterwards it was 144/79 P-99.  Thirteen minutes later it was 137/83 P-103 and 38 minutes after that it was 140/80 P-96...this while all at a rest.  I took it real easy while splitting the wood...I was not working myself hard at all.  I know these levels are not significantly high, but they get higher with more exertion...and the chest pains concern me quite a bit.  I'm a contractor and I do hard physical labor for a living.  The other day my BP was running 140/91 with a heart rate up to 100 and it was an easy day at work...just doing light trim work.  I honestly believe that my heart problems are Persian Gulf related and all of my care has been through the VA center.  What I want to know is: Does a normal person's BP go up high with exertion?  What could possibly be the cause of my chest pains with exertion?  I have not been having the problems with anxiety for quite a while now, so I do not believe my problems are related to this.  All of my problems seemed to have started overnight.  My chest pains have me the most concerned.  They can be best described as being short, stabbing, sharp pains, just below and underneath my left pectoral muscle.  Sometimes they will kind of wrap around the left side of my chest (under my left arm).  I also suffer from shortness of breath, but this is definitely Persian Gulf related.  The doc's at VA are very tight lipped and will not give me very much information.  Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you in advance.  I would also like to add that at night while sleeping, I can be laying completely flat on my back or stomach and my arms and hands will go completely numb and wake me up.  They get so bad that I cannot move them at times...I think this must be related to circulation some how.?.?  Edited to better describe my chest pains and to provide some additonal information.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm still searching for an answer.  I just spent about an hour splitting wood again today and I had a few sharp pains in the center of my chest...kind of felt like they were in my breast bone.  They were sharp and brief.  About an hour after splitting the wood by BP was up to 140/85 P-80.  Should physical exercize cause my BP to rise???  Is this normal?  I know it's not significantly high, but I've been told that any time your lower BP number is 85 or, you are doing permanent damage to the organs in your body.  I'm also looking for an answer as to what could be causing the chest pains.  They are always stabbing, brief pains...but they worry me...and 95% of the time they come with exertion.  I would greatly appreciate any insight that the doctors could give me.  I do not have health insurance, so my medical care is very limited.  Thank you again!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Eric,  First of all, i am not familiar with pursian gulf war syndrome, so i will not be commenting on it and whether or not the symptoms that you have are related to it in any way.  From what you said, i think that you don't have coronary disease. i think that the chest pain that you are suffering from is most probably related to localized muscular causes in the chest wall. This being said, however, i have a bias, any patient who has chest pain that proves not to be due coronary disease, i would like them to have a neck x-ray/ct scan to rule out cervical spine problems. If the pain that you are describing as sometimes goes around the back under your arm is always in the same place (when it comes to the skin), then this could be due to shingles infection in the past even if you did not have an obvious one with pain and rash.  Regarding the tachycardia and the increase in heart rate whether at rest or with exercise and the sudden start in the symptoms, if not already done, i would like to suggest to have a thyroid function test done. There are some rare diseases that can cause sudden increase in blood pressure, heart rate and even a panic attack like sensation that some times are not looked for by physicians because they are so rare and it is a hassle sometimes to diagnose them properly. These diseases include a disease called pheochromocytoma (tumour that secretes adrnaline into the blood) and another one called carcinoid symdrome (another tumour that secretes a substance called serotonin in the blood).  Usually, systolic blood pressure (the above number goes up progressively until it reaches 160 (in young patients) - 200 (in elderly patients). The lower number does not significantly change or may be minimally decreases.  After exercise, heart rate and blood pressure should go back to their original values. If the patient is of the athletic type, blood pressure and heart rate changes will go back to their original values faster.  From the blood pressure that you have, you might have high blood pressure, but the diagnosis of high blood pressure relies on having 3 high readings on 3 different occasions within the same week (meaning 3 different days) with the patient relaxed and not after exercise.  Atenolol is a medication that can control the blood pressure but if it is not controlling your blood pressure then you might want to discuss it with your doctor to increase the dose.

    "content": "Thank you very much for the reply Doctor!  I do have a bad back and neck from a car wreck a few years ago...so there could be some problems there.  I will look further into this.  I also had a very brief and mild case of shingles last year (this popped up at the same time I had a strep infection in a sweat gland).  They operated on the gland and the shingles appeared shortly after that.  The shingles were not located in the same area of my body as the chest pains though.  I believe they did a thyroid test on me, but I will check into that too.  I have been diagnosed with high blood pressure...it was significantly higher before being put on BP meds.  I went through 3 different kinds of meds before finding that Atenolol worked very well for me.  They just recently reduced my dosage, b/c of weight gain and the fact that it was slowing my body down so much.  The reduced dosage of 25 mg seems to be working for the most part.  I am keeping a log to show my VA Dr when I go back in to see her next month.  Thank you VERY much for your time and insight Doctor...it is greatly appreciated!     You've given me some hope that my chest pains may not be heart related.  It can be very unnerving to think you could be on the verge of a heart attack with any type of physical exertion...especially when you are as active as I am.  You doc's are doing a great thing here on this site!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dawn,  The continuous tingling and chest pain that you have might be due to: 1. Part of the symptoms of panic attacks. 2. A new tia related symptom. 3. Something unrelated to either such as neck problems. 4. Coronary disease. The probability that this chest pain could be due to coronary disease is most probably low as the chest pain that you have is atypical as compared to that of chest pain secondary to coronary disease. Having said that, however, you have a history of high cholesterol and had a tia which mean that you most probably have diseased arteries whether in the brain (tia) or heart (coronary disease). So, i would recommend that you talk to your doctor about this pain and see whether or not he/she thinks that a stress test is required.

Have you had a methacholine challenge test to detect asthma? 2. Reflux disease. i would recommend that you try an over the counter anti-acid. 3.

Regarding your tooth problem, i think that your dentist can pull your tooth out without problems but as usual you will have to take antibiotics prophylaxis to prevent infection of the diseased valves.  i can not tell you exactly what is causing your symptoms but it can be related to your palpitations, if they are fast, they can lead to this fainting like feeling and the dizziness.   These symptoms can also be caused by progression of certain valve lesions (but i don't know what kind of heart lesion you exactly have).

Not sure what it is, if it is heart I want it sorted! or something done, Just really gets to me that it could be something but nothing can really be said about it until it happens! Which is scary. So guess I just have to wait till I drop dead in agony from a heart attack or heart failour or something!?\n\n",

Not sure if he was overweight or not, not sure on any other details other than that... But! It has sent alarm bells ringing to me! and my Dad! The pains I have beengetting like now pain in my left shoulder like just underneath it! and same with the right! Arm pain like between wrist and elbow on my left arm, and also between my embow and my shoulder. I have also noticed slight irregular heart beats at times, and also like a sucking (making me want to breathe in) sensation for a second, and like muscular spasms in my chest near the centre of my chest but... to the left a little! :S I am worried! I will promise to get to see a doctor on monday about this I think, as I am worried about my health a lot now! and not sur eif there are too many ways to erradicate this happening to me, could have even been heart faliour, an autopsy? I think it is will be done on monday I think or around then, when they open :s so maybe another cause will be found. But Just my Dads mother died of a heat attack i think, she called a familly relation rather than a doctor saying she had chest pains by the time the familly member got there she was pronounced dead  So I really would like to get quite a few things checked I think... It is reason to be concerned, my mother is now diabetic also! I am seriously in the crap I guess. I don't eat much in the way of fatty foods, just a little inactive at the moment though, I am actually underweight slightly, and have slightly lowered blood pressure so not sure what the risk level is but guess it is as high as anyone else! Still I think I will try to keep calm and not worry about it too much, guess what happens happens, but just doesn't sound nice!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Josh,  Family history of coronary disease means a first degree relative that had a heart attack before the age coronary disease is expected which is 50 in males and 60 in females. So, if your father or brother had heart attacks before the age of 50 or your mother or sister had heart attacks before the age of 60, this is positive family history of coronary disease. So, you don't have family history of coronary disease.  Your chest pain is atypical, i would suggest that you get an x-ray of the neck to rule out cervical spine problems as your symptoms (pain in the shoulders) might be caused by such a problem.  i would recommend that you get an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to exclude mitral valve prolapse, a very common condition that is a very well known cause of chest pain in the young.

I can't really get my doctor here on the NHS to do an echocardiogram he seems to not want to it.. says there is no need! I will try to see him tomorrow and perhaps ask him about it. The pains today have been in my chest leftish side and were like a pulsing pain. and also in my arms like down the bottom of my arms, and on my right arm also at the top under my arm (armpit area) at times... But the thing I can't explain was like last night I had very little sleep but I get like a swelling feeling ro some strange feeling in my chest and then it goes away makes me beathe in like a panic thing but it does worry me a little.. could it be heart faliour or something... :s  !! I do worry a lot about these things, I have been told I have fibromyalgia. But not sure if this could be the ause of all my problems? Also when I get up and do things.. my heart beat is VERY strong and quick, and slow... like not fast heart beats but fairly slow STRONG heartbeats... Still I think I will try my best to get a 24 hour monitoring and an echocardiogram, then if they are clear... then? I guess all is ok? Not a narrowing anywhere my blood pressure I think is still lowish but might get that checked also, guess if there were some blockage somewhere then blood pressure would be higher? Not sure what I can do about my blood pressure to bring it back up again get it to where it should be?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Josh,  Thank you very much for the update.  The pain that you are describing is absolutely atypical for pain of heart origin.  There is nothing called low blood pressure in a healthy active asymptomatic individual. If you are active doing all the things that you are supposed to be doing, you have an adequate blood pressure and there is nothing you should do to try and bring your blood pressure higher where it belongs because where it is now is where it belongs.  Regarding your heart beating stronger, slower than you think it should, i don't think you have to worry about that because you have to run fast to have your heart rate go real high. Stop noticing your heart rate.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

It is in various places in my chest ranging from rib cage, right side, but mostly in my left side.  I have been taking Nexium now for 4 days, and have taken antacid pills like candy, and its still going on.  Does this sound typical of Acid Reflux or should I seek medical advice again?  I saw a doctor about 4 months ago and had EKG, Chest Xray and another heart test where they monitor the patterns of your heart (maybe ultrasound).

With such high blood pressure, these might be warning symptoms that this is a high blood pressure and it needs to be better controlled.   i think you have to call your doctor and tell him about this high blood pressure, even though you are taking toprol which should take care of high blood pressure but it looks like you have to be kept on higher doses.  Back and chest pains in the presence of high blood pressure can also be caused by aortic dissection, but the pain is usually severe and excruciating and follows the line of dissection which does not sound like it in your case.

Ive been having wierd flashes for the past 4 years or so which the neurologist im seeing says is caused by epilepsy, although CAT, EEG, and MRI have showed nothing wrong. Im planning on starting the medicine he's recommended as soon as possible. But Ive been having rather sharp, constant pain in my right side, above the breat, for about 3 weeks now. Sometimes the pain goes through to my right shoulderblade and down my right arm. Always above the breast though. So im hoping it doesnt involve any organs hehe. The night the pain started I also discovered some kind of sore inside my left nostril. And the lymph node on the left side of my neck became swollen. All this happened within a few hours. Ive been to 2 doctors, the 2nd doctor prescribed penicilin and after about 3 days the swelling of the node disappeared. The sore in my nose is the same as the day it appeared. Very painful as well. The penicilin is finished after 10 days of 3 times a day. Ive read several posts by others on this website with similar pain. But saw nothing about the symptoms of infection also. Im curious whether it might have something to do with my neurological problem.. Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated. TY\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Right side chest pain/infection?",
    "content": "Dear ty,  If the pain increases with taking a deep breath, it could be related to infection. There is a membrane around the lungs called the pleura and if it gets inflammed due to many causes including infection it can cause pain.   The sore in your left nostril most probably has something to do with the lymph node on the left side of the neck. i hope that the sore has disappeared by now. Taking antibiotics can sometimes help the problem if the sore was caused by infection or if it was secondary infected, meaning that it was caused by something else but since the skin in this area is not present anymore to protect this area, it gets infected. And secondary infection can cause the lymph node to enlarge and if the infection is treated, the lymph node goes away. The sore remains because its original cause was not treated.  About the pain in the right side, besides being caused by an infection or an inflammation, it can be caused by cervical spine problems so i would recommend having a neck x-ray to rule out this problem.  If you have not tried anti-inflammatories yet, i would suggest that you do and see whether they make any difference.

    "content": "About 9 months ago I began having a pain in the center of my chest.  It felt more like a sore muscle than anything else that I can describe.  The pain was not constant and only happened once in a while.  At first I thought that maybe I had bruised something internally while playing around with my children, but then after weeks it still continued.  Over the last month or so it has worsened.  The pain spreads to the right side of my chest and is more of a heavy pressure type feeling and a few times has caused a numbing sensation in my chest.  Over the last two days it has gotten more intense.  The left side of my chest has been hurting.  The pain is sharp at times but more of a heavy feeling.  The discomfort does not come with any other symptoms.  There is not a specific time that it happens such as exercise or rest.  My father died of a heart attack at 40 and my mother had her first heart attack in her 30's.  My doctor did an EKG, echocardiogram (think that is what they call it) a year and a half ago and found nothing that he mentioned to me.  Although, I am not sure why he did them.  Sounds silly, huh?  I was not experiencing any discomfort or anything to make him do the test.  He could have done them because of my family history.  I just find it odd that it could be my heart because I am so young and I have no other symptoms.  I have hesitated going to the doctors because I lost my insurance when my husband passed away in August and I am sure that this sort of thing would run up a pretty big bill.  Are there any simple inexpensive test (as in a few hundred dollars) that can be done to determine the problem?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Carol,  Females of the child bearing age are usually protected against coronary disease. You have a major risk factor for coronary disease which is strong positive family history for coronary disease. Your chest pain though sounds atypical as compared to the pain of coronary disease.  It is sometimes difficult to determine the probability of a patient having coronary disease and whether or not the chest pain that he/she has is due to it. In your case, i think because of the strong positive family history and eventhough your chest pain is atypical, i would recommend you having an exercise stress test (preferably with a nuclear scan).  If you don't have medical insurance, if you live in a medium sized town, most probably you will find free clinics around that will be able to help you.   Chest pain can be caused by other diseases besides coronary disease, your chest pain can be caused by neck spine problems, reflux disease (eventhough it sounds odd but reflux can present with chest pain) and others such as inflammation of the cartilages of the ribs and may be problems such as gall bladder disease.  So, you might want to try over the counter medications such as advil and the like and see whether they will help (always take them after you eat) and may be an anti-acid to see if it helps. If any of these medications help, then most probably the chest pain is not due to coronary disease.

My wisdom teeth are growing in on my upper/lower left-side jaw( don't have medical/dental insurance right now) causing swelling of gums and pressure on my teeth. As they were growing in I had foul tasting fluid in my mouth. I attempted to put oragel on the tender area....BAD IDEA...caused a cyst-like swelling along my jawline. It has since subsided, but can still feel it a little bit. This wisdom teeth situation kinda sucks, to say the least. I can only chew on one side of my mouth because the upper wisdom tooth is growing -in outwards toward where the lower gum-line meets the cheek causing toothbite imprints and pain. Any food that sticks to my wisdom tooth feels like it slices into the area.......maaaaaaaan. I've noticed a lump just below my hairline on the back of my neck, left-side. I get headaches mostly on the left-side of my head and feel pressure behind my left eye. - - - when I feel the pain in my chest I have a habit of grabbing my chest in that area and taking a deep inhale, seems to make it subside. (i smoke) - - - I also did some heavy lifting 2 years ago and pulled/picked-up a very heavy object the wrong way and hurt my back. The pain felt like someone took a hand-held bicycle pump and injected air into my lower spine. Extreme pressure and could hardly walk. Currently, I'm o.k. but if I push working too hard I can feel the pain start to come back. - - I'm a workaholic, former bad alcoholic, and just either haven't had the time to go to the doctors or had no insurance(for myself) at the time. -father of four and married ten years, 31 years old  I also have a pains in my throat. right around where the collar bone (in front) meets throat muscles(right along the collar bone) and pain where the muscles on the chest meet the center part of the ribcage. I get a sore/dry throat. It feels like muscle pains. The swallowing muscles. _________________\n\n",

I want to take one right now, because I feel dizzy, just like I did last night right before I took it.    I was trying to stop them completely yesterday.  The weird thing is my blood pressure is low...and my heart rate is normal, so I didn't think going off of them would be a problem.    What should I do?  Also...I have been having this weird tight feeling in my chest since I've been taking it, which was another reason I wanted to stop.  What could that possibly be?\n\n",

Inderal is generally well tolerated although there are side effects experienced by some people. Most of them are quite mild. Some of the rare side effects are fatigue, nausea, lightheadedness, slow heart rate, low blood pressure, numbness, tingling, etc. etc. My suggestion to you is if you are having difficulty talking to your healthcare provider when you call, tell the receptionist (or whom ever answers their telephone calls) that you will wait on hold until you can speak with your doctor. Again I would discourage abrupty stopping this medication before talking to your doctor. Sincerely,  Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Dear srstep,  What kind of heart disease do you have? How was it diagnosed? What are the expected symptoms?  Clinical trials have shown that patients who have an acute coronary syndrome, such as unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and are admitted to the hospital and have a hemglobin of less than 10 gm%, need to be transfused up to a hemoglobin of 10 gm%.  There are some studies that suggest that patients can even tolerate lower hemoglobin level.  This has been an everlasting debate.  Blood transfusion is not without complications and adverse events. Unless absolutely necessary, in my personal opinion, i don't think that a patient should get blood.  A hemoglobin of nearly 9 gm% is not that bad, if you are not having any symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, weakness, easy fatigability, i would suggest that no transfusion is given, but still it is up to you and your doctor to discuss it and decide which is best for you as your doctor knows you definitely better than i do.

    "title": "Heart Palpitations/Weird beats",
    "content": "Hello,  For about the past 8 weeks or so, I have been having what I would describe as heart palpitations.  Basically, what happens is at random times, it feels as though one heart beat is split into two, with there being a very powerful first part of the beat and then the second half of the beat seems to catch up.  It seems to happen at random times, but most often in the morning (especially when I'm in the shower for some reason).  I have been to the doctor...an EKG, ECG and chest x-ray were all done and everything came out normal.  I wore a halter monitor and had two episodes during that time, and I am currently waiting on my doctor for those results and what he saw during those episodes.  The doctor said that occassionally, you can have an \"extra\" heart beat, which can be very powerful because blood has had an opportunity to collect in the heart, and then in order to pump it out, the heart has to have a very powerful pump, and he seems to think based off of the tests and my description, this is what I have.  My problem with this is that he said occassionally.  For the last 8 weeks, I can count on my two hands the number of days I haven't had one of these occurances.  I am 25 years old, I don't smoke or do drugs, and I drink only socially.  I am overweight (though currently on a diet and exercise program which is working!!!) and according to the doctor, my bloodwork showed that my cholesterol is exactly 200, but hopefully with my diet and exercise, that will come down.  I have caffeine very infrequently, although I do suffer from a lot of stress due to my job.  I have only one relative that's had heart-related problems - my grandfather on my father's side has had two mild ones, but he's also a borderline alcoholic.  I do trust the doctor I saw, but I'm not sure if what I have been having can be described as simply as he seemed to.  Is there anything else that can be going on in my heart to describe what's happening here?  Any help or information anyone can provide would be very helpful!  Thanks, michael_r_1668\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Heart palpitations/weird beats",
    "content": "Dear Michael,  Palpitations can be caused by: 1. An overactive thyroid gland. 2. Electrolytes disturbance. 3. Mitral valve prolapse. 4. Smoking. 5. Drinking alcohol. 6. Drinking too much caffeinated beverages. 7. Not getting enough sleep. 8. Stress.  If not already done i would suggest a blood test for thyroid gland and electrolytes.   Have an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart) to rule out the presence of mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse is a farily common condition found in otherwise healthy young adults who usually complain of palpitations and atypical chest pain.  Certain types of palpitations called pvcs (which at one point thought to be a threat) were treated very aggressively (especially if they had certain characteristics) in any patient. After a certain clinical trial was conducted, where asymptomatic healthy young adults wore Holter monitors, it was found that these healthy young adults had pvcs, so it was decided not to treat pvcs (the kind of palpitations that was thought to be a threat) if the patient is asymptomatic and is otherwise healthy.  You can feel the palpitations (so you are kind of symptomatic), i am not sure about what kind of extra beats you have, but i don't think it is going to make a difference because even if they were pvcs, treatment is not recommended) but if you choose to receive treatment, this means that you have to take medications for as long as you are going to feel these palpitations and these medications usually have side effects and of course they are going to be a financial burden.  It is upto you whether or not you want to receive treatment, but i think if you can get by without treatment it would be better.   Some people with these palpitations, even though it might sound a little bit out of line for some, but they learn to live with these palpitations and ignore them.

I have also had bloodwork done, and my physician indicated my thyroid functions came out normal.  All in all, my doctor did seem to find me in good health, which is why the continuation of these palpitations has been a concern for me.  Would these pvcs you refer to continue to occur over a span of several months?  I appreciate the input and understand the idea to live with the palpitations...it just seems to me that with the heart being such an important part of the body and life functions, that something like this would not just be something to be ignored.

    "content": "Dear Doctors Lounge, It started about a year ago while I was in Brazil. I never was a drinker, but sometimes I had a whiskey with coke or one, maximal two beer, until I became pain or stiffness in the neck-like a tension headache. I quit drinking any totally, because it became worse and about 6 months ago, I became this pain already from just drinking once or twice from a beer. (It always came about an hour later). My overall condition changed too and I felt sometimes dizzy etc. I had it checked from a physician in Brazil, 10 months ago and after he received my blood tests, he told me that I had no diabetis, colesterol of 200, but very hy fat in the blood. More I don`t remember. Since a few months, I also became chestpain when ever I had stress situations. The chestpain went away, but since three days, I have it again, worse than ever before and I feel even pain in my left arm with tingeling down to the fingertips. Any laud noise or slidest stress brings it up again and I am very much afraid. Problem is, that I do not have any health insurance right now and no funds,but have applied for one, which will cover me from March on. I am taking Aspirin, because I was told that this would help to prvent a heart attack.....  Can I make it until March this way, or is there anything I can do to prevent worse things to happen until March? Can you give me advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Keith,  Thank you very much for the update.  Dilated cardiomyopathy means that you don't have coronary disease. This was proven by the cardiac catheterization that was performed. And this is done for patients with low ejection fraction to make sure that a bypass surgery is not needed which would be the treatment of choice in cases of coronary disease so that the ejection fraction improves.  The etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy is very difficult to determine and if no cause is found, it is called idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. It is difficult to predict the course of the disease in many patients.  There are now several treatment modalities that have been proven to increase the ejection fraction and decrease mortality.

    "content": "Hello,  I have been worried about the following symptoms.  Last summer I experienced acute dizziness and a sensation that I can only describe as a feeling that I was about to die and  that my whole system was shutting down. It scared me severely as I had never experienced anything lke it before. It recurred intermittently and I went to a neurologist, who ordered a brain MRI. He informed me that nothing showed relating to my brain but that I clearly had sinusitis and polyps in my sinus. I then went to an ENT specialist who said that the sinusitis was not a real problem and not the cause of my dizziness. At the beginning of December 2004, I felt acute shortness of breath climbing one flight of stairs, and then the sensation of collapsing, although I never did faint. I was taken to hospital where I was diagnosed with an abnormal ecg, and then an enlarged heart. I do not have diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol. There is no history of heart disease in my immediate family.   I was monitored overnight, bloodwork was done,  and the cardiac doctor did an echogram and said that the echo looked normal, but that the ecg was abnormal.  I was told that I should come back in February for a stress test and a monitor to be attached. for a day. This was in London. I am now in NY. Since I have been here, I have experienced sensations of gradual paralysis in my throat and chest, shortness of breath such that I find it difficult to have conversations sometimes, of having an obstruction in my chest, as if I  had swallowed something indigestible, weakness in my calves, cramping in my hands and dizziness. I am always belching and swallowing air in an attempt to clear the sensation of choking in my chest and throat,, and my chest aches continuously..  The symptoms appear to be getting worse, or at least occuring more frequently and I am not sure what this could be. I find it hard to focus on anything else between episodes, and I would like an opinion on what this might be and steps I might take.  I hope that this is clear and not too confused  a description, but I find it difficult to describe ths easily.  Keith Anthony\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Keith,  With the symptoms that you are describing, i think these are warning symptoms for a stroke.  Did the mri that you had in England look at the blood vessels of your brain as well, called mra?  If not, i think you should be evaluated by a neurologist on an emergeny basis, and have the circulation of your brain looked at immediately.   Stroke does not necessarily mean that you have a blocked artery but could mean that you have an aneurysm that is about to rupture and this is an emergency situation.  About the abnormal ekg, if the echocardiogram that was done in England was normal, it does not mean that you don't have coronary disease, i think it is a good idea to rule this out by having a stress test, but i think that you being evaluated for these stroke warning symptoms have the priority over anything else.  Please, i urge you to go to the emergency room now if at all possible.  This does not mean that this can be the only cause of your symptoms, but this is the most serious one, so you have to be evaluated and if turns out to be wrong, then well and good and other things could be looked at then.

My EF is said to be somewhere between 30% and 40%. I was told 40 at the stress echo test, and 30 by the doctors who performed a cardiac catheterisation on me.

    "content": "Dear Keith,  Thank you very much for the update.  There are medical treatment options that were proved in clinical trials to improve the ejection fraction of the heart in cases of heart failure. The patient might feel a little worse at the begnining and it takes a while for the ejection fraction to improve. Some patients did not respond however. These same treatment options decreased mortality rate significanly in clinical trials as well.  You are 44 years old and you still have a life to live and as healthy as possible. i suggest that you be followed-up by a cardiologist who is interested in heart failure patients in a place (preferably where heart transplant is done) so that you be treated the best way there is. No need to say that there are some patients who respond better than others and there are patients whose condition worsen faster. What i want to say is for you make sure to be followed in a place, offering all the available treatment options (up to heart transplantation) even if you don't need them either now or in the future.

    "title": "Re: Passing out by coughing",
    "content": "Dear Nick,  For the brain to work (so for one not to lose consciousness), it must receive blood from the heart.  The heart is a pump and in order to pump blood out to the tissues including the brain, it has to receive it back from the body.  There are factors that control the blood coming back from the body. One of them is the pressure inside the chest. If the pressure inside the chest is high, the blood is not able to travel against high pressure and no blood reaches the heart and no blood comes out of the heart.  When you cough, the pressure inside the chest rises quite a lot, and if the cough is continuous, this means that the pressure does not have enough time to go down and it rises to an extent that the flow of blood back to the heart is minimal and so the blood being pumped out of the heart to the tissues is minimal also and so the blood reaching the brain in minimal and this means that the brain would stop functioning and one would lose consciousness.  This is called cough syncope.  There is nothing to worry about at this time.  But you have to have precautions especially when you are driving or operating any kind of machinery. If you are driving, and you start coughing vigorously, i would suggest that you stop the car by the side of the road if you can as soon as you feel that you might lose consciousness, and once you are back to your normal status, you can restart driving.

Since 2000 or so, I had been suffering from odd bouts of extreme dizziness, fainting, and general all around collapsing lifeless on the ground, and have been recently diagnosed with postural hypotension.  I've noticed alot in PE at school, that my energy is sometimes completely drained, and I get dizzy and feel about to pass out after something as simple as a baseball game.  I am assuming that this is because of the postural hypotension, because I am not *that* out of shape, and it only happens sometimes.  What I'd like to know is, how could my hypotension affect regular running and jogging activities?  And, is there anything I should watch out for?  Besides hypotension, I am as healthy as a teenager could possibly be.  I am also nearly six feet tall, if that affects anything.   Soulrio\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Soulrio,  How were you diagnosed with postural hypotension and were you offered any treatment?  Losing consciousness in young age should prompt a battery of tests especially if the loss of consciousness is related to exercise and if the person wishes to start an exercise regimen or plays a certain type of sports.  If not already done, i would suggest that you have a thorough physical examination and an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to rule out any heart causes for the syncope and if it turns out to be normal there is nothing to worry about and you can start your exercise regimen.

Well been back and fowards to doc with panic attacks aniexty since as sometimes my syptoms do not make sense, I have increased heart rate in the morning, when i experience the extra beats they make me feel light headed and i get like a body rush down arms and legs, i can just be sitting and get a stab under left breast is this heart related? Any way i had another child in jan 2004 i was experiencing this beats the whole pregnancy but at checks bp fine i went to the gym 3 times a week when pregnant till the day i had her and i was fine but about 3months after she was born again they got worse doc are taking no notice they say it is panic, I take beta blockers which help with the fast heart rate, Extra beats still there,i feel like internally i can feel like a vibrate or click feeling it is hard to explain sometimes which actually is worse when i do miss meals,  now the stab feeling worries me i don't know if it is my reaction to it but bp goes up to 139/98 when these things happen. What is concerning me is i have been having these strange episode where i go to bed  feel i little like i can't take a full breath i fall aslepp than after a while i have dived up standing in the middle of the room and trying to catch my breathe when i do heart is beating like mad about 180 i start to relax heart slows and it passes when i take bp at this time it was 157/80 then 10mins later bacj to 121/77, Is this a heart this or am i holding my breath or something? I am 23 years 5f4 49kg do not smoke or drink alcohol. I have done loads of research and i think mine is soomething to do with my mitral valve.I take 30 mg of propannanol and 20mg cipramil a day. When they tried me on escitaprimil new version i had horrific extra beats and went to a&e. I just feel like i will drop down dead and know one will know if i am alone and i will leave kids . Why have my pvcs started was it pregnancy? Do you reackonise any of my sympoms? would my tests have change much would echo have picked something up? What about bp? Is there any heart thing that relates to me i have read every thing and done loads of research any help would be great! WORRIED! Oh forgot to mention when i was about 6 i used to feel like i could not breathe catch my breath and would collapse and had tests in hospital  then but nothing found i was given nifedipine for these eposides but  only happening for year or so.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Confused and scared",
    "content": "Dear Healthy100,  Did your cardiologist ever tell you that you have mitral valve prolapse? What were the results of the echo that you had in 2001?  When the echo was invented, they found out about this condition known as mitral valve proplase. It is so common. They found that it affected the otherwise healthy young adults mostly females. When they looked back at the symptoms most of these patients suffered from, they were palpitations and atpycial chest pain (like the stab that you get under your left breast).  Like your cardiologist said there is absolutely nothing whatsoever to worry about.  If you are worried that what you are suffering from a serious condition and it is heart related. Let me tell you that pregnancy and labour are the greatest stressors of the heart and circulation and if your heart could take the stress of pregnancy and labor, then, without a doubt, you have a very healthy heart and you need not to worry even one bit.  About the palpitations and the pvcs, they are most probably caused by mitral valve prolapse if this is what your doctor meant about having a sticky valve. If the propranolol is helping with the symptoms, i would advise you to continue taking it.  In the past, pvcs were treated very aggressively even in young patients. But there was a study conducted on a very large number of vry active healthy young adults who were not even complaining of anything. They wore the 24 hours heart monitors and many of them had pvcs and they were unaware and everything else was normal, so it was decided not to treat pvcs as aggressive as before in the active healthy young adults (like yourself) unless they are symptomatic like you, so a medication like inderal is given to them.  Most probably, you had these tests done before, but if they were not, i would urge you to have a blood thyroid function test and an electrolyte blood test.  In addition to not smoking and drinking alcohol, i would urge you to stop drinking any caffeinated beverages if you are and have enough sleep. Sometimes, these simple measures help patients overcome their symptoms.  The event that you describe is most probably a panic attack and i think that in addition to the medication that you are getting for depression, that you might need a very small dose tranquilizer that you might use at bed time on as needed basis to help you calm down before you go to sleep and see if this helps.

    "content": "Dear Healthy100,   If you are worried that the stab pains are due to coronary disease, to determine whether or not certain chest pain is due to coronary disease, the risk factors for coronary disease that the patient suffering from chest pain has are looked at in addition to the characteristics of the pain that the patient is suffering from in comparison to that of coronary disease. If the patient does not have any risk factors for coronary disease and the characteristics of the pain are atypical then the probability that this pain is due to coronary disease is very small to virtually non-existent. If the patient has coronary risk factors and the pain is typical, patient most probably has coronary disease and evaluation by coronary angiography is done. If it is in the middle then the patient gets a stress test.  In your case, females of the child bearing age are naturally protected against coronary disease. You don't have any coronary risk factor and your pain is atypical. So, this is not coronary disease. The chest pain that you have sounds like the ones descibed by many patients who mitral valve prolapse.  i could not understand whether or not you have mitral valve prolapse from the way you quoted your doctor but i think it looks as if he is saying you have mitral valve prolapse.  The strain of pregnancy does not have anything to do with this condition.   As for the dive up feeling and gasping then racing heart when asleep, the event that you describe is most probably a panic attack and i think that in addition to the medication that you are getting for depression, that you might need a very small dose tranquilizer that you might use at bed time on as needed basis to help you calm down before you go to sleep and see if this helps.   Please, stop checking your pulse in the morning and then you will not have to worry about how fast or slow it is.  i don't think that if your doctor thought that this is a serious condition that he would send you to have behavioral therapy. All you have to do is not to check your pulse. If you are still confused about the mitral valve prolapse, either call your cardiologist and ask about the diagnosis frankly or have another echocardiogram done and this time ask directly about mitral valve prolapse.  The chance of cardiac arrest with pvcs in a healthy heart are very small. Cardiac arrest caused by arrhythmias is termed sudden cardiac death. Please refer to the american heart association website where their scientific position on sudden cardiac death is explained in a very clear and simple way.

    "title": "Question on heart, respiration rate, PVCs and MVP",
    "content": "Hi; I think I am very healthy (female age 39, normal weiight/slim) and I am just checking on a few things.  I have read about normal heart rate and respiration rate and my question is:  Are my lower rates fine?  (I do not go out of my way to exercise but I am never tired and have plenty of energy.)  I checked these rates while resting in bed and again at my computer in the morning after having coffee.  Here is what I got:  In bed:  Respiration: only 8 or 9 breaths per minute              Heart rate:  47-53 bpm in different trials  At computer:  Respiration:  10-11 bpm                        Heart rate:  65  I hope this indicates only being in \"good shape\" and not a problem.   I do have to say that I was also having what I think are PVCs in the evening while lying in bed.  I believe they happen more when resting after moving around than while moving around.  I went to a cardiologist five years ago due to losing my balance (feeling like the room went sideways brieflly) and he told me only that my blood pressure tends to run low (110/70 or 110/60 and sometimes lower) and that I should drink more fluids (less Cuban coffee, though) and eat more salt.  Of course, when he hooked me for an EKG, the PVC-like feeling happened not once while I was there (how frustrating for the patient! ;o)  The reason I am labeling  these  PVCs is because I get a vigorous fluttering feeling in my throat/high chest area and this corresponds to a \"missed beat\" when taking a pulse. This does not worry me, but it is unpleasant because it feels unusual, as if a bird or small creature is fluttering just above the collarbone..   I understand these are not very harmful, still, I try to control them by remembering to drink more.  I admit I am not a naturally thirsty person and sometimes go all day realizing that I've only had two cups of coffee.  I know that everyone blames coffee but if I am able to keep these from happening via diet/hydration//adequate rest, I assume it's OK to have my coffee in moderation, too?? (just two good-sized cups is all I ask for.)  Would my nice low blood pressure and heart rate explain why I am colder and less thirsty than most people?  I have had thyroid  tested and it is ideal (not just OK) and I have no signs of low thyroid except that my extremities cool down (not in summer)  pretty fast unless I am really moving a lot.  (I am tall, also.)   I warm up well enough if walking around doing stuff but just sitting, I get pretty cold unless it's 65-70 degrees+ and I take a lot of hot baths in the winter just to get warm for a while.  Last question:  fifteen years ago I was given an echocardiogram that took quite a while  (at least an hour) and the result was a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate MVP with some other details given (I've forgotten them by now.)  It was nothing bad, though, and I was told to take prophylactic antibiotics for situations like childbirth or dental work.  Now I have read that MVP is so common that it is perhaps a variation of \"normal.\"  At any rate, though, seven years ago while pregnant I was given another ECG done by what appeared to be a 18 year old technician and it lasted only 15-20 minutes.  The report indicated no MVP.  My obstetrician decided to be cautions and treat me as if I do have MVP, and recommended that I continue with prophylactic antibiotic treatment since heart valve infection is not something anyone wants to tangle with.  I am going to continue as if I have MVP, although sometimes I wonder if I reallly need to take amoxicilllen every time I need a teeth cleaning.  My question is:  Is MVP something that does not present itself continuously, so that a 20-minute scan might have missed it?  They told me that \"15 years ago, machinery was not as sensitive as it is today,\" and I consider that to be beside the point, as 15 years ago was not in the dark ages, and I saw a very detailed report then.  Thanks!  Final point if you can corroborate it:  While pregnant the last time (I have four children) I had a syndrome each morning wherein I sat at the table reading or eating and my heart rate got very fast and I felt so exhausted that I had to go lie down.  (I am not the type to check heart rate but after so many eposides of this I just had to wonder what was causing the overwhelming fatigue.  My BP in each pregnancy stayed at the same rate I mentioned above, never becoming high.)    A doctor I saw at the time (not an OB but just a psychiatrist - hmm...) insisted that it was due to anxiety (!) (I know all about anxiety and I know when I am having it and when I am NOT having it) but I read that it is common while hugely pregnant for blood to have a hard time getting back up past the uterus while sitting.  Sure enough,  positions other than sitting with legs bent alleviated this problem.  (standing, for example, presented no problem.)   It woulld be nice for a doctor to say, \"Yes, that symptom was related to pregnancy and blood flow.\"  I am never anxious in the A.M while reading the paper/eating breakfast but I noticed that the need to lie down would increase with each minute of sitting up and the fatigue didn't lessen until resting for at least 1/2 hour.  This didn't persist much later in the day and I read that it is a morning circulatory problem.  Other than that I had no lack of energy or other discomforts while pregnant, not even a backache, and had large (8-10 lb.) healthy babies.   Comments are welcome.  Thanks in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Meredith,  You don't have to worry about your respiratory rate or your heart rate (in any situation) if you don't have any symptoms. This means that they are adequate.  Regarding mitral valve prolapse, actually, it has been postulated that some cases of mitral valve prolapse are temporary and could be due to dehydration.  You have to remember that sometimes it is easy even for experienced operators to miss very mild mitral valve prolapse because sometimes it does not occur with every heart beat or the view of the heart is not the best and some people choose not to comment on it if they are not sure.  In cases of mitral valve prolapse, only associated with mitral valve regurge that the patient has to take antibiotics for prophylaxis against valve infection. If the patient does not have mitral valve regurge, it is not recommended to take antibiotics. And for cleaning your teeth, even if you had mitral valve regurge it is not recommended to take antibiotics either. Patients take antibiotics when they are going to have a dental procedure that will cause bacteria to enter the blood as in cases of dental extraction where there is kind of a wound and since the mouth is full of bacteria, some of them will enter through this access and if there is enough of them might cause infection of the mitral valve.  Regarding your extremities getting cold fast, some people have an exaggerated reflex of getting blood vessel constriction when you are exposed to cold weather, blood moves slowly in the peripheries in the cold weather because of the constriction of the blood vessels normally but some people have this constriction exaggerated. All you have to do is wear wool socks and gloves or mittens and make sure that you are warm when you go out in cold weather, if this is really bothering you, you can talk to your doctor about taking a medication on an as needed basis called nifedipine (it is a blood pressure medication that causes dilatation of the blood vessels).  Regarding your pvcs and the coffee, if you feel that the 2 good sized cups that you get do increase your pvcs significantly, try and drink the least amount at which your symptoms are not exaggerated, if your symptoms are ok, then there is no reason why you should not enjoy your coffee.  i can not comment on what happened to you when you were pregnant and i can not say whether or not it was a circulation problem, an anxitey problem or anything else. If you are not planning on getting pregnant once more, i suggest that you don't give it much thought.  Regarding you not feeling comfortable if the patient is above a certain level, there is no need to worry about that if your thyroid functions are normal. Some people prefer higher temperatures and there is nothing wrong with that.  About thirst, this is controlled by centers in the brain which monitor the level of your sodium, some hormones and other things and if they think any of these need to be adjusted, they adjust it by telling you either to drink more water, less water, urinate, eat salty foods, etc... If your kidney functions and your electrolytes are ok, there is no need to worry whatsoever.

    "content": "Dear niv,  Shortness of breath on exertion has lots of reasons begining with being out of shape and ending with heart failure and lung problems.  Being overweight and without history of doing regular excercise puts being physically unfit at the top of my list.  Together with being a smoker does not really help your lungs.  i suggest that you visit your doctor for an exam, may be have your lung functions evaluated and if your doctor thinks that this is heart related (even though i don't think it is), may be an echocardiogram would be a good thing to do.  However, with the other symptoms that you mentioned (being tired all day long, need to sleep and having swelling in your legs), together with being obese, makes me think that you need to be evaluated for sleep apnea, a disease that affects quite a percentage of the obese population, in which the patient stops breathing during the night causing disturbance in the patient's sleep (that the patient doesn't feel) and the oxygen falls down in the patient's blood as a result of stopping breathing. However, as the patient stops breathing and level of oxygen falls down, the brain of the patients feels it and wakes the patient up so that breathing is resumed. This also, can be a cause of your shortness of breath.  i suggest that you be evaluated by having a formal sleep study.

    "content": "Dear niv,  i forgot to comment on the numbness that you get, this is most probably related to the migraines that you get.  Regarding the chest pressure that you get, females of the child bearing age are naturally protected against coronary disease, you have a major risk factor for coronary disease which is smoking, you don't have any other risk factor for coronary disease such as hypertension or diabetes or high cholesterol and you don't have any family history. But you have not mentioned some of the characteristics of the chest pressure that you get, like where does it come, does it always come with exercise, how long does it last, does it go away if you stop walking, do you continue walking with the chest pressure, does it go anywhere else besides the chest? The answers to these question will decide whether or not, the pain is typical for that of coronary disease. i think that most probably with you walking 5-6 km is indicative that there is nothing wrong.   Like i said before, you have to be evaluated by your doctor, and i would advise to mention this pressure to him/her as well.

    "title": "Re: Sudden increase in blood presure",
    "content": "Dear Jared,  Blood pressure does not always stay the same, it differs from time to time and from situation to situation and from lying down to standing up.  Even though your blood pressure increases from 120/60 to 140/80, it is still within the normal range of blood pressure. High blood pressure is diagnosed when the blood pressure is found to be greater than 140/90 on three different occasions during the same week (meaning on three different days).  It is normal to have an increase in the pulse when you start moving because when you rest your heart does not have to do as much work.   In some cases, people who are dehydrated get an increase in their pulse and a decrease in their blood pressure when they stand up.  If you had diarrhea or vomiting or nausea and were not drinking or eating enough, this might be a cause.  i suggest that you monitor your blood pressure for the time being to make sure it does not go off limits and if it does on three different occasions, then call your doctor to have an appointment.

    "content": "Hello, 30yrold male. Healthy 5'9, 150. White coat hyepertension. At home BP < or = 120/80 (usually 80bpm @ rest). I am an anxious person. In the past I had fluttering symptoms. Cut the caffeine and they went away. I then noticed what ended up being PVC's (8-12 in 24hrs.) diagnosed through a holter monitor. Echo as part of follow-up 2 years ago (2002) was normal. I have learned to live with the rare PVC's. More recently, I developed a vibration deep in my chest on the left side beneath my rib cage that would come and go that was without any other symptoms. 48 hour holter was normal (except for occasional s-tach and PVC's), but of course I didn't have the flutter during the entire 48 hours. Anyway, I was put on Toprol 25mg. Took it two times, but didn't like the lowered heart rate (55-60bpm). Stopped the med. 3 days later had an uncomfrotable feeling in body (brief flu-like symptoms and rising feeling in chest and neck). Then heart started pounding very fast. Went to ER and EKG revealed S-tach at around 135bpm. No PVC, nothing else. Chest x-ray normal. No fever. Potassium a little low (3.0). Very anxious. IV toprol brought heart rate down and discharged with Dx of tachycardia.  I am religiously taking the Toprol now, and while I am still very anxious that this will happen again, my bpm has stayed <80.   1. My question is what happened to me? Panic attack or something more serious? I've been panicky before, but the heart never beat like that! 3. I heard of rebound tach, but after only two doses of Toprol? 3. Doc says no need to repeat echo since it was done two years ago, but coud there be something like a leaky valve that caused this?  5. Am I missing something here?   Thank you so much for allowing my post. Jon\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jon,  pvcs were a big concern at one point with the urgent need for treatment, but after a certain study was conducted and it was found that many healthy very active young people have them with no significant clinical effects, it is seldomely rare to treat them if they are so infrequent and with no effects as in your case.  An echocardigram is usually done to make sure that the young otherwise healthy patient who has palpitations does not have mitral valve prolapse, a condition associated with palpitations and atypical chest pain.  To answer your question, a potassium of 3 will have this effect on your heart. It will cause palpitations secondary to a faster normal heart beat (otherwise known as sinus tachycardia) or can cause arrhythmias. And the question here becomes, why did you have a potassium of 3? Did you have any vomiting, diarrhea, too much urination? How about you appetite, wheren't you eating enough the week or so before this episode? Any medication or herbal supplements that can cause a low potassium? What was your blood pressure during this episode?  There are certain diseases that can cause low potassium and high blood pressure in addition to palpitations. They are quite rare, but if your blood pressure was high when your potassium was low, i would suggest that you discuss this with your doctor and see what he/she thinks.  Currently, i see nothing to worry about. And before you stop any prescription drug in the future, please, it is very important to consult with your doctor first even though you only took  2 doses.  If you are still concerned about this episode, i think to repeat the echocardiogram is not that bad of an idea (but like your doctor said most probably is not going to add much).  Have you ever tried a small dose tranquilizer to see if it will help?  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

I tend to drink 2-3 liters during the work day between 8-5 (and more b4 and after work), and it has been postulated that that is why my potassium was low. It's a tough balance between enough water to prevent stones, but not to drink too much... My BP was in the 140-150s over 80-90 in the ER, but dropped down to my normal of 120/80ish when I got home from the hospital, which follows my typical anxiety of Doctors pattern.   I do have clonazepam that I use prn, but I use it very sparingly in small doses. It helps, but can cause drowsiness.    I may go ahead with the repeat echo just as you hinted, for peace of mind.

If you want to increase your potassium intake, there are 2 ways, either you can take potassium as a medication or as natural supplements. There are fruits that contain a high potassium content such as citrus fruits (oranges and lime) and bananas.  Please, check your potassium level in a week's time to make sure that it is not low again.  i think that most probably in the future you are not going to be needing the toprol if your heart rate remains ok as long as your potassium is within normal range.

    "content": "Dear Firemom,  To decide what is the origin of chest pain suspected to be due to coronary disease, risk factors for coronary disease of the patient suffering from the chest pain and the characteristics of the pain are looked at. If the probability of this being of coronary origin is low, another diagnosis is looked at, if the probability is high, the patient is directly taken to coronary angio and if the probability is in between then a stress test is in order.  Being a female below 50 years generally means that you are protected from coronary disease. You are a smoker, you don't have diabetes or hypertension. You mentioned that your dad has cad but you never said when he developed it. i assume that you don't have high cholesterol or it was not checked.  Pain of coronary disease can occur the way you describe it but it does not have to wait till you wake up and then hits you, usually it wakes you up from sleep. The pain of coronary disease does not go away usually if a person has dry heaves.  So, you have one risk factor and your pain sounds atypical. So, most probably, this pain is not secondary to coronary disease. You mentioned in one of your previous posts that you have a history of ulcers, this could be behind the chest pain. Hiatal hernia can be another cause. You can try anti-acids and see whether or not the pain will improve.  3 years is long time to suffer from chest pain that you thought at one point could be from coronary disease. If you were never evaluated for this chest pain before, i would strongly urge you to be evaluated for it.

I quit smoking on the 14th of this month(both my husband and I joined the smoking cessation class and that was our day that we picked) Anyway, I  Have had countless EKG's,2 chest x-rays, bloodwork ( I was told that all my cholesterol levels were good) a stress test and a 24 hour holter monitor ( I don't get those results till Next Friday though) All other tests came back fine. Now with all these tests run is it safe for me to assume that my heart is fine and this is anxiety? Can anxiety REALLY  cause this chest pressure and sometimes the stabbing pains that I feel? Thanks for helping...\n\n",

    "content": "Dear one_blueangelz,  Being a female of the child bearing age is a natural protection against coronary disease, however, you are a smoker, and this is a major risk factor for coronary disease. You don't have any other risk factors for coronary disease like high blood pressure or diabetes.  Your chest pain does not sound typical as compared to that of coronary disease.   So, even though you are a smoker, yet you are naturally protected (so these 2 cancel each other out) and the chest pain is not typical, so the likelihood of this being coronary disease is very small.  Obviously, I cannot rule out something as dangerous as a cardiac cause for your chest pain over the internet, but according to your description this chest pain is probably not secondary to coronary disease.  Having tachycardia can give you this sensation of chest discomfort and sometimes pain especially if you have it for a long time.  The shortness of breath can be caused by the tachycardia and can cause chest discomfort as well.  When it comes to palpitations, there are some measures that can help greatly, having enough sleep, stop smoking (which you already in the process of doing), stop drinking alcohol and any caffeinated beverages. These measures help a lot of people get rid of their palpitations, believe it or not, as simple as they are. So, i would suggest that you try your best.  What you described in your last post, about your heart stopping, is actually the typical description of an early heart beat (otherwise known as an extra-beat) and there is absolutely nothing to worry about.   Could be this be panic attacks? Sure, but personally i don't like to blame panic attacks till i am sure that there is nothing wrong physically first. So, in addition to the stress test and if not already done, i would like you to have a thyroid function test, a blood test for electrolytes and an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart) if your doctor thinks they are indicated.   Sometimes, there are certain illnesses that come in attacks that mimic panic attacks and are associated with tachycardia, chest discomfort and high blood pressure, this does not sound the case here, but if all tests are negative and you are diagnosed with panic attacks that are not controlled with professional psychiatric help, then i would suggest that this is looked into. These diseases are very rare, so they are not looked at first.  Please, keep me posted about the results of the stress test and your Holter monitor.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Abby,  Being a female of the child bearing age protects you from coronary disease, however, you had a major risk factor for coronary disease, cigarette smoking. It is true that you quit but you never said how long ago. The effects of cigarette smoking on the cardiovascular system remain for quite a while up to years till every thing gets back to normal. You don't have any other risk factors for coronary disease such hypertension or diabetes. You never mentioned anything about cholesterol level.  Also, you did not mention when does the chest pain come, how long does it last, what makes it go away, any other symptoms besides the numbness? Does it come when you exercise? Does it come when you are doing nothing? Does it go anywhere else besides your chest?  Even though you have one major risk factor for coronary disease, but you also are naturally protected so, these two take each other out. i think the characteristics of your chest pain, even though i don't have enough, are not typical as compared to those of chest pain originating from coronary disease. So, the conclusion is most probably this chest tightness is not due to coronary disease.   i think with the history of numbness in your fingers and hands and the recent history of back and leg pain in addition to you gaining some weight, that this chest tightness and numbness in your fingers and hand are secondary to neck problems.  i think you should call your doctor to see what can be done for this problem as it sounds that you have it in both your neck and lower back. i think you should not wait till it gets much worse.

Have you ever had a neck x-ray or ct scan to rule out arthritis?  Your chest pain sounds atypical and you don't have any risk factors for coronary disease. i don't know how long you were able to stay on the treadmill but i assume since you said that everything went perfect that you reached the target heart rate that you should and since you exercise on regular basis i assume that you at least went into stage 3 on the treadmill. If my assumption is right, and the probability of this pain being of coronary origin to begin with was very small, then most probably, the test was a false positive.

The pain can be described as an almost throbing sharp pain located exclusively in that area.  This pain has lasted about 2 weeks now and has occurred mostly 24/7.  I wake up in the morning and I feel fine, but soon after, the pain comes to me and follows me around all day.    Since I also feel back pain, I am wondering if I just have a back problem or if I actually have something wrong with my heart.  As of late, I have also found myself with an inability to concentrate (just thought I should say that in case it's related).  This pain isn't increased while doing physical activities but does stay there all day (even when sitting down and lying down relaxing).  Should I seek help from a local doctor or just take a tylonell and stop worrying?  Can you help me? Sincerely, pat\n\n",

    "title": "24/7 chest discomfort",
    "content": "Background... I'm a 29 year old male, non-smoker, social drinker.  I had been running regularly on a treadmill for 15-20 minutes/day 3-4 times a week prior to symptoms.  I've never used medication or other drugs.  My father died of lymphoma in his early 50's, his younger twin brothers are now in their 50's and both have heart blockage problems (one having recent bypass surgery)... no other close family history of heart problems.  In May 2004, I went running outside for the first time that year, and finished with a sprint.  Upon completion I felt as though I had over-exerted myself, and felt left shoulder pain and a band of strong tightness across my chest.  Being stubborn and not a fan of hospitals, I decided to wait to see if my symptoms got worse, rather than seek medical attention.  Fortunately they did not get worse.  (I reasoned that I was too young to have any serious problems).  The shoulder pain and band of tighness subsided after 1-2 days; however, I still had a less severe central tightness/discomfort in my chest and malaise.  I again decided I would just leave it in the hopes it would disipate.  After 6 months of this discomfort on an ongoing 24 hours a day 7 days a week basis, I decided to get it checked out.  The doctor I saw took chest x-Rays and sent me for a stress test...  both of which came back without problems.  My blood pressure was high during the initial check, but normal at the time of  the stress test a week later.   No other tests were conducted, and the doctor said it was likely acid reflux/heartburn.  (I have never had problems with these, and eating/lack of food do not effect the ongoing sensation of tightness.  I also find it difficult to believe this could be the problem considering the onset occurred immediately after the outdoor run in May).  It has now been 8 months, and there has been no real change in the symptoms; every morning I wake up feeling this discomfort and it remains through the day.  Some days the discomfort is more irritating/more pronounced than other days.  (I've recently helped in a move of heavy furniture which may/may not be responsible for my most recent perceived increase in discomfort)  Other than this discomfort and the occasional malaise/anxiety thinking about this discomfort, I have no other symptoms (ie, no loss of appetite, no fatigue, no shortness of breath... etc.)    I have  jogged on the treadmill sporadically; however, am concerned about making things worse.   I have just started taking Ibuprofen under the assumption that perhaps I have some form of chest inflamation.  Any suggestions on what the problem may be, or other actions I should take would be greatly appreciated.  As well, should I actually be taking Ibuprofen, and if so for how long/ in what dose.   Is it possible this is a form of Dressler's syndrome?  I have not been able to find any other information that could explain the symptoms.  Thank you, J\n\n",

First of all, you don't have any risk factors for coronary disease, second your chest pain is the most atypical and you had a stress test while having this discomfort and the test was normal.  i don't think that this is an emergency, you can talk to your primary care provider about it during your next visit or schedule an early appointment.  Besides coronary disease, chest pain has lots of other cardiac and non-cardiac causes.   This does not sound like reflux to me but i can not really tell you what is this pain except that it might be related to muscles. If inflammation is suspected, there are two blood tests that could be done, they are non-specific but helpful. If they are high, this means that there is some sort of inflammation going on but it does not tell where or what is the cause. These are the c-reactive protein and the erythocyte sedimentation rate.  i think you can take ibuprofen if it helps the pain but you have to be aware of its potential side effects including stomach ulcers and kidney failure if used for prolonged periods of time and if taken on an empty stomach. And even though it does not sound like reflux to me or you, sometimes reflux comes in very atypical ways, so i think it is not such a bad idea if you try an over the counter antiacid.

    "content": "About four days ago my chest started hurting in the afternoon (on the left side where the heart is), and after cramping for a few minutes it stopped hurting. I didn't think anything was wrong at the time, until it started hurting again that night, except then I was also getting cramps in the right side of my chest, seemingly at random (it would hurt for a few minutes on the left, then stop for about 15 minutes, then hurt on the right side for a few). I was also feeling general upper chest tightness. The next morning when I woke my chest started hurting periodically, and throughout the day I was getting cramps in various abdominal spots such as the chest, stomach, and kidneys. That night the pain was becoming quite severe in the heart area so I went to the hospital to be sure it wasnt anything serious, despite my age (17). At the hospital once I told them I hadn't done any athletic activity to aggravate it, they did an EKG, Blood tests and a chest x-ray. All of the tests came back perfectly normal and the doctor didnt know what the problem was, but he suspected it was inflamed muscles in the chest, or that I was coming down with an illness such as pneumonia, and perscribed me Naproxen to deal with the inflammation, if there is any. My mind was at rest until yesterday, when I started getting more pulsating cramps at complete random parts of my body (a fingertip, the bottom of the feet, the wrist). Also, I started getting this pain in the back of my neck. Today the pain is very similar to yesterday, and I have been having more random cramps. I have no idea what the problem is, but I suspect it could be rheumatoid arthritis, because my mom has it, but I'm not an expert. I was wondering if anyone has had similar symptoms or knows what the cause is, and how serious the condition is. Any help is greatly appriciated, and thank you for your time.\n\n",

However this does not explain the palpitations that you get. The chest tightness that you have is most probably nothing serious and the heart pounding that one feels at the end of exercise might be a normal phenomenon.  If your doctor thinks that these tests are not necessary, then there is no need to do them.

    "content": "I posted here a few months ago about having PSVT.  I've been regulated without any problems since the end of May.  I was on Lopressor and Cardizem CD.  My Cardiologist took me off the Lopressor about a month ago.  I have not had PSVT since May - even after stopping the Lopressor.  When I was in the hospital over 6 months ago, they did an echocardiogram, x-ray, several EKGs, blood work, and constant monitoring.  I was told then that my heart was as healthy as it should look for a 26 year old female.  I had a follow-up a month ago.  He did an EKG.  Everything was fine and he said my heart was healthy.  I have a follow-up in June and we'll do more bloodwork then.  Here's my question:  Sometimes I feel a little weird in the chest area.  It's not really pain.  I don't know if I'm thinking myself into it because it's all I think about these days.  I feel a slight pressure around my heart sometimes.  Also, I feel a slight discomfort between my heart and my left armpit.  I sleep on my left arm, so I don't know if that's related.  Since I have been diligent with following up with my doctors and all the tests look good, should I be concerned about this?  Could it be a Cardizem side effect?  I keep telling myself that if there was a problem that all those tests would've pointed something out to me.  I am constantly told that the heart seems healthy.  I've contacted my doctor so many times, I don't want to bother him again.  When I raise any concerns to him, he doesn't seem concerned and says it's been so far, so good.  How concerned should I be?\n\n",

These symptoms occur throught the day numerous times and have been doing so for approximatley 1 month.  I also have squeezing sensation in my chest about 5-10 times a week.  This symptom is quick and not neccessarily accompanied by the numbness in my legs and feet.  If you review my profile, you will see a history of heart disease.  I also have high cholesterol, but have not been tested in more than a year.  What I'm wondering is if this could be something serious, I'm only 29 years old.  Can PAB or something else occur so soon in life?\n\n",

Your chest pain is atypical and you might have one risk factor for coronary disease (mildly elevated total cholesterol (actually i need to know what is the bad cholesterol).  i am not sure what can be the cause of this chest squeezing sensation.  Atypical chest pain that can be secondary to heart disease in your age group can be caused by:  1. Inflammation of the membrane surounding the heart (and your description of the pain does not fit the characteristics). 2. Mitral valve prolapse.  If you still continue to have the chest pain, an echocardiogram would not be a bad idea.  Regarding the numbness and the heaviness in your legs, i suggest that you be seen by your doctor for a physical to decide whether or not there is a neurological condition that needs to be further evaluated by a neurologist.

    "title": "Re: Symptoms of dizziness, left fingers numbness and waking",
    "content": "Dear Mark,  Why do you think your sleep gets disturbed?   The symptoms that you are suffering from could be related to each other (caused by the same disease process) or not (occur individually but simultaneously.  They could be related to:  Regarding the numbness sensation in your hands 1. Sleeping on either of your hands with compression of the nerves and then once you wake up, the nerves start to be uncompressed, feeling starts to come back and you feel this numbness feeling. 2. Carpal tunnel syndrome in either or both hands. 3. Arthritis in your neck.  Regarding the dizziness when you first wake up and then stand up: When one stands up the blood gets pooled in the lower extremities and the blood pressure becomes lower, the nerves that control the blood vessels make the vessel constric the blood pressure becomes higher and normalized once more. As one ages, the nerves that control the blood vessels become less efficient and especially when you are just awake because those vessels are usually kind of depressed during sleep, so when one stands up, the blood pools to the lower extremities, but it takes the blood vessels a while to compensate for the pooling of blood by consticting the blood vessel and during that period of time, the blood pressure is lower than normal and there is less blood going to the brain and hence the dizziness. The solution to this is not to get up at once when you wake up but rise slowly from the recumbant position, sit on the edge of the bed for 30 seconds or so and then rise slowly. This palpitation could be related to the fact that your heart rate increases in a trial to increase the blood flow to various organs when you stand up. This, if the palpitations occur when you stand up.  Regarding the chest discomfort and the heart pounding, this can occur if your sleep is disturbed and you wake up feeling apprehended. The palpitations can be the cause of the chest discomfort.   If these symptoms were related, and from your description, i believe they are not, they could be caused by low blood flow to the brain and this could be a prelude to a stroke. but this explanation does not explain the heart pounding and the chest discomfort.  Do i think that you need to be seen by a cardiologist for a cardiac work-up? Most probably not, reason being, even though you are a male over 50 with a definite positive family history of coronary disease (which are positive risk factors for coronary disease), yet it looks that you have been leading a healthy life style (with nutrition and exercise and not smoking), you don't have any other diseases that are major risk factors for coronary disease (like dibates and hypertension), but the most important thing is that your chest pain is atypical and you can run for more than an hour without getting any chest pain.  If you are referred to a cardiologist, the first step would be a treadmill stress test, which in your case, most probably will be negative because of your excellent fitness. A stress echocardiogram could be done as well. But, if there is a stong suspicion (which i believe there isn't), then a coronary angiogram is going to be the test of choice.

    "content": "I'm 22 years old, I've noticed that for the last year or so, whenever I spend a lot of time lounging around or sitting a certain way, I begin to have this feeling in my chest (but more towards my back) that makes me feel nauseated and sick.  It feels as if there is \"something\" in there and it just makes me feel sick.  It's really rather difficult to explain...but it only happens sometimes when I lie down..never when I'm active.  Also, I never have any other pain, sweating, coughing, or any other symptoms along those lines.  It's never a constant pain, and goes away after I take a nap, sleep during the night, or get up and start moving around.  I've never been able to figure out what this is, and it's rather difficult to explain to a doctor (as you can see!)  But should I be really concerned?  I had a chest x-ray probably about 5 years ago because I was having some strange breathing problems, but they saw nothing wrong.  I'm hoping I get a job I will be interviewing for so I can have some insurance and visit a doctor to talk about this very soon, but can anyone give me any advice/suggestions as to what this might be?

    "content": "Dear Flop,  i think you should contact your doctor right away to tell him/her about this new event.  These episodes could be due to  1. The episodes of tachycardia that you get (even though you don't feel any palpitations). 2. Other cardiac causes not related to arrhythmias. Syncope can be caused by cardiac depression through neurological mechanisms. 3. Non-cardiac related causes such as epilepsy espcially with your recent history of viral infection.  i suggest that you have  1. An eeg (recording of the electrical waves of the brain) which shows whether or not you have epileptiform activity in your brain, which could explain the syncope. 2. A ct scan of the brain. 3. A tilt table test where the autonomic function of the circulation and the heart are tested and see whether the syncope that you have is secondary to the heart conditions that are not related to arrhythmias. 4. An event monitor would not be unreasonable.  Please, refrain from driving or operating any heavy machinery till the cause is identified and effective treatment is started.

    "content": "About 4 months ago i was attending a football game when i suddenly started experiencing chest pains as if a big weight was sitting on my chest. I believe this was a panic attack, but I saw my doctor a few days later. He ordered a chest x-ray and an EKG, both were normal, my blood pressure was also normal. The pain continued, but not as bad, it feels tight in the center and the left varying with my position. It does not bother me in the morning when i wake up, and it does not bother me when i lay on my stomach. Standing for lengthy periods of time bothers it unless i cross my arms very tightly. I also developed heart palpitations (i believe) with occasional skipped beats that were not present when the EKG was done. I am able to see my heart bulge through my chest and it pounds even with the slightest activity so i went back to my doctor 2 months later.  He told me i have a heart murmur and ordered an echocardiogram.  The echo as well as my previous EKG was reviewed by a cardiologist and my doctor. They were normal and the murmur was innocent. Since then i have experienced the same symptoms and occasionally the bottom of my jaw gets sore.  I had a rhinoplasty and septoplasty 5 months ago and i was wondering if anything could be wrong with my breathing. I also have a poor diet and even though i am thin, i do not exercise very often. Could either of these be the source of the palpitations and tightness, or is it due to cardiac problems.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Guest,  The term broken heart is actually a figure of speech. The heart does not get broken.  To determine whether or not chest pain is due to coronary disease, risk factors for coronary disease and the characteristics of the chest pain are evaluated.   You don't have any risk factors for cornoary disease and the chest discomfort that you get is atypical. Obviously, I cannot rule out something as dangerous as a cardiac cause for your chest pain over the internet, but according to your description this pain is probably not due to coronary disease.  The discomfort that you have been getting is most probably of psychological origin presenting as a somatic symptom, something that is not unheard of.

    "content": "Dear Sissy04,  This sounds to me like tension headaches. Headaches can have serious causes such as severe high blood pressure, intracranial bleeding and brain tumours.  If you have such symptoms as blurring of vision, terrible non-resolving and increasing in severity headaches and sudden vomiting without nausea (which does not sound like it in your case) then i think that there is nothing to worry about. Still, you have loss of weight in your lower extremities which can be a sign of pressure on nerves but in your lower back.  Regrading the diarrhea, irritable bowel presents with episodes of diarrhea alternating with constipation alternating with normal bowel habits. The thirst that you are experiencing could be related to you being dehydrated from the diarrhea. Drink as much fluids as you can.

    "content": "I am a 42 year old male, non smoker, and am relatively active. I have been put on aciphex a month ago for possible reflux. My stomach is upset quite alot but the most bothersome is right side chest pain. It is behind my right breast. It will sometimes radiate to my right shoulder or arm. Somtimes it's a feeling of fullness, sometimes pain, and other times tightening. Sometimes it's worse after eating, sometimes bad when I wake up in morning. Today I had about 4 hours of it, with multiple bowel movements (about 5) I had an ekg 2x in past 6 months both normal. I don't have health insurance so I can't afford some of the gastro tests they want to do. My anxiety is wondering if it could be my heart and the ekg's just missed something. I don't get any shortness of breath, it is on thej right side 99% of the time and a precursor is usually my stomach is upset or cramping. The chest pain can be real intense. I did have a sonogram because they wanted to check my gallbladder, and that came out normal. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks and Happy New Year Dave\n\n",

    "content": "Hi bikerdave, Do these symptoms present themselves especially after eating foods containing a high amount of grease/fat? Gallbladder dysfunction can cause severe right sided chest, shoulder, and arm pain. Attacks usually occur after eating certain foods. If this is so in your case, just because an ultrasound came back normal for your gallbladder doesn't necessarily mean your gallbladder is functioning properly. It means that they probably didn't visualize any gallstones etc. A more definitive test to determine gallbladder function is a HIDA scan. I hope this helps. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

He thinks my chest pain is stress, but doesn't know why my blood pressure is so high.  I went to a regular doctor for follow up, he took me off the meds the hospital put me on and put me verapamil 180mg once daily and protonix antacid with ativan for stress... He sent me for a treadmill stress test which I passed...    We still don't know what is causing my blood pressure to be so high, the verapamil is NOT controlling it...

    "content": "Dear Ellen,  Rarely, wellbutrin is known to cause severe hypertension. How long have you started it and for what reason and how long are you supposed to be taking it?  As for the cause of hypertension, it is divided into two main categories: 1. Primary hypertension: No reason is identified, usually runs in families. 2. Seondary hypertension: There are some diseases that can cause hypertension, most of them are secondary to hormones released in the circulation and these hormones cause the increase in the blood pressure.  i take it that most probably the chest pain is the thing that made you go to the emergency room and then it was discovered that your blood pressure is high. Chest pain in itself can cause high blood pressure from the apprehension and the stress that this (having chest pain) might be something serious like a heart attack.  What do you mean by you passed the stress test? What kind of test did you have? A treadmill test or a chemical test? If a treadmill how many minutes were you able to go on the treadmill? How high did your heart rate go? What was your blood pressure during the test?  To treat hypertension, if it has a secondary cause, this cause should be treated. If it is primary then there are lots of different groups of medications that are used to treat hypertension. It depends on the response of the patient. And there are some patients who require a small dose of one medication and there are patients who require maximum doses of many medications, so what works for you might not work for someone else and so forth.  The verapamil might not be working for you and may be your doctor would like to switch to another medication.  If i may, i would like to suggest to stop the wellbutrin, ask your doctor if he/she thinks that this might be secondary hypertension, if yes, then do the tests that he/she suggests.

    "content": "I am having a problem with my heart beats. It started for me when I was sitting and relaxing and I felt a weird heart beat, I have had these before and they never really seemed to bother me. But this time I felt my pulse and didn't find one. I am sure that it was there but I did not locate it right away and immediately went into a panic. I was convinced I was having some kind of heart attack and my heart just raced. It took me a while to calm down but I eventually did. That night my heart beat at a normal rate but very heavily. This went on for a week or two very difficult to sleep because of such a heavy beat in my chest and hot feeling in my chest. I can also feel a particualr spot just in the area between my chest and my side. I could relieve the feelings by sitting up and slept in my easy chair for the next two weeks. I had an episode about a week later where I got anxious about something and it started my heart racing again but this time it did not go away. I counted my heart rate around 145 for about 30 mins while trying to relax and called a friend who is a doctor. He told me I may want to go to the ER just in case. They hooked me up to do an ECG which turned out normal and did a chect xray (normal) but had to pump about 4 big shots of something to get my heart rate back down. I was told to see a specialist. I had a halter monitor 24 hr and 30 day as well as an echo and both were ok. The doctor put me on  lopressor which made me feel absoultely horrible. After waiting 30 days to get back to see the doctor he put me on nadolol instead. This doesn't help either. I still have this same problem although I have learned to relax and control the tachycardia I cannot seem to get past this heavy heartbeat and same hot sensation in my chest. I also have very mild chast pains at times. This is wrecking my quality of life. My doctor is convinced there is nothing wrong but I cannot get past this. I need help in a desperate way.....what can I do??  Thank you very much for your time as I know this post was long.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Delsoto,  Even though you make it sound like a panic attack, sometimes, panic attacks may be caused by diseases.  There are certain diseases that are known to come in bursts and cause tachycardia, increase in blood pressure and feeling of apprehension. If you have increased blood pressure as well during these episodes then i would suggest that you discuss this possiblity with your doctor. These diseases are rare so most of the doctors think of them last. Examples include a tumour called pheochromocytoma and a disease called carcinoid syndrome.  Personally, before pinning any symptoms or disease process on a psychiatric process, i like to exhaust all possibilites and make sure that there is really nothing organic that is causing this disease.  i would suggest starting by the simplest blood test and that is a thyroid blood test if not already done and if your doctor thinks that there is a possibility that this might not be a psychiatric problem that needs to be addressed through professional help, then i think your should be referred to an endocrinologist.  Now before doing all of this, there are a few things that you should refrain from doing mainly smoking and chewing tobacco, drinking alcohol and caffeinated beverages and you should have enough sleep and get enough rest. Many times, these simple measures, believe it or not, get rid of the problem.   Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "Dear Delsoto,  Thank you very much for the update.  The feeling of strong heart beats can stay for a while after tachycardia i think because when you can feel your heart beating as fast, it is usually (but not all the time) a feeling of weak rapid heart beats but once the rate is slower, the feeling changes to slow(er) and strong(er) heart beats, so this is a relative thing, i think you should not be worried about it and as you learnt to control your feelings and calm down, i think you will be able to learn to ignore this feeling of strong heart beats as well.  Please, discuss the fact that this could be secondary to a disease with your doctor. Being able to calm down could just be the fact that the attack or burst is gone and that's why you think you are able to control the rate.  Stop chewing tobacco, smoking, drinking any amount of alcohol and caffeinated beverages and please get enough sleep.

Did you visit your doctor or had any tests? Are you losing weight? How is your appetite? How are your bowel movements otherwise?  Diarrhea has many causes begining with an exaggerated gastro-colic reflex (colon empties when stomach is distended) and intolerance of some foods such as lactose intolerance and ending with having severe inflammation of the colon.  If this diarrhea has been there for a while, i would suggest that you see your doctor to have at least a stool sample to be sure that there is nothing wrong.  Regarding the throat problem, i can't make a diagnosis without taking a look at your throat, so when you go see your doctor for the diarrhea, ask him to take a look at your throat as well.

    "title": "Ongoing Dizziness & Chest Pains",
    "content": "I'm a 26 y/o male. 6' 175lbs.  No history of smoking, drugs, drinking.  For the past 2.5 months I have had a constant ongoing dizziness/fatigue  that does not differ with exertion and/or positional changes (the only time I feel worse is about 15-20 minutes after eating a full meal, I get dizzier for about 45 minutes).  This has all  been accompnied by occasional heart palpitations a virtually constant aching left-sided chest pain that is sometimes radiating to my left shoulder.  Initial onset of dizziness came on suddenly and was accompanied by the above described chest pain and has not dicipated to date.   I went to the ER and was given multiple EKG's, chest x-ray, bloodwork, and a quick neurology exam... all of which came back normal.  Further follow up with my usual doctor entailed a full range of bloodwork, EKG, chest x-ray, 24 Hour Holter Monitor, Treadmill Stress Stest (22 minutes total, stopped due to leg discomfort), and brain MRI... all were normal.   My doctor chalked this up to anxiety and perscribed me paroxetine (20mg/day) and lorazapam (.5mg/day).  I have been consitently taking those medications for 1.5 months now and have noticed only a very subtle deacrease in the dizziness and chest pains. I have a family history of diabetes and heart disease on my father's side of my family. My glucose has been tested repeatedly and shows up normal.  Began taking vasotec (10mg/day) 2 years ago for high BP (140/105) and this has brought my BP into a consistent range of (115/80).  Began taking lopid (600mg/day) 2 years ago for high triglycerides (fasting was 1047, HDL and LDL were very healthy though) and this has brought my fasting tryclycerides into a consistent (125-140). Are all the tests that I've had enough to fairly positively rule out an underlying cardiac problem or should more be done ?  Also, what could be the significance of the increased dizziness after eating ?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Ongoing dizziness & chest pains",
    "content": "Dear bos617,  After going on the treadmill for 22 minutes, i can say that most probably the chest pains that you have are not due to coronary disease.  What do you mean by dizziness? This is a very important question to answer.  Are you having any other symptoms such ringing in your ears or decreased hearing that is associated with the dizziness?   Do you feel out of balance sometimes? Ever fallen down? Any other symptoms like blurring of vision, difficulty speaking, difficulty moving any of your limbs?   This dizziness could be either related to an ear problem (in this case, you have to see an ear specialist) or related to a neurological problem (in this case, you have to be seen by a neurologist).  The significance of getting dizzier after you eat could be secondary to less blood going to your brain after heavy meals because the blood is diverted towards your gut to help digestion and absorption.  Even though your blood pressure has been stable and the dose of vasotec has not changed over the last 2 years, i would suggest that you either lower the dose of vasotec to see the effect of this on your dizziness or have 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to see whether or not your blood pressure dips lower than you think it does during the day.

    "content": "Thank you for your response.  My condition has not changed to date (still lightheaded with intermittent chest pains almost all day).  I have noticed that I feel relatively less dizzy when I get up in the morning, and by about 10:30am during the workday, I start to increase in dizziness.  However, this dizziness has not gotten so intense that I have passed out, but do get tingles in my arms (mostly left arm) and slightly blurred vision from time to time.  I have been testing my BP on my own and have gotten readings in the middle of the day that are lower than I have ever seen before. (the diastolic has gotten down to the low 50's with a systolic of just over 100).  I have also been developing a stiffness along the sides of my neck lately.  One test I have not had yet is an echo, do you believe this would be worthwhile ?  Also, you mentioned that the vasotec may be causing this even though I have been on it for two years w/o complications.  Is it possible that my body has gotten heathier over the past two years to the point that I don't need the vasotec anymore and now its just dropping my BP from a non-hypertensive state to a hypotensive state ?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear bos617,  Thank you very much for the update.  i am not sure what else you have been doing to reduce your blood pressure in addition to taking medications like losing weight, low salt diet or exercise. But the dose of an antihypertensive can vary from time to time according to how the body reacts to it in addition to whether or not you have been doing anything else to better control your blood pressure. Or may be you have been taking medications that increase the effect of vasotec or cause lowering in the blood pressure.  After what you said, i am now more convinced that this is secondary to vasotec. i would recommend that you discuss reducing the dose of vasotec with your physician or get a 24 hour ambulatory continuous blood pressure monitoring to see how low does your blood pressure reach.  One more thing, please, check your blood pressure when you are laying down and when you are standing up. If when you are standing up is much lower then call your doctor.

    "title": "Head pain, dizziness, tightness in chest",
    "content": "I had a sudden onset of severe headpain/dizziness/diahrrea on Oct 1st at 11pm at night.  These symptoms lasted severely for 8 weeks (I was in bed for this time) until the continuous head pain/dizziness broke mysteriously, afterwhich, I started to feel tightness in my chest.  I was unable to work until I could go at least 6 hours without headpain.  Now, after being up and about during the day for about 6 hours, I get the head pain.   Most of the time I have the tightness in my chest and I get increasingly fatigued as the hours of the day pass.  I am at my best right when I wake up.  As the hours pass, the chest pain increases, the head pain appears and I get increasingly exhausted by the hour.  The only thing that stops the symptoms is going to sleep.  Im assuming the rest/sleep refreshes my body.  The only problem is, I cannot sleep every day at 2pm or go to sleep in the middle of say, Christmas festivities. In addition, all of the symptoms get significantly worse during my \"period \" (is it hormone related??) and during periods of stomach distress (diahrrea - is it the fact that food/nutrients are leaving my body quickly/suddenly).  Is it soething to do with the nervous system?  or sugar? hormones?   Can someone help me figure out what this is?  I thought it would be sugar related (lack of) but even eating doesnt help (only slight improvement and then the symptoms reappear right away.  I want to be normal again - I want to wake up feel good and stay feeling good until 10pm at night.  Please help.  Thank you.  Jill foffie@aol.com\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jill,  Eight weeks with diarrhea is a long time, how many pounds did you lose? i assume that you were admitted to the hospital for a complete work-up, what was the diagnosis that you were given? Did you have fever with these headaches and with the diarrhea?  It looks that all of the neurological tests to rule out an intracranial process were done and they came back negative so this is a relief.  i am not sure what could have caused all of these symptoms together namely diarrhea (eventhought sometimes it comes with constipation) and headaches except may be for one infectious disease which is typhoid fever but as its name entitles it has to have fever as an integral part of its symptomatology.  What you are suffering from now, i think, is a recuperation period which is most probably going to be as long as your disease period if not longer. i think you will have to be more patient and hopefully everything is going to be fine.

The pain was so bad that I put my hand up to my chest cause of the pain.  Last night I was going to sleep and then I could not stop coughing.  I was coughing for hours until I took something for Asthma thinking that was the problem.  No it wasn't so I took some  theraflu and was able to go to sleep at 2am.  This morning I got ready for work and around 8 am I am experiencing mild chest pain and slight cough but not as much as last night.  The pain hurts right in the middle of my chest by my heart and inbetween my breast it feels like the pain starts to the front of my chest and I can feel it in my back as well now.  Yesterday I only felt the chest pain.  About 2 months ago I went to my doctors for chest pain that I had in one month only  two  times during the month before I went to the doctors, and she did an EKG on me which she said looked fine.  Please advise.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Babette,  Where was the pain exactly? Did it go any where else? How long did it last? What were you doing when you had the chest pain? How did it go away?  Your pain sounds atypical, but you have one of the major risk factors of coronary disease and that is smoking. Still, you are a female, not at the age that would be considered a risk for coronary disease, you don't have any of the other disease that are considered major risk factors for coronary disease such as hypertension or diabetes and you mentioned that you don't have any family history of coronary disease.  The chances of this being coronary related is somewhat small.  This pain could be related to either reflux disease or the cough that you have been having.  After consulting with your doctor, i would suggest trying medications for reflux and musculoskeletal pain.

I also experience pressure and mild pain in my chest. If I rest for about 15 min or so it seems to go away.... My doctor suggests it may be panic attacks but I don't display any of the other symptoms associated with them.... He also suggested that it may be Angina. I cannot do a treadmill test because of my back and will have to do the chemical stress test...He will not order one until my BP is under control..... I guess my question is...I am 30, not overweight, otherwise healthy...Is it possible for me to have Angina at such a young age and should I be very concerned?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Smartz,  It is not unheard of to have a heart attack at such a young age even though coronary disease is usually considered at an older age.  To determine whether or not chest pain is caused by coronary disease, 2 main factors are considered, the first is the risk factors that the patient having the chest pain has for coronary disease and the second is the character of the pain itself. If the patient has many risk factors for coronary disease and the chest pain is typical of coronary disease, the patient is taken to coronary angiography. If there are no risk factors and the chest pain was atypical there is not even a need for any other investigation.   Any thing in between, as in your case, a stress test is usually done. If i may, i would like to recommend to have the chemical test associated with a nuclear scan to better evaluate the heart.

Back to sleep, awoke feeling fine  3rd stood up from breakfast and hovered on the edge of conciousness for several seconds, came to on the floor feeling unwell.  Went to emerg, all bloodwork normal.  EKG showed only known right bundle branch block and ???left anterior hemi block...or something close to that.  4th Went to urinate middle of the night.  Was fine then a bit woozy for a couple seconds, resolved then maybe 20 seconds later severe and protrated wooziness.  Lowered myself to the floor.  Next clear awarenwss I was gasping uncontrollably and sweating.  lasted a long time...or it seemked so, maybe a minute or two then I was able to rise unsteadily and make it to the bed.  Saw the GP, am being scheduled for head CT and one other test I forget now.   5th after dinner, sat in car on verge of losing conciousness for perhaps 15 secs, was able to take pulse immediately following, while still quite woozy.  Couldn't cordinate looking at watch at the time, but pulse was solid and VERY slow.   A bit of history now... Tried the Atkins diet anbd felt poorly ...noticed serious arrythmia while symptomatic and consulted cardiologist who found the two EKG abnormalities noted above.  He was unconcerned, mentioned that a \"normal\" diet was step 1 and \"down the road\" I may need ..or may nhot need a pacemaker.  This was roughly 1 year ago.  What should I do...wait patiently or be more proactive.  If it is heart related...what are the odds that I won't recover from an attack?  245 lbs 6' in poor physical condition.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Passing out",
    "content": "Dear User,  The heart has electrical wires that conduct the electricity to its various parts to make it contract. There are 2 main wires, the right bundle and the left bundle (the left bundle consists of 2 wires the left anterior and the left posterior fascicles). As every thing else in the body, with age, these bundles degenerate. Your right bundle and left anterior fascicle (that's 2 of the 3), as evidenced on the electrocardiogram, are degenerated. That's what it is meant by right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicle block, so your heart has only one wire left, the left posterior fascicle.  It could be getting to the point of degeneration that it is going to have a block as well. This means that the attacks that you have been having are warnings that your conducting system has worn out. When there is no electricity, there is no heart contraction and there is no blood flow to the brain and you lose consciousness.  Your description of having a very slow pulse is consistent with that because when the original heart wiring is blocked, there is an intrinsic back-up system for the heart to initiate and conduct electricity once more but this back-up is much slower than the original. And as it takes a while for a generator to kick in after the electriciy goes off, it is the same with the heart. It takes a while for the back-up system of the heart to kick-in.  You have to see your cardiologist immediately as you might need a pacemaker. Having a 24 hours Holter monitor most probably is not needed in your case.  i would urge you to refrain from driving or operating any heavy machinery for the time being.  Passing out has lots of other causes but this is the most obvious one for the time being in your case and i think it has to be dealt with as soon as possible.

I went to the ED where my rate stayed up in the 140's and my pressure went up to as high as 101 diastolic.  2 doses of Cardizem IV did nothing.  Toprol XL 50 mg PO brought everything down.  All cardiac enzymes, EKG, CXR and Spiral CT were normal.  An Echo showed normal CO with evidence of myxomatous degeneration without evidence of regurgitation or prolapse.  I was discharged on Toprol 25 mg PO QD.  My pressure and heart rate remained low (90/60 and HR 83) for almost 24 hours.  Today - 2 days later, my blood pressure was 135/101, with HR 101 to 91.  This was before taking Toprol.  After the Toprol, my pressure was 130/80, HR 76.  My oxygenation has always been 96-100% throughout this and my chest pain has been minimal when the rate is down.  Is this anything I should take action on.  Should I just give the Toprol some time?  My pressure has always been low as a baseline (90/60) and my heart rate has always been in the low 60's.  Should I get a second opinion.  Is it ok to be tachy with a high diastolic like that?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear mersek,  The high blood pressure that you had originally could have just been due to you being stressed out because of the chest pain and may be the tachycardia.  But with your diastolic blood pressure being that high (i am not sure whether you stopped taking the toprol or not), you are hypertensive by definition especially if these readings were made on three different occasions during the same week.  Even though this could be good old essential hypertension, yet i would suggest that causes of secondary hypertension be looked for.

    "content": "The last few months i have had pains in my chest and arms, The pains have come and gone, and don't seem to show up too much at all during exersise. The pain in my left shoulder has been a concern to me the last few days as it has been aching under my left shoulder a little. The ache is hard to explain. The pain also goes acrros my left shoulder balde at times. The Doctor has taken blood on several occasions as i was taken into hospital for them to diognose me with panic attack. Although since then i have not had any panic attacks, but hav still been suffering with chest pains, and pains going accross the left side f my ches and my ribs also have had this aching go accross them.   I am concerned about my health but the doctor looks at me and as i am young 18 years of age, assumes there is little wrong. I am going to see my doctor on wednesday and will ask him to do my blood pressure again, all blood pressure tests before have shown up ok.  The last few days i have come down with a fever, which i think is Flu. Since this started off my heart rate has been about 104ish when i had it measured by an ECG yesterday. I just hope i am not going to have a heart attack, or that i have a narrowing or blockage in some artchery! Is there anything that can be done to check for blockages or narrpings and would blood pressure go up? also is ny fever causing my heart rate to increase? do i need an echocardiogram? and should i have a 24 hour monitoring? i am rather worried about dying so young as the thought has crossed my mind.  I also get like muscle spasm sensation in my legs more so my right leg, in my calf muscle which feels like something moving around and worried that this could be a blood clot of some sort? as i have been getting aches in my legs recently, although this could be down to the flu virus i think i have.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Josh,  You don't have any of the coronary disease risk factors and your chest pain is atypical as compared to the pain caused by coronary disease, so the chances that the pains that you are getting being of coronary origin (i.e. caused by a heart attack) are virtually nonexistent.  But this does not mean that the chest pains that you are having could not originate from the heart. In your age group, there is a condition called mitral valve prolapse that can lead to atypical chest pains.  This condition can be detected by echocardiography. i think at this point, it is better that you have an echocardiography.  Chest pain/shoulder pain/shoulder blade pain can be caused by many other causes, but this pain sounds more of muscular origin to me.  Fever increases the heart rate, so there is nothing to worry about from this aspect.  Thank you very much for using our website http://www.doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

He said..  my BMI is 17.5!!! should be 19+ i have a spastic colon which is palpaple in left iliac fossa? increased resonance in the abdomen coated tongue many trigger points of Fibromyalgic Syndrome  PLASMA: PLATELET AGGREGATES with secretory vesicles are NOTED; these can indicate leaky gut, stress, diabetes mellitus, raised cholestorol or smoking (i don't smoke) so it is likley i have a leaky gut and high cholestoral)  LIPUID PLAQUE or ribbon is noted, indicating oxidative stress or a high saturated fat intake  CHOLESTORAL CRYSTALS are noted, indicating either oxidative stress or raised cholestoral levels - it may be advised to have your cholestoral levels checked. A few PARASITIC-LIKE PROTOZA are noted, indicating a 'leaky gut.' Many FUNGLE SPORES such as Candida are noted, indicating intestinal or systematic candidasis.  Medication...   Fluconazole 150MG capsule. Take one today and one in four weeks time. No perscription necessery. Please continue taking OMEGA-3 fish oils 1000mg 2 daily, Vitamin C 1000mg alternate daily Mineral Complex (EAP2 Minerals) vegetable capsules from BioCare These contain... Magnezium, zinc, manganese, silicon, copper, molybdenum, chronium, and selenuim. take one daily with food.  Selenuim Ace (extra) this is an atioxident. Take one daily.   L-Glutamine 500mg capsules. This is to improve the integrity of the lining of your gut linining.  That is pretty much the info i got from him, my blood pressure the other day when i had it done was slightly low, yet my heart rate was high? My NHS Doctor (National Health Service) doctor hasn't done much for me. My Cholestoral was when taken a total of 4.1 which 1.1 was HDL and the other 3.0 i think was LDL.  I also wonder if it could be thyroid perhaps being over reactive. At the moment i worked out my heart rate to be 108BPM over a ten second period and multipying it by 6.  I just want to feel well for christmas and for life if possible. But trying to get an echocardiogram here is rather difficult. The doctor said that was not needed as it was more for the chambers of the heart, he would rather try out a 24 hour monitoring, and i HAD TO ASK for that. No idea when he will do it, he said if my heart rate was coninuously fast after the fever, then he would give it a try. I feel aslthough i am over the fever but just still feel my heart rate is a lot faster than it should be. Yesterday before it started going faster, it was about 72 to 86ish BPM which wasn't too much of a worry. But it has started to speed up again\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the reply,  My main concern is that it is heart due to the aches andpains i am getting, i get most aching down my left arm, and shoulder. Sometims i get strange sensations on my right arm. I fear that the pains are a sign of this. I will see if i can get a thyroid blood test done, if it has not already been tested in an earlier blood test, although i guess it is good to have another one done.   The thing is the pains are also linked with me feeling a little light headed and tired, although this could be due to lack of sleep the last few nights. If i get a little more sleep perhaps this will help this. I don't smoke, drink really or anything bad like that. I used to eat a lot of junk food but the last year or so I have stayed off all things like that.   I am just a little worried that it is my heart. If it is my thyroid then that means i would have to have that removed? Still I will have to look into getting a blood test done sometime soon, and see if that is over or underactive, or ok. If it is ok then i guess something like an echocardiogram would be good. I have spoken to my doctor about an echocardiogram but he said that this would not be relevant, but if my heart rate continues a 24 hour ECG would be. My heart rate today is fairly normal, about 78ish so it is coming down again. It feels fairly regular. Once though i did when lying in bed hear it stop, then about 2 seconds later it went BOOM and started up again, which worried me a little!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Josh,  Thank you very much for the update.  Left shoulder and arm pain are not hallmarks of heart disease, if you sit on the computer a lot, this is most probably the reason behind your shoulder pains.   If you had a thyroid function test when you started to have the symptoms and it was normal, there is no need to have it done again.  An echocardiogram would be of value if it showed that you have mitral valve prolapse.  What you experienced, the sensation of your heart stopping and then the strong beat is the typical feeling that an early (some would call it extra) heart beat gives.

    "title": "Question about chest pain",
    "content": "I am a 34 year old obese female.  I have lost about 50 pounds within the past year. I started having shortness of breath along with chest discomfort about 6 or 7 months ago. I was sent for a treadmill stress tests and blood work which all came back normal  My cholesterol was borderline high being at 217.  In July I had surgery for a hernia, and they did a chest ct scan because of a previous chest xray coming back abnormal for something they saw on the lungs.  It came back normal, along with normal heart size. I've had ekg's all normal.  The shortness of breath kept bothering me so I got an appointment with a cardiologist in October.  He did another ekg, a blood test to check for heart failure, and and echocardiogram.  Everything was fine. He said that my heart looked healthly, and that I should live a long time heart wise.  Well within the past week I've developed chest pains under my left breast, that sometimes makes my arm cold feeling.  The pains are sort of sharp.  Also, my neck has been going numb for the past few years.  I had a carotid artery ultrasound almost a year ago for that and it came back normal.  My question is, can this still be heart related, even though I keep getting back normal results on all tests.  My father had a heart blockage that was found through the catherization.  Please give me your advice. I hate to go to my family doctor about it because he always says that it's nerves. THanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Question about chest pain",
    "content": "Dear Wendysease,  To consider whether or not the pain that a certain person gets is caused by coronary disease, doctors look at two things. First, the risk factors that this person has for coronary disease and second, the chest pain that the person gets and how typical are its characteristics in comparison to those of the chest pain experienced by patients who have coronary disease.  Regarding you risk factors, you did not mention what is your bad and good cholesterol. You also never mentioned if your dad ever had a heart attack and if so at which age? But i think that you are doing a great job by losing weight.  As to your chest pain, you only mentioned that you have pain under your left breast with some cold sensation in your arm, but you did not mention whether this pain goes anywhere else, how long it lasts, what brings it on, how does it go away, is it associated with any other symptoms?   If a patient has many risk factors for coronary disease and the chst pain is typical then the likelyhood that the pain is due to coronary disease is high and this patient goes to coronary angiography without even the need of going through a stress test.  If the patient has no or minimal risk factors, and the chest pain is atypical as in your case, then the chest pain is not due to coronary disease, and there is no need to even have a stress test because it is going to be negative, you already had a stress test and it was negative.  Obviously, I cannot rule out something as dangerous as a cardiac cause for your chest pain over the internet, but according to your description your chest pain is probably not secondary to coronary disease. Echocardiography can sometimes show other heart causes of atypical chest pain such as a condition known as mitral valve prolapse but your echo was normal.  Can this still be of heart origin? Anything is possible but this probability is extremely low.  Chest pain has so many non-heart related causes.  As regards to your shortness of breath, one very important cause was ruled out which was heart failure, but it has so many causes as well starting from being physically unfit to heart failure.  If you wish to, you can discuss being seen by a lung specialist with your doctor to see whether this shortness of breath is lung related.

    "title": "Body numbness problems on my limbs and face",
    "content": "Hi,  I'm a male 25 years old, 5'8'' weighing at about 150 pounds.  Lately i have been having body numbness problems on my limbs and face. I've had  a headache for a couple days now, and it feels strange even to walk and move. My head feels really heavy at times and lightheadedness at times. It seems like I have fluttering sensations in my chest area.  I'm not a smoker, and i have never been diagnosed with high blood pressure. I do have a light case of asthma but this doesnt seem to be ashma related. This has been going on for a couple days now.  I'm worried that it might be heart of stroke related.    Generally, my whole body feels week and numb. I cant seem to stay in one position for a long time because i start feeling pain in my limbs. It seems when i get up and walk around the pain decreases a little. I have mild sharp pains around me neck area around the back when i turn my neck soemtimes. I've tried taking ibuprofin and asprin, both don't seem to help in alleviateing the symtoms in my head. My fingers feel really stiff when i try to type or write. I'm also generally more pale then normal. And although i can see and think clearly my vision seems to be slightly effected making me a little dizzy.   Any imput woudl be appreciated. Thanks.\n\n",

Migraine is sometimes associated with neurological symptoms that are the result of severe blood vessel spasms and could lead to stroke somtimes.  i suggest that you see your primary care provider right away and if you can't get to see him right away, i think that you have to be seen in the emergency room.

    "title": "Chest discomfort, issues",
    "content": "I'm a 29 year old, 155 pound male.  I've had this weird sensation in my upper chest, through the lower part of my neck. It's not \"pain\" per se, but a discomfort. Things like my shirt, seatbelt, blankets, etc., irritate me. Sometimes it's more noticeable than others, but never enough to worry me.   I've had this \"discomfort\" for over four years now. I've never thought much about it until recently. Last week, the discomfort became extremely noticeable; constant. My heart seemed to be beating harder, faster. On Sunday, October 31, 2004, I felt a little nauseous, after moving some furniture for a friend, so I went home to rest.  Later that night, a friend suggested I should take my blood pressure. It was 187/90. After being told that was extremely high, I decided to take it again later; it was still near the same range. I understand that my high blood pressure could have been a result of me panicking about the situation. Knowing that, after a few readings over the course of a few hours, I decided to lay down and rest (I know you shouldn't do that many readings close together).  The more I sat there, the more thoughts started going through my head, probably bringing aout new sensations. My arms started tingling, my left arm started to feel hot. I finally gave in and went to the emergency room at 2 AM, which took alot considering I haven't been to a doctor since I was 13 (16 years ago). Dumb, I know.  I explained to them that I have this discomfort in my chest, that it irrates me when things rub against it; emphasizing it's not a pain, but discomfort.  I explained I've had this for 4 years and that it's now as bad as it's ever been.  They gave me an EKG, which was \"fine.\" They gave me a GI cocktail, which did nothing. They gave me a chest x-ray, which, I assume was fine, as they never commented on it.  After a few hrs, they gave me a prescription for myloxicam (an NSAID), for a chest sprain, as that's what he figured it was. After reiterating that I've had a lesser version of this feeling for 4 years, they said, \"I don't know why you'd have this for 4 years.\"  My BP reading when I got to the hospital was 154/70 something and 124/64 when leaving.  It's now THUR, Nov 4th and I still feel the same. My chest feels very heavy, during specific times, it actually feels as if it is burning (a slight burning sensation); in a centralized area, upper/center chest.  I have an appt to see a PCP for a general physical and such, Wed. Nov 10, 2004.  My questions are:(Knowing that you can't see me)  Any ideas? I do have slight asthma, but I don't seem to be too short of breath. My grandfather (mother's side) had a heart attack at 42, has had a few stents, has high blood pressure, and now is 80. My mother has severe asthma, supposed genitically high cholesterol, is on all sorts of medication, has an issue with her heart where 2 flaps are fused together, she's 51 and very, very ill.  My father's side, I have no clue. Maybe this background can help someone, at least a tad.  I'm extremly anxious about my WED appt, as, like everyone would feel, I have the whole world ahead of me.  Maybe someone can give me some information before my appt. I've been trying to post for a while, but I can't due to board restrictions that are in place. So, I've saved this and will try again.  If you can't help me, say a few prayers for Joe in Florida.  My best regards to all.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Joe,  Determining the origin of chest pain and whether or not it is of coronary origin depends on the risk factors the person experiencing chest pain has for coronary disease and the characteristics of the chest pain that the person has.  From looking at your profile, you have may be two risk factors for coronary disease, family history (your grandfather on your mother's side and i even say this with great caution even because family history means first degree relatives) and being a male.  The characterisitics of your chest pain are very atypical when compared to the characterisitics of chest pain caused by coronary disease.  Taking both of these into account (in addition to the normal ecg that you had while you had chest discomfort), i would say that the possibility of the chest pain that you are having being caused by coronary disease is very low.  Now, coming to the issue of high blood pressure. i think you have to follow your blood pressure closely to make sure that you are not going to have such high readings in the future.

    "content": "Dr.,  Thank you for your response. My blood pressure checks have been fine since the ER visit. After visiting my PCP, I've since had a basal cell cancer removed from my neck, as well as \"click\" diagnosed in my heart. I have an echocardiogram scheduled for this afternoon.  My chest sensations are still present and still nearly constant. From the center of my chest up through the lower part of my neck, even slightly outward near my shoulder blades; mainly concentrated in the center/upper part of my chest. The PCP has no idea what is causing them, but suggests I may have MVP, due to the newfound click in my heart.  It's a little scary when you visit the doctor and they're not really sure what's wrong with you. You, unfairly, expect them to tell you exactly what's wrong and what you need to do to fix it.  Unfortunately, that hasn't happened. I have a tough time explaining to them, my sensations. They understand what I'm saying, but do not have an answer. Part of me hopes the echo comes back with some information on what is causing these pains, but a large part of me hopes it shows nothing; that everything is in perfect working order.  But, with a click, no one knows. Funny though, the ER doc didn't mention anything about the click. This is all news to me; scary news.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Joe,  Thank you very much for the update.  There is nothing to be worried about.  A click is just a sound that a valve makes under certain conditions. Sometimes, it does not mean anything at all. However, let's wait for the echocardiography results. Mitral valve prolapse is not really a very serious condition unless associated with severe mitral valve regurgitation (blood going back to the left atrium where it should not), otherwise, if you have mitral valve prolapse, all you have to worry about is telling your dentist or doctor if you are going to have any medical procedure that you have mitral valve prolapse to receive antibiotics before the procedure, and to have follow up every year or so with an echocardiogram to see the progress of the prolapse.  i can not tell you the reasons behind the chest discomfort that you have.  If you are still worried about coronary disease, you can have an exercise stress test. If this pain continues, if i may, i would like to suggest you having a ct scan of the neck and chest to see if a cause of this chest pain could be identified.

    "title": "Vibrating sensation in chest",
    "content": "Dear Doctor, I am a 38 yo white male with a family history of heart disease (Dad died of CAD at 42, maternal Grandmother had 1st heart attach at 52). I was diagnosed with CAD in June and had angioplasty & 4 stents (Cordis drug eluding type) for 2 blockages each in my LAD & RCA. I suffered a complication, my artery was perforated during the proceedure and a pericardial effussion started, leading to cardiac tamponade and near death. An emergencey Pericardiocentisis followed along with days in the ICU with a drain in my chest, then several months of steroids to shrink the effussion. Follow up echoes show the effussion to be gome and no damage to my heart.   Yesterday I had an odd experience; I was awoken from sleep with a rapid heart beat (100 BPM) and an odd vibrating sensation in my chest. It felt as though an electrical charge was in my chest, like a motor was running perhaps. It stopped abruptly, like someone had shut a switch off, then started back up again. I had the same thing happen later in the day while I was nodding off to sleep in the afternoon. I also felt some palpitations during the events.  Have you ever encountered these types of symptoms before? If so, what might have caused it? My cardiologist is booked untill next week and I would appreciate any insight you might have on the matter in the meantime. Would it be wise to seek emergency care if this happens again?  Thank you for your help, Craig\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Craig,  With the atenolol, fast heart rate should be controlled, so most probably, the rate that you have is slower than it ought to be and this is a good thing.  Causes of arrhythmias can be various, but i think that it is most probably related to the pericardial disease that you had in the past. Have you been having any other new symptoms like shortness of breath or dizziness unrelated to the fast heart rate events?  i think you should be asking your doctor whether or not you should be increasing the atenolol dose even before you see him and see whether or not this alone will help control these episodes.  In my opinion, you have to have blood work to make sure that your electrolytes are within normal limits especially if you have been having any recent vomiting or diarrhea. Thyroid function tests are not unreasonable in these circumstances. An echocardiogram, a holter or an event monitor also most probably are going to be considered.  If during the event you start experiencing dizziness, or a feeling that you are going to faint or near blackening out, you should seek emergency medical attention immediately, because this means that there is not enough blood going to your brain and this means to your heart as well.

Perhaps this had some influence on the incident?  I have had palpitations many times before (wore a holter monitor for 24 hrs 7 weeks ago, told results were 'fine'), but I have never had this 'buzzing' or vibrating sensation before. I have also had bouts of dizziness, but without any other symptoms. I did not have them today at all. I did have diarrhea on the day I had the occurance, and for several days that week (I came home from a european vacation with a GI bug, i'm now on antibiotics for).   I have had two thallium stress tests in the past two months at two dfferent facilities results of both were negative.   The buzzing sensation scared me, i just put a call in to my cardiologist to see if he would reccommend increasing my atenolol from 25 mg am & pm until I see him.\n\n",

Diarrhea can lead to low potassium so, it is not a bad idea to go ahead and check your potassium level.  i don't think that you have to worry about the stents being blocked at this point because of the 2 negative stress thalium tests that you had because this was a short while ago.

    "content": "I am an healthy 18 year old female. Two months ago I started experiencing some odd symptoms. Chest pain, racing heart, hard to breathe (feel like I am being strangled), numbness in arms and legs and light-headed. The ambulance took me to the emergency room one day when it was really bad. The paramedics told my mom that I was throwing PVC's and at one point the EKG said it was supraventriculation. My heart rate would go from 60 beats up to 130 beats just sitting there in the ambulance barn. At one point it went up to 229 beats.  When I got to the ER, I had an abnormal EKG. they did blood work and I was very low on Potassium. The doctor in the ER ordered a event monitor, I wore it for two days for about an hour each day. I would put it on and it would automatically record without touching the button (they told me that was because my heart rate was over 100 beats, but I could be just sitting there and it would do it). They then placed me on a 24 hour continuous monitor and it didn't show anything. My doctor (who has not seen me when I am having an attack) feels that it is a panic attack. Now I am  having the feeling of blacking out. Things go almost black (tunnel vision) then everything gets real light, I feel kind of lost when this happens, my heart is racing and sometimes I get a headache. When this happens, I just sit on the floor until the feeling passes.  My question is should I just go along with the doctor's diagnosis or should I pursue this with a cardiology specialist? The doctor in the ER told me that she felt I was having some anxiety but felt there was something else going on....\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Susan,  How low was your potassium when you had this event? How often do you use your albuterol inhaler?  Arrhythmias can have lots of causes: 1. Heart diseases such as hypertension, coronary disease, congenital heart disease and certain valvular heart diseases. If your heart examination is normal (don't have any murmurs), i think it would be ok not to have an echocardiogram to check for any structural heart abnormality. 2. Abnormal electrolytes such as low potassium and low magnesium. Make sure that your potassium is always normal. Low potassium can be caused by not eating enough foods that contain potassium, if you are vomiting or having diarrhea or peeing too much. Sometimes medications such albuterol can lead to low potassium. If your potassium is consistently low, a low magnesium has to be ruled out.  3. Thyroid gland dysfunctions. You have to have your thyroid's functions checked. 4. Smoking. 5. Drinking too much alcohol. 6. Drinking too much caffeinated beverages. 7. Not having enough sleep. You have to stop smoking (if you are), drinking (if you are), try to keep caffein to a minimum and have enough sleep. 8. Certain medications can cause heart stimulation and abnormal heart beats such as albuterol. How about albuterol, if you have been using too much albuterol lately, it can cause both a low potassium and can excite the heart. 9. Having abnormal conduction systems in one's heart. This is usually the last thing to be searched for unless the ekg that you had show some abnormal features that is well known to emergency physicians and internists as well.  My recommendation is (after you stop smoking, drinking, cut caffein and have enough sleep) to make sure that your thyroid functions are normal. Make sure that your potassium level is always normal. And if this continues to be a problem, then you might want to consult with a cardiologist.

I have just gone on birth control, and I'm wondering if this could be a side effect?  I'm 30 years old, a smoker and I drink coffee (about 3 cups a day).  I've also been under a reasonable amount of stress recently.  I've been reading on palpitations and it seems that they can be caused by any of these factors.   I also had surgery in 1981 for a patent ductus arteriosis.  I don't think this is related at all, I haven't had any complications with it and haven't been to a cardioligist since around that same time.  My question is, should I go to the doctor or should I wait to see if it continues?  When do palpitations require seeking medical help?  My biggest concern right now is that I don't have health insurance.  Any advice would be really helpful.  Thank you,  Kristina\n\n",

The chest pain that you have been having have some typical and some atypical characterisitcs of pain caused by coronary disease.  Obviously, I cannot rule out something as dangerous as a cardiac cause for your chest pain over the internet, but according to your description this chest pain is probably not secondary to coronary disease.  The characteristics of the chest pain that you have been having are not typical of costochondritis also, i think what you might be having is esophageal spasms and/or reflux.

    "title": "Re: Signs of heart attack and nitroglycerin",
    "content": "Dear Sandy,  Nitroglcerin is not the definitive treatment of coronary disease, it is just symptomatic treatment. Many patients don't get nitroglcerin when they are having a heart attack but rather other medications that aim at dissolving the blood clot in the clogged coronary artery and a medication that decreases the stress on the heart in addition to aspirin and heparin (a blood thinner).  Nitrolglycerin helps controlling the chest pain that patients have.  The problem with nitroglycerin is that it causes lowering in the blood pressure and this in turn causes less blood to go to the coronaries with aggravation of the ischemia that is already taking place. In addition to this, low pressure in itself is not a good thing to begin with as it might cause other organs such as the kidneys to fail.  If the patient who has chest pain has a low blood pressure. This could be caused by many things and not just a heart attack. But let's assume that the pain is truly caused by a heart attack and that the patient has low blood pressure, there are a couple of possibilities behind the low blood pressure. The first one is that an inferior myocardial infarction (a heart attack that affects the lower wall of the heart). In this case, if the patient gets nitroglycerin, lower blood pressure will definitely ensue and the consequences could be harmful to the patient. The right move at this point is, in addition to giving the above mentioned medications, intravenous fluids are given to increase the blood pressure and if the physician wants to give nitroglycerin, it will be at a very small dose.  The second possibility is that the patient might have a big heart attack leading to acute heart failure and low blood pressure. In this case, nitroglycerin is optional as well, and if the medication that dissolves the clot does not work, then emergency cardiac catheterization is performed to open the artery (sometimes even the medicine that dissolves the blood clot is not given and the patient is taken to cardiac cath immediately if it is readily available, to save time).

    "content": "Dear Peeler,  You are suffering from what is known as premature beats, and like you described it exactly, the heart beats earlier (you think it is missing a beat) and the following beat is stronger than the ones preceding and the ones following.   The causes of premature beats are numerous, but the most common are lack of sleep, smoking, drinking too much caffeinated beverages, drinking alcohol, stress. In addition there are other diseases that can cause that usually a person is checked for abnormal electrolytes (which can be caused by vomiting and diarrhea) and thyroid disease, there is also a heart condition known as mitral valve prolapse that can lead to occasional palpitations.  My recommendation is to get enough sleep, stop smoking and drinking whether caffeinated beverages or alcohol and see what happens, if the palpitations still continue, then you need to be seen to have blood work and may be get an echocardiogram if your physician think it is necessary.

They sent me to my gastro dr because i have severe heartburn and he has upped me to 3 prevacids daily and done 2 endoscopes...shows acid scarring (mild) and states it could be some type of esphogeal spasms and put me on levisin. Sometimes I think it helps and sometimes it doesnt. Since it comes and goes its hard to say if it has helped or not. This has been a bad week with it.

    "title": "Re: Strange sensations in chest and shortness of breath",
    "content": "Dear pjcag,  Whether or not the chest pain that anyone sufferes from is due to coronary disease depends on the risk factors that the person has for coronary disease and the characteristics of the chest pain itself.  As regards to risk factors, you have a positive family history of premature coronary disease with your sister having a bypass at the age of 52. You have high cholesterol. You never mentioned whether or not you smoke. You don't have high blood pressure or diabetes. You being diagnosed with nash most probably means that you are on the obese side and also you never mentioned anything about your activity level.  As regards to the characteristics of the pain, even though the pain has one charateristic of the typical pain of coronary disease (which the sqeezing sensation) yet, you never mentioned whether or not it is related to exercise, whether the pain goes somewhere else or just remains in the middle of your chest, what are the things that make it worse or better and what are the things that are associated with it (if any) such as nausea, vomiting, sweating, palpitations, etc...  You have other conditions that can cause the chest pain like you mentioned, and this can be really confusing sometimes.  Personally, i think you need a stress test to start evaluating this pain. At this point, if the pain improves, i don't think you need a cardiologist to see you. The stress test could be done by your primary care provider and only if the stress test results come back abnormal that you need to see a cardiologist.  If this chest pain is getting worse, i would suggest that you seek medical attention by going to the er to be evaluated by having an ekg and blood work.

    "content": "Last night my husband had another episode where his heart went crazy.  It lasted about 25 minutes.  I tried to take his pulse but it was off the charts.  It happens periodically.  Mostly when he exerts himself with strenuous physical activity, or when he is nervous.  It isn't a \"rapid heart rate\" it's like his heart gets stuck.  He gets clammy and nervous, and eventually if he bears down and beats his chest, he will get dizzy and can feel it fall back into a normal beat. He does not smoke, and doesn't drink caffiene. He has had an ekg that reads normal.  The odd thing is that it has happened to me twice as well.  I had to go to the ER and have a shot that stopped and restarted my heart back into normal rhythm.  What causes this?  Is it dangerous? and is it possible there is something in our house, etc. that would cause both of us to experience such a scary thing?\n\n",

A simple EKG is not enough. I would suggest a Holter EKG if you haven't already had one done. This would monitor the heart rythm throughout the day. Discuss this with your doctor and inform me with the results.\n\n",

I was involved in a car accident 4 years ago and had therapy on my left shoulder to try to get back full range of motion. My cholestrol is low and my doctor said my good cholesterol was fantastic. My BP was 123-74 last time I checked. I exercise at times...do not feel the pain then or out of breath. Ive experienced tingling in fingers at times..but in both hands. Am I nuts to worry?\n\n",

You hardly have 2 risk factors that can not be changed, being a male and 44 years old. You don't have any of the other risk factors and you don't have any typical chest pain characteristics, so the probability that this left shoulder pain and skin sensitivity is secondary to coronary disease is very slim if at all present.

    "title": "Chronic pain syndrome",
    "content": "I'm a 27 yr old white-male; 6ft 3 in, 230 lbs. I was diagnosed with high BP in mid-March 2004. I was given 10mg of Lisinopril at the time, and I weighed about 290 lbs. I still take 5mg of Lisinopril, but am hoping to be off it soon with continued weight loss.  In mid-June 2004, I was diagnosed with GERD. The diagnosis was based solely on the symptoms I reported, digital exam, and blood work. No imaging or follow up testing was performed. I was prescribed 150mg of Zantac 2xs daily for a month. The symptoms didn't improve at all. At the follow-up, I was given 20mg of Prilosec 1x daily. Again, no improvement in the symptoms.   Since that time, I started getting this really severe pain on my left side, kind of parallel to the bottom portion of the rib cage. It radiates into my back and left chest. However, I get pain in the left side of my chest without the side pain as well.  The chest pain is usually just below the left breast region, and shoots up to a little above my nipple. It also heads towards the center from time to time. I've also been getting pain in my left shoulder and arm as well. The pain is seemingly not brought on by anything that I can think of.  I also experience severe abdominal pain, mostly around my belly button, to the left of it, and lower to the left of it. I am also nauseated most of the time, have vomitted here and there, and get cold and the chills real easily.   I told my dr about all of this when I saw him last in early August, and he basically couldn't come up with an explanation and said I could have a chronic pain syndrome or that my nerves were more sensitive to the pain than normal. I basically decided to just live with the symptoms and decided that I would only seek medical attention for them if it got to the point where I couldn't take it anymore.  In late August 2004, I went to another dr because the pains were getting bad again. I told him everything and he did blood work, a digital exam, abdominal x-rays, and an abdominal ct where I had to drink two glasses of iodine laced juice. Everything came back normal, and this dr said, and I quote \"some people get headaches, some people get stomach aches. You seem to be in the last group. I see you had a ct done last summer and it was normal too.\" I responded by telling him that it was normal, and I also had my appendix removed 3 hours after the ct was taken. He was inserting his foot into his mouth at that point. He did give me 40mg 1xdaily of Protonix though, as he thought they might help more than the Zantac or Prilosec. However, the Protonix has done nothing.   It is now late September, and I still am experiencing all of the symptoms I listed above. My BP is usually in the 110s/70s, pulse in 60s. So in a sense I'm not worried that this is heart related. But at the same time I am, because of the location of the pains and stuff. I really don't know what to do or who to see. I'm hesitant to go back to my dr, as he was basically clueless when I saw him last. I also don't want to go back to the dr I saw last, as I was less than thrilled with his professionalism or lack there of. I've been tempted to go to the ER when the side pain really kicks in, but have decided not to. I live in a small city, and have a health plan that limits who my primary care provider can be. I also need referrals for any tests and specialists that are not ordered by my phcp or in an emergency setting. I'll stop babbling now. Any advice, insight, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "I saw my dr today. I wasn't planning on it, but I was awaken at about 4 a.m. with a strange feeling in the area that I can best describe as where the chest and abdomen meet. I felt really nauseated...like I needed to vomit or belch like never before. I couldn't though. I also had a hard time getting comfortbale, and subsequently back to bed. I tosed and turned, and eventually was able to get a few more hours of sleep.   When I woke up, I still had that weird feeling so I called my dr's office. They got me in and I told him, again, what's going on, as well as the onset of this new discomfort and its location. He took me of the Protonix, as he doesn't think I have GERD...he's not the only one   . He also said that the CT results pretty much rule out gallbladder or other issues.  He drew blood, took a urine sample, ordered a chest x-ray where they also x-rayed my left side. I won't know the results of the lab work for a while, but the x-ray tech said the images looked good. But she also said that she is not the radiologist so her word is not official.   I talked to my dr about this all possibly being heart related, and he didn't think it was a serious possibility. This is despite the pains in my left shoulder, upper arm, upper-mid back, side, and chest. Again, all on the left side. As well as the discomfort in the area where the abdomen and chest meet. I told him I was concerned it could be, but he didn't want to order anything like an echo or stress test. I do believe he included the cardiac markers as part of my blood work though. I hope.   Despite all of this, I still feel clueless and frustrated. Any advice and insight is most welcome.\n\n",

You have some risk factors that you had for a short while but the pain characteristics are not typical of coronary disease, so the chance of this being heart related is small.   Regarding your abdominal pain, it is not easy for me to tell what is causing it but if you have not been seen by a gastrointestinal specialist may be it is time to do so. An endoscopy might be indicated to try and get to the bottom of your problem.   Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "Hello, I am a 23 yr old female or good health. I have not had any significant illnesses or conditions. I have a vast family history of heart problems, diabetes, and cancer, but I have not been diagnosed with anything. I am writing because I had an episode where I passed out and the doctor tested me because she heard an irregular heart beat. I had an Echocardiogram, and wore a holter monitor for 24 hours and the results indicated I had PVCs. We decided not to take any actions because I had only one episode of passing out. But, I have sinced passed out a few times. Most often, it happens in the shower in the mornings. I am now very aware of it and am able to catch it before I actually pass out, but occassionally I actually pass out. I have tried to alter my diet, exercise, caffeine intake, to no avail. I do not drink alcohol or use tobacco or any other drugs. My concern is that given my father's history, this may be serious. My father had his 1st heart attack at age 38, suffered congestive heart failure at 47, had open heart quadrupal bypass surgery at age 50, and heart failure again at age 53. I am wondering if this is something I should worry about and check out or it if is probably denign. I am also wondering if my constant battle with Strep throat when I was a young teen could have contributed to anything. Any help would be great. Thank you, Tracy\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Shue,   Totally agree with Theresa.   The cause of syncope has to be determined and whether or not the passing out that you have been experiencing is related or not to the pvcs that were found at one point is not known.   The work-up of syncope usually involves a long list of investigations and in most of the cases, it is not helpful in finding out the cause.   You will have to see a cardiologist, you already had an echocardiogram the results of which are unknown to me but i will assume that it was normal since you never mentioned anything abnormal about it. Since the echocardiogram is normal, the strep throats that you had never affected the heart.   For the repeated syncopal episodes, most probably you will have a tilt table test which is usually done and interpreted by cardiologists.

    "content": "Hi, I'm going to give a brief medical history.  Round the end of 2001, I began suffering from Chronic Urticaria.   Fortunately, using anti histamine (TELFAST) medication, controlled my urticaria.  I ran various tests and blood work.  I made a full blood count, liver function tests, thyroid tests, urine test, etc and everything was within nominal range.  After about 2 years, urticaria vanished on its own. During the period when I had chronic urticaria, I began suffering from episodes of severe chest pain whic sometimes radiated to my left arm, shoulder, arm pit and jaw.  I suspected heart problems and visited my GP which suggested I had nothing.  After recurring episodes and worsening of symptoms,  I decided to visit a specialist.  He ordered various tests including FBC, ECG, Stress ECG, Chest X-Ray, Abdominal Ultrasound and Barium Swallow.  All results came back good with no abnormalities found.  Nowadays I still suffer from episodes of Chest Pains and am even having episodes of shortness of breath.  What could be the cause of such symptoms?  Sometimes I have chest pain without breathing problems, sometimes I have shortness of breath without chest pain and sometimes I have both.  After running all these tests showing no evidence of serious problems, what could be the reason of such symptoms?  Could it be a psyhcological problem, stress, panic?  Thanks and please help.  Sorry for being long.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mikezam,   Determination of whether chest pain is of cardiac origin or not depends on risk factors that the patient has for coronary disease and the characteristics of the chest pain itself.   The risk factors for coronary disease are  1. Family history of coronary disease in young family members.  2. Age. Older people are more prone to heart attacks.  3. Being a male.  4. Hypertension.  5. Diabetes.  6. Smoking.  7. High choleterol.  8. Sedentary life style.   So, it looks that you don't have any of these risk factors except being a male. So, most probably the chest pain that you are having is not related to coronary disease.   You never mentioned what the characteristics of the pain that you get are. Characteristics of the pain are also an important factor in determining whether the pain is of coronary origin or not.  But i guess that this a little bit late since you already had all the tests and it is relief that they came back normal.  You have not mentioned whether or not you had an echocardiogram. Sometimes, chest pain can be caused by mitral valve prolapse which is usually detected by echocardiogram. Another cause of chest pain is also neck problems.  Panic attacks can cause chest pain but i usually do not like to attribute symptoms to pschiatric problems till all the other causes have been ruled out.

I am not overweight, by means of my BMI, but I am on ortho evera \u201cthe patch.\u201d This week I noticed a small \u201cbruise\u201d in the same location as the pain.  When I touch it, it does not hurt, but it is round like a bruise.  At first, my leg itched as well, but it no longer itches, it just hurts.  Also up until yesterday the pain was only at night, now the pain in persisting into the day.  I also had taken two weeks off from working out (5days a week) so now I today I was going to walk at the gym to see if the blood flow would help the pain.  I have put pillows under my legs at night.  Also I am having a little bit of pain in my chest, near my collar bone by my neck as well as near the bottom of my rib cage.  I have read about DVT, but since I can see that I some sort of varicose vein like systems in my legs (meaning it looks like I have some on my legs) should I be concerned?  Also my age is 21, I have never smoked, no surgeries or illnesses or prolonged bed rest (I have just been much less active).  I also have had to blood tests for unrelated issues in the past two weeks, would they have seen anything there?  Any help would be great.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi girlie, A DVT can not be detected by a blood test. It can, however, be detected by an ultrasound. My questions are: does the pain become worse when walking? Have you been short of breath? My concern is since you are on birth control, blood clots can be a side effect regardless of age. Many other conditions  could as well be considered but I would suggest that you make an appointment with your family doctor to have this evaluated. If a blood clot is suspected DO NOT massage the area or increase physical activity as this will cause additional complications. I hope this helps. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "35 years old male. Normal weight. No history of cardiac disease. Blood pressure usually under 120/80. Normal cholesterol. Non smoker. No alcohol.  Blood pressure medication (enalapril 10mg/day) because of glomerulonephritis I had in 1991 and 1997. Currently no trouble with kidneys -- kidney function normal, no protein in urine etc.  1mg Xanax/day and 30mg Remeron/day because of generalised anxiety disorder I developed this spring.  The question is about my heart rate.  My resting heart rate is usually 50-60bpm. I have seen it drop as low as 42bpm in rest. Normally my heart rate is in 70-80bpm range when I walk around the house for example. It goes to 110-120 range on a brisk walk or to 130 when I climb up stairs to the third floor.  However, I have begun to experience following symptons lately: my resting heart rate can be as slow as 50bpm, but when I get up and walk even a little, it shoots up to 100-120 range and stays there as long as I'm up. If I go lie down, the heart rate slows back to \"normal\" resting rate rather quickly. Climbing up the stairs can bring the heart rate over 150 now!  This has made me extremely anxious!  I've had blood tests for thyroid function, heart enzymes, hemoglobine, crp etc. and they all came back normal. Also I had a resting ecg that indicated: \"sinus bradycardia - otherwise normal\". (I had heart rate 50bpm during the test.) I am also scheduled for a 24h holter monitoring in two weeks.  What could possibly cause such a huge increase in heart rate? I should be in a fair shape, since I used to walk 1,5h daily, but now I'm afraid to exercise, because of the high heart rate. This is making my life really miserable! I'm constantly checking my pulse, and worrying about my heart. (I know I should not, but I can't help it.)  What's wrong with me? Please, any suggestions?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sneakers,  The funtion of the lung as simple as it can be put is to supply oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.  The bad headaches that you are experiencing can be due to: 1. Insufficient breathing during the night causing you to have carbon dioxide retention. 2. Having sinusitis which is known to cause a very bad headache.  The chest burning can be caused by the shortness of breath sensation.  You have to stop smoking once and for all.  If these symptoms continue, you will have to go to a doctor. You are on prescription medications that you should not take except under a physician's supervision.

It is a extremly stressful time in my life right now I lost my mother a few months ago to heart and lung diease and now my father is in ICU on a ventilator and appears to have suffered sever brain damage due to heart attack and several resp. arrests. I have been staying at the hosptial day and night. I can't afford to leave My Dad for long as fragil as he is, Also my Dr. just left family practice so I don't have a primary care Dr. right now. My specalist doesn't treat lung problems they are pain management and orthopedic and podiatry. I was hoping you would be able to tell me what or if. I could do to help me get over what I do believe is a very bad asthma attack as it has been very steamy weather and summer is just a bad time of year for my asthma. Many years ago I have statis Asthmaticus and was put on the vent myself. Lately I have been waking with very bad headaches and very short of breath to the point I can hardly inhale or exhale. I am very worried. I just can't afford to get sick and not be at the hospital with my Dad. Someone told me to drink black coffee and it would help my asthma. This is a very hard time for me and As you can see I have many heath issues myself. I was hopeing there would be a home remedy to help me get my lungs up and me feeling better without having to leave my Dad his prognosis is extremely poor and I want to be with him. All of my meds are perscribed and monotored very well by my Dr's. I hope I have cleared any miss understanding about what I am asking.

This is a very stressful situation that you are facing, i hope that there is someone standing besides you during all that suffering.  i am not in a position to tell what to do regarding your dad, but it seems that your dad's prognosis is very grave, you will have to ask yourself together with other family members what your dad would have wanted done if he ever ended up in this condition that he is in right now.  If you are having a bad asthmatic episode, the treatment at this time would be either systemic inhaled steroids and i think that you already had your round with systemic steroids and had some bad side effects in terms of your hip problems. Inhaled steroids can have some mild systemic side effects. In your profile, i don't see any of the newer agents used to treat asthma like singulair or accolate.   i usually don't like to attribute symptoms to psychological causes except after exhausting all venues, but there is no doubt that you are going through a lot right now and if the headaches' start coincided with or started shortly after all these circumstances began, than i would also put this into consideration.   Another thing to think about is if you are overweight, you might want to consider being tested for sleep apnea.  Still, you can get a doctor's appointment at the hospital where your dead is unless you are away from home.  My recommendation is still to get an arterial blood gases to make sure that you are not having carbon dioxide retention and have x-ray of the sinuses to makes sure that you are not having sinusitis.

    "content": "Dear Yasser Mokhtar, M.D. Thank you for your reply in regard to my asthma. My Dads condition is very grim. It appears the brain damage is very sever.No I don't have any support. My sister is bi-polar which makes a very stressful time more stressful. But thats life you can't change it. So I take it one day at a time. In respect to my headaches and asthma. I did indeed have some very bad side effects to steroids. I have AVN in most of my joints. I tried advair and within a few months my ankles and feet went very bad. Don't know if it was the advair or a result from very large doses of Solu-Medrol years ago. But it was to late to be able to do anything for them. The headaches seem to be related to my breathing. They started a while back. it seems since I stopped taking the maintance meds and the asthma got worse the headaches started. One strange thing is I sometimes have dreams of someone telling me I have to wake up. Good thing to as I am in great distress and thats when I have the headaches so bad. They feel like migraines. Once I get up and use the nebulizer it feels a little better. It guess it could be sinus but I don't seem to have any symtoms of congestion that way. I was on accolate and it worked great. I thought my asthma was gone, but my liver enzymes went up so I had to stop taking it sinular doesn't help me at all. As soon as this crisis with My Father is over I will find a primary care Dr. and get the blood gases checked. E.R. visits are not an option very long waits and I can't afford to leave Daddy that long. Thank you very much for your reply. Tell me do you know anything about AVN and is there any meds. you know of that is being used to help bring the blood supply back to the effected joint. I just don't see surgery as a option. I have to many joints effected and fuseing my ankles doesn;t sound like a good option. If you know of anything that may be helpful I would be very greatful. God Bless Sneakers\n\n",

I know that my pulse is too high and it's beginning to really worry me. I don't work right now, am suppose to be looking for a job, but I feel so sick most of the time with my Crohn's and the high pulse and weakness, that I don't feel like doing much of anything.

Patients with dehydration or decreased blood volume can have increased heart rate, what with the heart struggling to distribute the decreased volume to every part of the body - it increases its rate.

    "content": "Three weeks ago, I received a mild electric shock from a 120 volt circuit which was barely perceptible in both hands.  I felt no muscle contraction, but a couple hours later, I could feel mild pain (that came and went) in my chest near my heart.  I went to the emergency room and had an EKG.  The ER said I was fine and that the pain should subside.  The pain seemed to go away after a week or so.  I am in otherwise good health and am fairly active.  Since the pain subsided I've done some strenuous hiking, and afterward the mild pain came back and is still there.  I do not have shortness or breath and the pain is not so bad that it keeps me from doing anything, like I said I'm pretty active.  Is this mild pain a common after-effect that will gradually subside or should I get myself to the doctor soon?\n\n",

Your er visit with the ekg being negative ruled out that you have damage detectable on ekg.   i am not sure how long this will go on. The electric current could have injured other muscles in the chest area as well.  If you are exercising without a problem, i doubt that this pain is heart related.  If this pain gets worse, the characters of the pain start to change or it continues for more than you would say is reasonable, let's say 2 more weeks, i would then recommend you visiting your doctor.

    "content": "Dear Brodron,  What made you have an ecg to begin with?   What you said does not mean that you have first degree heart block. Just that you are on the upper end of normal range for something called atrioventricular conduction which conduction of the electrical impulse of the heart from the atria to the ventricles through some sort of a hub called atrioventricular node. This hub normally delays the impulses and it is different for each person and there is a normal range for this condution, it is not a fixed value. You are at that upper end. That's it.  You don't have to worry about this. There is nothing you can take for it.  If you are worried, all you have to do is to get an ecg every year.

    "title": "Re: Tightness in chest",
    "content": "Dear Coyboy,   Determination of whether chest pain is of cardiac origin or not depends on risk factors that the patient has for coronary disease and the characteristics of the chest pain itself.   The risk factors for coronary disease are  1. Family history of coronary disease in young family members.  2. Age. Older people are more prone to heart attacks.  3. Being a male.  4. Hypertension.  5. Diabetes.  6. Smoking. 7.  High choleterol.  8. Sedentary life style.   So, by looking at your profile, you don't have a family history of coronary disease, you don't have hypertension, diabetes, you are young. So, no risk factors there.  You are a male and you smoke.   You never mentioned anything about your cholesterol.  So, when we look at your risk factors, you have 2 risk factors, one that you can not change (being a male) and one that you can (smoking).  About the characteristics of your chest tightness. Pounding usually does not mean pain, usually it means that you can feel your heart beats (usually one can not feel his heart beats). You did not mention where exactly in your chest you feel this pounding/tightness. You mentioned that your hands are numb and that your left arm is hurting you. You have not mentioned how long the pounding lasts, when does this pounding come, what makes it worse, what it makes it go away, do you experience other symptoms with it? Your chest pounding seems atypical for coronary pain.  When someone with only 2 risk factors complains of atypical chest symptoms, then there is low probility that he/she has coronary disease.   Chest pain has many causes. Your chest pain might be related to neck problems as might indicate the symptoms of left arm pain and hand numbness.

I notice the tachycardia more when I get up from a sitting position. If I lie down, it can either be slow or fast. My resting rate is between 80-100 and if I stand up, it goes up sometimes 30bpm. I have been on Narcotic Painkillers for the last couple years for painful prostatitis, and it seems like these symptoms worsen when I discontinue the pain meds. I have not taken the pain meds in about a week. Is it possible pain meds caused this long term? I had none of this until then. Is it possible my heart will re-regulate after a period of time? This is really scaring me and zapping my energy. I had a CAT scan of my lungs and there was no pulmonary embolus and lung x-rays are good? I am at a loss. I am going to a cardiologist again this week. Could I be out of shape? I only weigh 140lbs. I also suffer from acid reflux. Please help!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Tachycardia",
    "content": "Dear Greg,  Your symptoms might be consistent with a condition called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome where the heart rate goes up by 30 or more beats when the patient stands up. It is caused by the inability of the body to compensate with constriction of the blood vessels on standing with heart compensation by increasing the heart rate.  For this to be diagnosed, the patient has to have an absolutely normal heart.   Tachycardia can be caused by many causes, i am sure they talked to you about them when you were hospitalized and i assume that they did all the possible investigations to rule out all the major causes.   This episode could be single, and there is no need to worry about it. But, if it proves to be recurrent, then you might have to be seen by a cardiologist for treatment.  Regarding the pain killers, one of the symptoms of withdrawal is tachycardia. So, you might want to talk to the doctor who prescribed you these medications to make sure that if you want to stop taking those medications, that this is to be done under strict medical supervision.

    "title": "Re:Chest/arm involvement",
    "content": "Dear Moomom,  Chest pain has many causes. One of the most important causes is chest pain of cardiac (heart) origin.  Determination of whether chest pain is of cardiac origin or not depends on risk factors that the patient has for coronary disease and the characteristics of the chest pain itself.   The risk factors for coronary disease are: 1. Family history of coronary disease in family members that started while they are young.  2. Hypertension.  3. Diabetes.  4. Being a male.  5. Age. Older people are more prone to heart attacks.  6. Hyperlipidemia.  7. Smoking.  8. Sedentary life style.   Females in the childbearing age are protected by their natural hormones. You don't have family history, diabetes or hypertension, don't know anything about your cholesterol level and you smoke.  By looking at your risk factors, you have one risk factor smoking.  The characteristics of your chest pain sound to me more atypical than typical of chest pain characteristic of coronary disease.  Your pain sounds more like it is coming of neck problems vs lung problems.   i am not sure about your granuloma is growing and when is the last time you had a ct scan of the chest for follow-up.  i would recommend that you have an x-ray on your neck spine because the symptoms that you are having, pain in the neck and burning and tingling in your left arm sound worriesome for neck spine pathology.  i would also recommend you having a sedimentation rate or c-reactive protein to make sure that your vasculitis is not active and that the pain that you are having is part of the active vasculitis process.

    "content": "Hello, Several types of drugs have been used in patients with vasovagal syncope. These include beta blockers, serotonin uptake inhibitors (i.e., drugs in the Prozac category), florinef (a drug that prevents dehydration by retaining sodium), and midodrine (a drug that tends to limit the dilation of blood vessels). These drugs substantially reduce the episodes of syncope only 60 - 70% of the time, and finding the \"right\" drug treatment is a matter of trial and error. Patience is required on the part of both the doctor and patient.  Florinef is a steroid (a type of cortisone). It has strong mineralocorticoid properties, meaning it can increases the salt and water in the blood.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Vasovagal?!?",
    "content": "Dear Jess,  When you say fainting spells do you mean total loss of consciousness? If yes, what kind of tests did your doctor do to come to the conclusion of this being vasovagal syncope?  How long have you been having these episodes that you called fainting spells and what exactly happens during these spells? Are these spells related to exercise in any way? Would you please elaborate more on these episodes?  In my opinion, syncope in young age has to be investigated to rule out serious causes before labeling it vasovagal.  An echocardiogram has to done to look at the heart muscle (to rule out obstructive cardiomyopathy), at the valves to rule out obstructive lesions (such as mitral or aortic stenosis) and at the pressures to make sure that there is no pulmonary hypertension. ekg (electrical drawing of the heart) and/or holter monitor (24 hours heart monitoring) could be done if deemed necessary if there are symptoms to suggest that the cause of this syncope is arrhythmias.  An eeg (electrical drawing of the brain) has to be done to make sure that there is no seizure activity leading to loss of consciousness if the history is suggestive.  If these come back negative, then a tilt table test is in order to diagnose what type of syncope it is to give the appropriate treatment.

    "content": "Thanks for the quick reply!   Anyways- Ive already been back to my Dr on friday- we tried blood tests (Mono, Blood Chemistry, Anemia, Blood Count, Diabeties- all came back negative) did an echo, EKG, halter (I go back for another one on monday to see if it is tacacardia) and it is rather scary to be in his office and have the guy go \"well right now I'm drawing a blank...\"   There's two things. First the fainting- I'm out for only a few seconds (usually I come to within a few seconds of hitting the ground) They put me on Florinef for that, and thus far it seems to be working.   But the thing is the weakness and shaking. I always seem to be weaker than I use to be. Sometimes i start to shake which is really weird. I think the reason my heart goes crazy on this occurance is because I get scared, but I really don't know.   It was funny on Friday- my doctor was asking me if I could think of any anything that could cause this- we went over every possibility- his only answer- wait. Any suggestions that i could them about?   Thanks so much!   Jess\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jess,  Thank you very much for the update.  Fainting spells or syncope is not an easy entity to investigate because of the many causes that can syncope and the large number of tests involved.  Your doctor did a great job by investigating the cardiac causes of syncope and giving you a medication that so far seems to work for you.  Even though, it seems a remote possibility that seizures could be behind your fainting spells, yet, i would recommend that you be seen by a neurologist to see whether he recommends you having an electroencephalogram (eeg) which is a drawing or recording of the electrical activity of the brain to prove or disprove the presence of seizures because you would not like if this was missed as a reason behind your fainting spells.

    "title": "Constant chest tightness and back pain",
    "content": "I apologize for the length of this message.  My name is Tony and on the morning of Dec. 30, 2003 I had a quick sharp pain in the center of my chest.  After this I had tightness in the center of my chest almost like someone pushing hard into the center of my chest and I became very anxious.  This occurred around 9:00 am.  After dealing with the chest tightness and pressure all day I began to really worry and went to the ER.  I was seen between 7:00 and 8:00 P.M. They did blood work:  complete bld count, thromboplastin, blood urea, creatinine, glucose, electrolyte and CREATINE PHOSPHOKINASE CPK, CREATINE KINASE MB, TROPININ I.   I also had an ekg, and two chest x-rays.  Blood pressure at the time was 118/70.  Everything was normal I was told and the diagnosis of pluerisy was given.  I was told to make an appointment with a cardiologist.  I went to see my new Dr. of Internal Medicine.  I had a resting EKG performed followed by a stress test/ekg.   Both were normal.  I was having symptoms during testing and even had a small panic attack during the stress test. My blood pressure reading at the beginning of my visit was 108/70.  My Dr. said the tests were fine and my exercise tolerance was great.  He didn't feel it was necessary for further testing to rule out heart problems and asked me to come in for a follow up in two weeks. He was confident that it was not heart related because of the tests performed and because the chest tightness and discomfort was constant for a couple weeks straight.  I had a follow up visit with the Dr. two weeks later after my initial visit on Jan. 6.  Between the times of my next visit I continued to lift weights and even use the stair stepper for exercise pretty intensely with no increase in discomfort or other symptoms.  On my two week follow up I explained that I was having anxiety over this.  No further testing or answers to the problem were given until I told him I was really worried that this was heart related.  He mentioned doing a Nuclear Cardiac Sestamibi stress test and told me not to worry but anything was possible (false negative on stress test) and this should clear the air on the heart concern.  I opted to wait a while longer for a few reasons, the costs associated even with my insurance, the hope it was just anxiety and the great fear I have of needles and intravenous catheters.  The dr. told me to continue my prescription of imipramine 50 mgs and xanax 1mg. and see if that helped with the problem.  I had just started ag!  ain after having stopped for about three weeks.  These were prescribed by my neurologist for headaches and anxiety.   I was actually on tofranil pm 100 but had begun to wean myself off prior to beginning again with imipramine.  Because he did not press the issue of further testing and said to try the medication for awhile led me to believe that he might think it was anxiety related.   This is causing great anxiety and panic.  I am now having full blown panic attacks because I think I am going to have a heart attack.  I used to have these with my migraines because I thought they were tumor or aneurysm related.  I have noticed some light aching in my lower teeth and jaw which I have had with migraines before.  I also have sharp pains in my upper back which have been present for a couple weeks too.  These back pains are very noticeable when my wife pushes on my back.  Every little odd feeling causes me great concern.  The chest tightness and pressure may be a little better than it was two weeks ago at times.  Every time I get on the internet it seems I have all the symptoms of a heart attack.   Brief history and symptoms: Chest tightness, pressure and occasional sharp pain under left nipple and in center of chest, anxiety, breathlessness, some jaw discomfort with head pains.  Pain in upper back. Male, 35 years old, married with one four year old son Cholesterol 290 5'8\", 210 lbs. Chest discomfort does not change with exercise or rest. Blood pressure o.k. Father is 58 with controlled high blood pressure and cholesterol. Mother has no health issues. Grandfather had by pass in his late sixties, died in his eighties from cancer. I used to smoke about two packs cigarettes a week for about 6 years.  I have quit for over a year now. Tightness and discomfort are not brought on by exercise or relieved my rest. A little tenderness in my ribs under left arm close to my left nipple I believe is new. I have been severely depressed for sometime and have anxiety problems. Currently being treated for headaches and anxiety with imipramine and xanax. I had been on tofranil pm 100 and occasional xanax for five years which helped relieve my chonic headaches and anxiety.  Recently stopped tofranil before onset of problems. I thought everything was under control. My job is very stressful, I trade stock and options from my home. Some shortness of breath, or I feel like I have to take a deep breath in the middle of sentences but I have been able to do 20 minutes on the stair stepper with no problems.  \u2026\u2026.In March of 2004 I went ahead and asked for a Thallium Nuclear cardiac study from my internist.  He didn\u2019t think it was necessary and he spoke with my cardiologist who did not think anything would show up but agreed to let me do it for piece of mind.  I received the results a few days later and everything was negative and looked fine.  I was very happy.  About a week later all of my symptoms disappeared, the tightness in my chest, the back pain, the tooth pain and my panic attacks.  I resumed my life.  I even started working out again weight training four times a week for about 45 minutes followed by aerobic exercise for another 20 minutes.  This was my routine four days a week with no problems whatsoever.  The stress in my life continued, I am a high stress person and I probably need to learn some coping skills.     This brings me to July of 2004.  I began to feel some tightness in my chest when breathing in again.  This happened around the time I was having a cold or bad allergies.  Not really that bad but I did say to myself I hope this isn\u2019t starting again.  A few days later it progressed to constant tightness and pressure, more pronounced with deep breathing.  I can do the stair climber for a strenuous 20 minutes and get my heart rate really up with out the symptoms really getting worse but last time I tried to jog it seemed the tightness did get worse.  I did get more anxious pushing myself doing some jogging.  I was breathing in and out much harder from the jogging and I don\u2019t know whether the heavy breathing made the symptoms worse or not.  I went to the dr. and I had an asthma test, check up and chest x-ray, all of which were normal.  This constant tightness has been going on now for eight days straight now.  It is definitely worse when I take a deep breath but it is not a pain.  It is a sensation of tightness and pressure.  I have had some aching in my shoulder blades and my upper back too.  It\u2019s as if everything has started all over again.    Well this has been constant now for two weeks.  My Dr. said angina or symptoms of CAD do not last 24 hours a day.  He assured me that after having three to four ekg\u2019s, a stress test, and a thallium nuclear cardiac study, and taking into account all of my symptoms and history that he was very comfortable that this was not heart related at all.  He didn\u2019t think an angiogram was warranted at all when I asked about one and he believed that my cardiologist would not perform one based on my history.  (They work in the same office and correspond on my treatment) He mentioned again that I might want to see a psychiatrist.  I don\u2019t feel like a psychiatrist is necessary.  The symptoms set me off.  I am worried that it is heart related but I don\u2019t understand how I could have had all these symptoms before, have them go away for four months, exercise as hard as I did with no problems and then it starts again and be heart related.  Is it possible?  This new chest tightness and pressure did not come on with exercise.  I do feel like my stress levels as of late are very high.  Is it possible for someone to have chest tightness from stress like someone gets a tension headache?   I am beginning to get anxiety because of this.  What about the upper back pain?  Could the back pain be heart related (angina) or just stress, tension and anxiety?  The part that bothers me so much is the symptom I have are exactly like those described as angina, heart attack or CAD on the internet.  I am also having what feels like muscle cramping in my upper abdomen and when ever I wake up this awful tickle feeling down my throat when I breathe in. Should I be comfortable with the diagnoses I was given, especially with the addition of the negative nuclear cardiac study?  Does any of this sound heart related?  Will taking deep breaths cause more discomfort with heart disease?  Taking a deep breath causes the tightness and pressure to worsen.  Is it possible for angina or CAD, etc to cause chest tightness 24 hours a day for days on end?  This lasted about 9 weeks last time and I a scared to death at this point again.  Should I have more testing?  Thank you in advance for you help.   Tony Bayko\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Constant chest tightness and back pain",
    "content": "Dear Tony,  Determination of whether chest pain is of cardiac origin or not depends on risk factors that the patient has for coronary disease and the characteristics of the chest pain itself.  The risk factors for coronary disease are 1. Family history of coronary disease in young family members.  2. Hypertension.  3. Diabetes.  4. Being a male.  5. Age. Older people are more prone to heart attacks.  6. Hyperlipidemia.  7. Smoking.  8. Sedentary life style.  9. Some drugs can cause heart attacks in young people such as cocaine.   So, by looking at your profile, you don't have a family history of coronary disease, you don't have hypertension, diabetes, you are young and you don't smoke and you don't use any drugs. So, no risk factors there  You are a male. One risk factor. But you have to put in mind that you are less than 50 years of age.  About your lipid profile, your ldl is high but your hdl is high as well, so these two cancel each other out.  So, when we look at your risk factors, you practically don't really have any except may be for being a male. Your risk factors have not changed since last march since you had the negative thallium study.  About the characteristics of your previous and current chest pain, these are absolutely atypical for chest pain of coronary origin. If someone who has chest pain of coronary origin and he/she climbs stairs or walks or does any kind of exercise, most probably he/she would have developped a heart attack and you did not. So, your chest pain is 100% atypical.  When someone without risk factors comes with atypical chest pain, then there is very low probility that he/she has coronary disease.  Your pretest probability was very low to begin with and you had a negative stress test and a negative thallium just a few months back which means that you did not have coronary disease at that time.   Since your risk factors did not change and your chest pain is still atypical, you still don't have coronary disease.  And the real question is what is the cause of the chest pain you are having and how to treat it so that you stop worrying like this.  Chest pain has many causes. Your chest pain might be related to inflammation of the membranes surrounding the lungs and/or the heart leading to increase in the pain when you swallow. Please, if you have not tried yet, go ahead and use an anti-inflammatory like iboprufen and the like.   Another cause could be acid reflux disease especially with the back pain. Try an antacid and see whether it makes any difference in your symtoms.  Another cause which might also cause chest pain is neck spine problems, so i would recommend at this time to take a look at your neck spine with an x-ray to rule this cause out.  If you are breathing too fast and/or coughing a lot, then your muscles will be strained and believe it or not, they can give rise to severe pain.   Other causes include panic attacks and that is why i think your doctor wants to send you for a psychiatric evaluation.

Chest tightness/pressure continues but sometimes I don't notice it.  The back pain around my shoulder blades continues too, aching for minutes at time and I certainly feel like I might have a panic attack because of my symptoms.   My symptoms certainly seem atypical but worrisome none the less.  I guess I need to find out what is really causing these symptoms.  Thank you again.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia in approximately 1987 by one of my family doctor.   He prescribed atenolol.   My blood pressure normally is 90-100/65-70 my pulse was at times 120-135, and taking the atenolol made me extremely tired, I had more palpatations and would get light headed so I weaned myself off.   At that time I asked the dr if this was serious and he told me no, my heart was beating at a normal rhythm, just fast and that the heart is not programmed to just beat so many times and then stop.   I seemed to do okay for quite a few years, and then last year I could feel my pulse was very high again so I saw a different family doctor and was again given atenolol.   After 6 months I weaned myself again because of the same symptoms.     My pulse would rarely go below 100 and I am always very aware of my heart beating - almost like my body pulses with each beat.   Another symptom that has started lately is that it feels like my heart hurts - this is not a severe pain in the middle of my chest, but rather toward the left side.   It can last between a few seconds and several minutes and occurs several times a day.    I am wondering if I should be concerned about this.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Cardiac concern?",
    "content": "Dear jg58,  Sinus tachycardia is the most difficult tachycardia to treat, it usually has lots of reasons including fever, anemia, overactive thyroid, heart failure, among others. The treatment is to treat the cause. Atenolol and the like medicatins are symptomatic treatment for the tachycardia itself but not the actual cause.  If atenolol and the group to which it belongs gives you unwanted side effects, there are medications that can slow the heart rate and they are of different groups and work in different ways.  One of those are a subgroup of the calcium channel blockers group, and an example of this would be a medication called diltiazem. Unfortunately, they can also cause drops in blood pressure.  i am sure that before giving you atenolol, your doctors did some tests to try and find out the cause of this tachycardia, but in case they did not, i would recommend doing a thyroid function test, an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart) and a complete blood count. Some times there are certain medications that cause tachycardia and there are some natural supplements that can cause that as well. So, if you are taking any natural/herbal supplements for any reason, please tell your doctor as well.  To conclude, if this tachycardia does not resolve or does not get under control, i recommend that you see a cardiologist to look further into it as it might not be sinus tachycardia to begin with as there are some rare arrhythmias that look exactly like sinus tachycardia and the only way to diagnose them is by having a test called an electrophysiologic study.

    "title": "Re: Chest pressure",
    "content": "Dear Guest,  Chest pain or pressure can be related to many causes.  The most feared cause is a coronary event or a heart attack. There are risk factors that make the person prone to heart attacks than other people, and thus make it more likely that the chest pain that he/she is getting is related to a coronary event. These factors, in addition to the characteristics of chest pain are the basis of diagnosis of the cause of chest pain. Sometimes it is not as easy as it sounds.  Risk factors include: 1. Family history of early coronary disease.  2. Hypertension.  3. Diabetes.  4. Being a male.  5. Age. Older people are more prone to heart attacks. 6. Hyperlipidemia.  7. Smoking.  8. Sedentary life style.  9. Some drugs can cause heart attacks in young people such as cocaine.  You had a post a while ago saying that you were taking energy pills at one point called herbal nitro but that you stopped taking them because they gave you some undesirable effects. Are you still taking any energy supplements or any other supplements of any kind? Do you smoke? Have you ever checked your blood sugar or your lipid profile? Do you exercise?  You don't have a family history of heart attacks amongst youngsters in your family or at least you did not mention one. You are quite young to have a heart attack, it does not look that you have high blood pressure (although you mentioned that there were some high readings in the past), you don't have diabetes, i am not sure about your smoking history, lipid profile or exercise pattern.  The characteristics of your chest pain does not sound like typical chest pain secondary to coronary disease. There are though more questions to be asked.  You being tired can point to a viral prodrom.  If this continues to be a problem for the next three or four days, i would recommend to see your doctor to have a physical and an ecg and may be some blood tests if your doctor thinks it is necessary.

    "content": "Dear Doctor-  I am not sure whether this question would be more appropriate for a neurologist or not, but here's the problem...  I am a healthy, moderately active 24 yr old woman.  Throughout my adolescence, I would faint often- especially when standing for over 10 minutes, or in hot conditions.  These fainting spells lasted for about 5 years, and had subsided until recently.  (I am uncertain whether the fainting had stopped on its own, or if I had just learned to not stand anymore).  When standing, I start to feel extremely dizzy, and experience a loss of hearing and sight, before fainting.  At these times, I become very clammy, and it feels as though my body cannot expell enough heat- either I become extremely sweaty, or I seem to lose my ability to sweat. Additionally, I have a constant weak feeling, and often experience numbness in my arms and legs.  I become exhausted very easily, and it seems that i have little energy, which surprises me because I am generally pretty fit.  Oftentimes, and this has occurred since childhood and become worse, my legs are extremely restless- when sitting or sleeping, I often have to get up and move my legs around.  It makes me wonder whether this may be a low blood pressure issue.  This has become such a problem that I refrain from standing in almost all situations- I am constantly in search of a chair.  WHAT IS GOING ON????  Please give me your thoughts.\n\n",

    "content": "You may have something known as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). This is clinically defined as a heart rate increase of 30 bpm or more from the supine (laying down) to the standing position within ten minutes or less.  Studies show that most POTS patients are women.        For a correct diagnosis of POTS there must be an absence of any other known cause of tachycardia, such as a specific heart condition.  POTS is usually accompanied by frequent spells of neurally mediated hypotension (NMH), but this is not always the case.  NMH means low blood pressure while standing, caused by a defect in the function of the autonomic nervous system.   To be diagnosed with these conditions you need evaluation by a neurologist. The neurologist will help in the diagnosis of the cause this problem and also to evaluate the numbness in your arms and legs. If indeed you are diagnosed with POTS or NMH then there are many forms of therapy that could help you getting those dizzy spells.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Recently,I began occasionally feeling \"one strong heart beat\"I began feeling these fluttering sensations in my chest which I think are probably palpitations back in April. I went to the doctors and they said there was nothing wrong with my heart, and also that I had asthma. Then for a while, they went away until last week when they came back, along with a few other symptoms including tingling throughout my body. I went to the hospital and they did a blood test and told me my potassium levels were low. Is my low potassium causing my palpitations? They happen when I lay down to sleep, or when I am sitting, when I relieve my bowels, lift something heavy, and once it happend during exercise. What could by causing that one occasional\"strong heart beat\"? Why is this happening to me now, when I haven't changed my diet since I was born? The only lifestyle change I made was last month(after I had the palpitations in April) when I began running a mile every day. However, I stopped doing that since last week. I also feel that whenever I stand up after sitting, my heart is pounding,and I feel short of breath but soon it goes away. My diet is balanced, and I eat a lot of vegetables. Why am I suddenly having these this year, and what can I do if I feel the fluttering sensations? I understand that these are not really harmful, but I really would like it if these stopped. My ECG in April was perfectly fine, I do not take in any caffein, my fat/sugar intake is also very low. Please reply to me ASAP.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kinko,  Low potassium can cause palpitations.  The strong heart beats that you have been feeling are part of the palpitations.   i think that you are feeling your heart beats more because you are just paying more attention to them.  Having palpitations is a common frequent complaint among healthy young adults. To make sure that there is nothing going on, usually, some blood tests are done including a thyroid function test and also an echocardiogram is sometimes done to exclude mitral valve prolapse, a common condition that causes palpitations.  In your case, sometimes, albuterol can cause low potassium and can cause palipitations independent of the low potassium effect.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi There,  I just asking a question, # weeks ago I woke up to get ready for work. About 5:30 that morning I was find but I did some stretches that morning and my heart start to beat fast, I had SOB. I figure it was anxiety. So I tried to relax. Got ready for work, I'm a nurse and I know better but I was in denial that everything would be ok. After I finish getting report from my Coworkers 8:00, I went to get the BP cuff. Went behind the PT curtain My Bp was 90/56 P was 194. My chest was hurting and now my neck at that time my coworkers came in and hooked me to a monitor which it showed ischemic on leads 1 and 2. It was  a  SVT. Went to ER which It converted back. All my labs were normal they DID cardiac marker one time which that was normal. I was in this rhythum for 3 1/2 hours. I did a stress test with myolite and a echo which came back normal. But when I did the stress test They got my heart rate to 156, my blood pressure dropped to 80/60 which my baseline before the test was 120/76 heart rate 56. I was having chest pain , SOB, and neck and jaw pain. They stopped the Test. I got the result from my doctor yesterday which he said it was normal. And that If I get SVT once in awhile it would be ok. I been since 3 weeks since that day OF the ER,   I'm still get SOB when I just walk, I'm taking loppressor, Synthriod, Zoloft and ASA. And still getting mild aches in my chest. Can you tell me if I'm over reacting or get another opinion?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ileon22,  Tachycardia, as you might know, have many causes including but not limited to: 1. Thyroid problems. When was the last time you had a tsh level cheked? Was your synthroid changed recently? 2. Not getting enough sleep. Have you switched to a night shift schedule may be recently? 3. Electrolytes abnormality. i would assume that these were done when you had that er visit and were normal. 4. Smoking. 5. Drinking too much caffeinated beverages, not just coffee. 6. Cardiac ischemia. Even though you had a stress test and a myolite test which came back normal, these are not 100% sensitive and specific. 7. Hypertension. 8. Alcohol. 9. Idiopathic (cause not known).  You never mentioned how was the svt converted in the er, did they give you medications or they had to shock you?  i assume they also did an ekg before they converted the rhythm, did they say what type of svt was it?  It looks that you are still symptomatic, i would suggest that you stop smoking and drinking alcohol and caffeinated beverages if you are. If you are having problems sleeping and you are not getting enough sleep, this has to be dealt with. If after all this, you are still having these episodes, have a tsh level checked if it was not. Have an echocardiogram done to take a look at your heart function and the valves and of course you must find out what type of svt it was.  If everything is normal and you are still having these episodes which from what you are telling me are getting to be uncomfortabel, then i think you ought to be given medications to be able to control these episodes.

    "content": "Ultrasonic sound is a frequency too high to be heard by the human ear (your eardrum can't vibrate fast enough). People can hear sounds ranging from 20 to 20,000 cycles per second, while dogs and cats can hear up to 27,000 cycles per second. The range of other animals can be even higher. When measured electronically, these frequencies are expressed in \"hertz\", defined as a unit equal to one cycle per second. Ultrasonic sound waves are frequencies over 20,000 hertz, or 20 kilohertz (kHz). The PestChaser is designed to continually and automatically sweep an ultrasonic frequency range between 32 and 62 kHz, well above the hearing range of humans and common pets (cats, dogs, birds, fish). Rodents and some other pests can clearly hear these frequencies. At high intensity the sound can induce auditory stress.  In medicine ultrasound is used for diagnostic purposes. As a diagnostic tool ultrasonography has an impressive safety record. However, exposure to continuous ultrasound as in the case of the pest chaser has not been decided. One study back in 1999 showed that cell division changed in the lab when cell cultures were exposed to ultrasound waves. There is no clear cut evidence to date to argue for or against that.   I would recommend in your case, to consult your doctor about your symptoms. If s/he finds that your symptoms are due to another problem. If you take the medicine prescribed by your doctor and still do not feel better then consider turning off the pest chaser.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 40 yr old female with pitting edema in my lower extremeties and an extended stomach. I've seen my doctor for this problem  a year ago and again this week. It just seems to continue to get worse and never goes away.   A year ago I had an EKG was performed which was normal along with blood work. This week she has again run the blood tests to check my liver function, kidney function, thyroid - all of which came back normal. She also checked the protein in my urine, which was also normal.  My doctor gave me 20 mg of Lasix two days ago and I've already lost 9 1/2 lbs. Although my ankles are still pitting. When I press my finger in my ankles, I get about at least a  1/2 inch deep spot, which takes awhile to go back to normal. When I asked \"what now\" when the blood tests came back normal, I was just told to take the Lasix. My doctor does not seemed concerned with my heart function because my blood pressure is  122/64. With my blood pressure being good, does that rule out coronary in relevance to the edema?  I get frequent chest colds and pneumonia, but having allergies and asthma I'm not sure how much of this is related to that.  My father had to have a pacemaker at the age of 41 and has always had very low blood pressure.   Do I have reason to be concerned and continue to ask for follow up, get another opinion or do I just accept this?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 40 yr. old with leg pitting edema, abdominal distention.",
    "content": "Dear Sue,  The causes of leg edema and abdominal distention are various.  Usually, they are related to:  1. Heart failure. 2. Liver failure. 3. Renal failure. 4. Lung failure. 5. Increased pressure in the big veins of the abdomen and pelvis. 6. Very bad nutritional status. 7. Standing on one's feet for several hours a day continuously but this should not give rise to abdominal distention.  Are you sure that the abdominal distention that you have is fluid and not something else?  For each of the above mentioned conditions to cause edema of the legs and abdmoinal distention, has its own characteristics.   1. Heart failure: As for heart failure, before one develops lower limb edema one should have been having symtpoms suggestive of heart failure like shortness of breath. i would suggest that you have your heart evaluated by an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) unless your doctor abosolutely thinks that this is not related to the heart. A normal blood pressure does not mean that heart failure could be ruled out. As for coronary disease to cause lower limb edema and abdominal distention it has to affect the heart muscle first and cause heart failure.  2. Liver failure: As for liver, for the lower limb edema to appear and the abdominal distention to appear, one should have full blown picture of liver failure and obviously you don't.  3. Renal failure: As for the kidneys, even though you don't have much proteins in the urine on a urinalysis, i would suggest to get a 24 hours urine collection which should be more accurate. Since your kidney functions turned out to be ok, i would think that this might be normal although there are disease entities that can cause high proteins in the urine with normal kidney functions. i would also suggest to have a kidey ultrasound.  4. Lung failure: As for lungs, one might have a history of may be smoking, asthma, emphesyma or have a history of pulmonary hypertension whatever its cause might be. If you are having syptoms suggestive of any of these diseases, i would suggest that you have a lung function test.  5. Increased pressure in the big veins of the abdomen and pelvis: This could be related to a either a blood clot in the big veins of the of the abdomen or related to something like a an abnormal growth pressing on those veins.  6. Very bad nutritional status:  With low protein in the blood. This is obviosuly not the case as proteins in the blood are usually measured with the liver function tests and yours were normal as you mentioned.  7. Standing on one's feet for several hours a day continuously: But this should not give rise to abdominal distention.  Lasix, or diuretics in general, are symptomatic treatment, they don't treat the underlying cause just the edema itself. This being said, however, it is the corner stay of treatment for edema whatever its cause but they have to be used cautiously as they have their own side effects and patients have to be under medical supervision and close follow-up.  Other modalities of treatment that you might want to try although not preferred by many patients is to wear a compression stocking in the morning before getting out of bed and of course after you make sure that you don't have any edema in your legs but this obviously will not affect your abdominal distention and does not address the underlying cause.  As you see, it is not easy to know what is the cause of the edema exactly and also, it is not cheap as i mentioned lots of tests that might be expensive. You can talk to your doctor and let him explain to you what he thinks the cause of the edema is and why does not want to pursue further investigations.   In my opinion, if this has been getting worse, i would suggest to try and find the underlying cause so that you may be given the appropriate treatment for the cause of the edema if any, this in addition to the diuretics of course.

It's hard to separate some of the symptoms, because I have asthma so I do become very SOB easily and have had a allergic reaction to a medication that caused lung scarring, a 13 year history of bladder/kidney infections, and a family history of coronary problems.  This morning I had something new happen though. I get up at 4am and usually the restroom is the first place I go, but not this morning. I could not urinate until after I had taken my Lasix at 6am. After 3 cups of coffee, 14 oz. orange juice, 2 diet cokes, 3 20oz bottles of water, I've only urinated a total of 3 times all day.  I've also been noticing my heart beat very strong and rapid at time. This has only happened a couple of times in the past week. The lasix is only a minimal help with the edema. The pitting has never gone away  Thanks again for your reply. Now at least I know what I can ask about with my doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sue,  Thank you very much for the update.  Lung scarring on the long run can cause what is known as pulmonary hypertension and this can lead to right sided heart failure with the subsequent development of lower limb edema and abdominal distention secondary to fluid collection in the abdomen.  Taking too much lasix can lead to dehydration and dehydration can lead to low urine output. Feeling strong and rapid heart beats can be related to lasix intake as well as lasix may lead to depletion of potassium in the body which in turn can lead to this symptom.  Please, notify your doctor about these symptoms and have a blood work done to check your renal functions and your potassium level in the blood if your doctor deems it necessary.  Keep me updated.

    "title": "Ectopic beats",
    "content": "I experienced symptoms about a year ago which caused me great anxiety. I had pain in my chest , in my left arm , in my jaw and in my back. These symptoms were usually when i was  at rest. The symptoms presented themselves for weeks at a time and then would go away. I spoke to my GP and he said it was either muscular pain or anxiety attacks.  Recently I have experienced new symptoms.It is difficult to describe - my heart ryhthm feels irregular. I can feel it in my chest , almost like a pause and then a sudden thud back to regular rhythm. I know that Ectopic beats are common and I have experienced them in the past, this is what I thought the symptoms may be , but they are more regular and noticable , I can feel a clear pause whn I feel my pulse that is in time with the feeling in my chest. I would visit my GP but the response I have had in the past is - \" don't worry about it , your only young and being stupid\" - all this advice without feeling my pulse or BP etc. Does anyone have any idea what could be the cause of these symptoms? Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Ectopic beats",
    "content": "Dear ak_uk76,  What you are experiencing is ectopic beats exactly like you described them and the reason that there is a pause that you felt is that the ectopic beat comes earlier than the regular beat and so, if you are paying attention to your pulse and heart, you would feel like there is a pause, when actually the normal beat comes on time following some types of ectopic beats and just a little bit later than normal in other types.  Ectopic beats were found in normal people who did not even felt that they had them.  Even though there are causes of ectopic beats and they are various and they include: 1. Drinking too much caffeinated beverages. 2. Drinking alcohol. 3. Smoking cigarettes. 4. Exhaution. 5. Not getting enough sleep. 6. Abnormal electrolytes in the blood. 7. Having a hyperactive thyroid gland. 8. A condition called mitral valve prolapse.  If these ectopic beats are not causing you any problems, i would suggest that you try and not pay much attention to them. If you are really worried, you can have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) done to rule out mitral valve prolapse and blood tests done to see whether the electrolytes in your blood are normal or not and check a thyroid function test.   Of course this is not enough, you have to stop smoking, drinking coffee and alcohol and get enough rest for a good amount of time to see whether this will make a difference in your symptoms.   If all investigations come back normal and after you stopped all things that can cause ectopic beats, you are still complaining of those ectopic beats some would argue putting you on a 24 hours (or even more) cardiac monitor to see what kind of ectopic beats they are and treat accordingly and others will tell you that you don't need treatment as they are not causing any harm and try to get used to them and get on with your life.

    "title": "Cyanosis...lung problems",
    "content": "Lately, I've noticed that my lips turn blue, and not just when it's close to my menses.  Sometimes, they turn particularly bright blue after I work-out, though working out makes me feel good.   On Sunday night, I drank about 5 low carb beers, and Monday morning, I woke-up and felt fine as long as I lay in bed...no headache.  Zip.   However, everytime I exerted myself even slightly, tachycardia started, and I developed a cold sweat.   When I walked to my car, I felt light-headed, and I began to have some vague, subjective tingling and numbness on the left side of my body.     I did have some diarrhea...just one episode, and some faint vaginal bleeding, post-menstrual, which has become common since I turned 40 something.   I got to work and felt when I'd stand, as if I was moving through jello.   However, a client called-up, and I popped some peptobismol, and I was at 99% within minutes, yet, I'd had nothing to eat and something tells me this might be psychosomatic, or, partially so, but in no way was it indigestion.     Took yesterday off, and felt pretty good...  Went to work; news of lay-offs, and hectic, hectic, and it's a non-profit, and the boss won't let me work late, though I could be disbarred if I don't get my work done.     Five o'clock came, and this time no sweating or racing pulse, but a pain, mid-chest, and then dizziness, with numbness and tingling left side of the body, but when I left, all abated.   Now, I'm not dumb...I know that I should see a doctor, but how likely is this a stroke...I'm not anemic...I'm a vegetarian...I exercise regularly...I have really low blood pressure...110/65-70, when I'm not angry...all the good cholesterol, and none of the bad...  One other thing I've noticed lately, though, is that spicy food makes me cough, and my chronic little rattle in my lungs gets worse, and, one day, last week, after I had an extra spicy meal, the cyanosis on my lips got funky looking.   I know...see a doctor, but does it sound likely it's cardiac?   With my low weight (120; 5'3\"), hct: 14.2; low bp (110/65), and lifestyle, drink some, vegetarian, single...easygoing, but high stress job.     Also, there was an irregular syph. test, which was a false positive some years ago, and the dr. said to watc for signs of lupus, but I'm healthy...work with AIDS patients, and I never have a sick day.   Some reaction to aspirin, with cross-reactions to ibuprofen taken on an empty stomach.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ria,  Hope you are feeling fine now.  i don't think that what you are complaining of is related to the heart.  Some of the symptoms that you have like the tingling on the left side of your body might be related to a stroke, this being said however, strokes usually occur in elderly people, you are still young for strokes (this does not mean that strokes don't occur in people your age, they do  but it is very rare).  i can not really be sure what was the cause of your symptoms and may be was related to your drinking overnight.  About the cyanosis of the lips, it is usually secondary to vasoconstriction of the blood vessels of the lips which is most of the time secondary to cold weather.

    "title": "Concerned about Constant Chest pain",
    "content": "Hi.  I am concerned about some constant chestpain I have had now for almost 2 weeks. It occurs right between my breasts.  It is a dull pain, with a pressure like quality.  It doesn't get worse when I take a deep breath(though I do feel it more), but it does get worse if I speed up when walking or when I carry things. The pain does not go away with rest however.  It is a constant pain.  There has been one or two days of the past two weeks when I have not felt the pain.  But it is usually always there even when sleeping.  For the past 2 days I have felt dull ache as well in my back- but I think the back pain  might be due to the worry I have over this chest pain(tightening of my muscles).  The chest pain started with the onset of a medication I started  taking.  I I think it might be due to that.  The medication is pindelol.  I have not stopped the meds though because my doctor warned me that a side effect of it could be chest pain.    I am just wondering how you make a distinction between chest pain as a side effect(and harmless), and chest pain that might be potentially dangerous.  How serious does mine sound?    I am 37 years old.  I have no 'bad' habits.  I neither drink nor smoke.  I also have no health problems except high cholesterol.  My mother however does have some sort of heart problem(though I do not know any details about it).     Thank you for any guidance you can provide.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Diane,  i hope you are feeling better now.  Why did you start taking pindolol? Is it for high blood pressure or  palpitations.  Pindolol is a beta blocker and all beta blockers have the potential to give a fatigue sensation and some muscle aches.  Your chest pain does not sound like chest pain of coronary disease characteristics.  If the chest coincided with the start of this medication and it is really giving you hard time, i would suggest that you talk to your doctor about switching you to another medication for the same purpose.

    "content": "Hello,  I am a healthy, active and alert 84 yr old, white male. I have high blood pressure which is under control w/ a prescription.   And I take a water pill for swollen ankles.   Occassioanlly, for 20 years I have a \"weak spell\" but I have never passed out. In the last 2 years, these spells have become stronger and I feel that I may pass out if I don't sit down.   I have gone to the local ER and they run all the usual tests, including several overnight observations and they find nothing wrong. Such as :heart cath (scope), mys____ (new type of full heart xray/nuke stress?),traditional stress tests, portable monitor for 24-48 hrs, etc.   The other morning, I was shaving and my arms & shoulders suddenly felt extremely weak and numb, like they fell asleep--NO heart/chest pain. At that moment, I went to lay down for awhile. My dr. told me to go to the ER. Once again, 1 overnight visit w/ no answers.   Do you have any suggestions? Maybe a 2nd opinion at a major university hospital like U of Michigan or Mayo Clinic?   Would it be more help if I told you all my prescriptions and exact tests?   Would greatly appreciate any more info.  Thanks Alot,   Michigan\n\n",

I know that I have carple tunnle syndrom and raynauds , but I notice when these attacks happen, where the effects of the carple tunnle syndrom usually occur, my hand/arm begins to tingle a little\u2026. I also feel a little tightness/ache in my chest while this is occurring \u2026  My mother is a diabetic and has extremely high blood pressure\u2026.and my father just had a bypass (his sugar and blood pressure are just fine, however he has high cholesterol) .    After eating a piece of cake the other day within 20 minutes I tested my blood sugar and it was 85\u2026  my blood pressure always runs between 117/120 over 68/80   so everything seems to be fine as far as my sugar and blood pressure.

These risk factors include family history of premature coronary disease, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, sedentary life style and obesity.  You did not mention who on your mother's side of the family has heart disease and what kind of heart disease they had but you mentioned that no one had a heart problem when still young. You do not smoke. You have not mentioned anything about whether you excercise regularly and how much do you weigh.   Chest pain caused by heart disease usually has certain characteritics. The coronary pain is usually a sharp pain, but can be perceived by patients as pressure, burning or stabbing sensation. It usually occurs on exertion, lasts for a few minutes and is relieved by rest. Its location is usually behind the breast bone and can move to other places like the left arm, the back or the neck. If severe enough it can be associated with nausea, vomiting and sweating, but these symptoms are so non-specific and they are not an indication that the pain is of coronary disease but just the pain might be severe.   The answer to all these questions makes it most of the time easy on the physician to decide the origin of the chest pain and whether it is cardiac in origin or not (from the heart).   You being a female, at your age, a non-smoker, no heart disease history in the family at a young age and not having high blood pressure nor diabetes in addition to your chest pain characteristics not sounding typical of coronary disease and a normal ekg make it very highly unlikely that your chest pain is of heart origin.  Having pain under the arm pits at the same time makes it a possibility that you might be suffering from a nerve problem like shingles which is a nerve infection that is manifested by a rash and pain (have you ever had a skin rash at this area before), sometimes even, there is no rash. After the rash is gone (or if there was no rash), sometimes this is followed by chronic pain in the area where there was a rach, a condition known as postherpetic neuralgia and the treatment is medications that affect the nerves. Also, this could be a problem with the nerves of the spinal cord especially the neck and upper spine. So, i would suggest to have an x-ray of the neck and thorax spine.  Costchondritis can be a cause of this ongoing chest pain.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "For the last 6 weeks I have been having some frequent fluttering in my chest.  I have had my family doctor run some tests, but nothing shows. EKG showed normal activity.  Blood tests for kidney, liver, thyroid, red/white count normal.  Blood pressure normal.  I have a neurology consult scheduled in June, but I just feel strange waiting that long for something when I know something is wrong inside now!   What happens: It feels like palpitations.  It feels like a pause and then brief race to catch up.  During the brief episodes (only as long as 1 or maybe 2 beats), I feel a somewhat numb sensation into my extremeties.  It's not a tingle, but just a 'sensation.'  During quiet, I can feel/hear what almost sounds like the squeezing of a wet sponge in my head.  The strange part is that many times I can cause one of these episodes to occur by quickly shifting my vision to something else, such as looking at the computer then looking up at the clock.  May or may not be related: I have had a pain in the neck which can generally be relieved temporarily by 'popping,' altho not always.  I have been to the chiropractor in the past, but not in the past 6 months. My vision 'jumps.'  While shaving with an electric razor or sitting on a vibrating chair, items with strong contrast, like TV or digital clock, seem to vibrate with it.  I also get this sensation if I'm looking at something like that while walking across the room. My grandmother just passed away from cancer, reopening much hurt from when my mother died of the same in 1997.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jeff,  What you are experiencing is most probably extra-beats.  These are usually benign in nature unless you have an underlying heart disease.  i would suggest that you stop drinking alcohol, coffee, chocolate or any other caffeinated beverages like pop. If you smoke, please, stop if you can.  i would have wanted to see electrolytes results like sodium, potassium and magnesium on the list of the blood tests that were done.   If those continue to be a problem, i would suggest having an ultrasound of the heart (known as echocardiogram) to rule out the presence of a condition known as mitral valve prolapse, a condition known to cause palpitations in healthy young adults.  About the sensation of vibration of the surroundings, this could be a normal response to the activity that you are doing at that time.

    "title": "Teenager With Exercise Induced Chest Pain",
    "content": "My 14 year old daughter has these episodes when she runs or when she has been hit or something (more emotionally triggered) during practice.  When these occur she says her chest hurts like it is being squeezed, sweaty, pale, lethargic, fairly unresponsive (to your voice), her eyes roll as if she is about to pass out. These pass in about 5 to 10 minutes when she is back to being more responsive, etc. At one time she passed out trying to run around the school during practice.  The PCP said it was probably exercise induced asthma and from the beginning had given her an inhaler to use before activity and during an episode.  While at a competition she had a really bad episode after she and a few team mates fell trying to catch a girl during competition, chest began to hurt finally full blown episode, chest pain, extremely pale and sweaty, eyes when back and she was unresponsive, half way carrying her outside the paramedics caught us and began to check her out after a few minutes they checked her breathing because we discussed asthma they said her breathing sounded great, but more concerned that she had been unresponsive and her heart was beating way to fast.  After about 5 more minutes she was responsive again and heart was slowing down.  As usually she's much better just fatigued after these maybe acts a little confused for abit.  The PCP now does think she has asthma but doesn't think any needs to be addressed anymore because it's probably muscoskeletal.   The school and the cheer gym still refuse to run her because they feel it's not right and want no responsibility, they just have her walk or do stationary bike.  FYI... She is also being treated by the PCP and the Pediatric Orthopedic for wrist pain in both wrist.. tenditis.   We have been battling this for about 8 months, we take 4 to 8 weeks off from tumbling or cheer, did physical therapy, and some days still have swelling and pain.  She returns to cheer and tumbling and we end back up at the beginning.  At one point we had both wrist, knees, and ankles with pain and swelling while we were not cheering or tumbling.  We now are down to the wrist again.  She has had a low grade fever (99 - 100)  for 6 to 8 months also and seems increasingly fatigued and just a general feeling of not feeling well.  She had blood work tested for arthritis and lupus and both came back OK.  MRI on left wrist showed tenditis but no joint damage.  I know this is a lot of information, but I tried to give an overall discription just encase it could all be related.  Any guidance at this point would be greatly appreciated about the chest pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kay,  Even though your description is not typical to that of the sudden syncope (loss of consciousness) that happens to people  who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy when they exercise, i would strongly urge you to have your daughter checked for this condition by doing an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart).  If you want to know whether your daughter has asthma or not, there is a test called the methacholine challenge test which can have to see whether she has asthma.  Regarding the fast heart rate that your daughter was told to be experiencing while she is not responsive, i would suugest to have a Holter Monitor (24 hours heart monitor) and let her exercise and see what kind of fast rhythm does she go into.

    "title": "Heart feels like its beating out of my throat",
    "content": "Hi there, I'm a 25 year old male, 6'0\", 175lbs., I keep myself in good shape and although I've got mild asthma, puffers aren't necessary.  When I was around 21 or so, I experienced some strange heart symptoms that suddenly came out of nowhere.  These included skipping beats, rapid beating while at rest, and hard pounding beats while trying to sleep.  I went to my family doctor and had all the tests done (EKG, Holter, blood tests, and an echocardiogram) only to find out that all results came back negative and my heart was completely healthy.  I even saw a heart specialist, who also told me everything was 100% perfect and I had nothing to worry about.  Shortly thereafter, all symptoms stopped.  I assumed it was something I grew out of, or some kind of temporary minor short-circuiting, and continued on with life thinking nothing more of it.  Jump to a few years later, at the end of December 2003.  A couple days before New Year's, I'm at my girlfriend's house and we're sitting watching a movie when her cat (a mean old thing who wants to kill everyone!) jumps on my lap and tries to attack me.  This took me by total surprise and half scared me to death, at which point my heart starts freaking out and rapidly beating.  I was getting all light-headed and sick to my stomach so I went for a walk outside.  After that day, all of my previous symptoms returned.   I went back to my family doctor and had the tests done again, minus the echo because the doctor said it wasn't necessary to have one again.  Once more, all results were negative and I was told not to worry and everything was perfect.  Actually this time my doctor gave me some kind of explanation that perhaps my hormones and/or chemicals dealing with adrenaline get out of whack from time to time and cause my heart palps.  But I was reassured that there's nothing wrong and that I don't need to worry.  But now on top of that, every night when I go to bed, I can hear my heart pounding through my ears and the blood rushing through them, something that has only started happening since the new year.  This is very unnerving as I can hear if my heart skips or starts beating fast, thus getting me all paranoid and unable to sleep which is no good when I have to get up early every morning. It's been a little more than 4 months since my symptoms came back, they haven't really gone away and every time I think they have, they resurface.  I quit smoking when I first experienced them in December hoping it would help, but it hasn't.  The only pop I really drink is Sprite, I don't drink coffee, but I have 3-4 cups of tea each day.  I'll maybe have fast food once a week.  I'm afraid to work out, get excited or stressed, watch a movie or have sex with my girlfriend because almost every time it causes an episode.  Sometimes if I run up the stairs too fast, my heart feels like its beating out of my throat, which is ridiculous as its only a few stairs.  This isn't right, especially at my age, that I can't do what I want.  I don't know what to do, but I'm really fed up with this happening, and each time I get scared and fear I'll have a heart attack or something and die.  I don't know how I'm supposed to deal with this for the rest of my life.  There has to be SOMETHING I can do to at least reduce or tame these heart symptoms.  Can anyone help?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ryo,  If your doctor did not check a thyroid test i would advice you to have one.  Regarding your echo results, did you have an absolutely normal heart? Not even mitral valve prolapse?   Whatever you are having is most probably bening and there is nothing to worry about since you have a normal heart and all the blood tests are normal and the symptoms are improving.  Personally, i would advice you to wait and not take any medications and make sure not to worry as whenever you are trying to see whether you have palpitations or not you will become aware of your heart beats and you will start feeling your heart beats whether normal or abnormal and this in itself is very annoying (like hearing your heart beats through your ears at night). It is normal that your heart beats and you are not supposed to feel it unless there is something abnormal about it. But if you concentrate enough and espcially in the right set of mind, you will definitely hear it even if normal.  So, to make a long story short, forget about these symptoms and enjoy your life as most probably there is nothing to it.

If you can check your blood sugar during the attack and see what it is, this would be great. If you also could check a complete blood count to see your hemoglobin make sure you don't have anemia.  The dizziness that you are mentioning is not the typical for an inner ear problem but nonetheless, you may have an inner ear problem if you have just been through an upper airway infection.

When running it seems to slow down, because I concentrate on exhaling for 2 steps and inhaling for 2 steps (prevents muscle cramps).

    "content": "Hello.  I am on Spring Break in Panama City Beach, FL.  I have not consumed any alcohol or anything of the sort.  This afternoon, I went in a heated pool for about 20 minutes.  I then sat in a hot tub for about 20 minutes.  The outside temperature was low 60s, which is cold to me, being from South Florida (PCB is in North Florida).  Immediately after getting out of the hot tub, I felt nauseous and had a few dry heaves but did not vomit.  I then decided to go up to my room to lay down.  In the elevator, I got very dizzy and my vision started blurring.  I then fell down and dropped my towel and room key....somehow, I managed to crawl out onto my floor even though at this point I had almost no eyesight.  A group of housekeeping staff saw me and helped me up.  They said that my lips were solid blue.  At this point, I had zero vision and all I saw was total blackness with gold swirlies.  My body felt very heavy and I needed their help to walk.  They helped me walk to my room and at the door, my vision slowly began returning and when I sat down, I felt much better.  I still have a slight headache.  Help is much appreciated....\n\n",

We visited the ER on 2/23..where some routine blood work along with an EKG were performed.  These seemed to be alright according to the doctor on duty.  We then saw a family doctor on 2/25.  He ordered a treadmill test that Friday.  All seemed to be well....however, here are the symptons that continue daily.  He has chest pains daily...along with numbness, pain, and/or tingling in the left arm.  He has pain in his jaw and neck.  Over the past two days he has developed really bad headaches along with blurred vision in his left eye.  He is a workaholic who normally pushes hard for 12-14 hrs daily on a farm and well drilling.  He hasn't had the energy to do anything this past week.  He has been referred to a cardiologist almost 2wks from now.  My question is what do you think this is  and should he see a doctor sooner?  Thanks so much for your help.  We are in a really small town and they seem to be taking his chest pains and other symptoms lightly.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Scwoods,  Thank you very much for using our website.  If your husband completed the stress test till the point where he was supposed to, most probably his chest pains are not related to coronary disease. Did he have any chest pains during the stress test? Where there any ekg changes then?   This being said, however, there is still a small chance that he has coronary disease. However, it is highly unlikely that he has coronary disease, as the character of pain that you are describing is atypical for coronary disease as he went to the emergency room and while having the pain and his ekg was normal as well as his blood work. Also, it is kind of unusual to have chest pain related to coronary disease untreated for 2 weeks without developing a heart attack.  The cause of the chest pains of your husband could be related to neck spine problems as it could lead to the symptoms you are describing of neck pain and left arm pain as well as chest pains.  Other causes could be a  1. Inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart called the pericardium (pericarditis). 2. Inflammation of the membrane surrounding the lung (pleurisy). 3. Bad cold with lots of muscle pain. 4. Exhaution from working too muck. 5. Acid reflux disease.  My advice is for your husband to have a little bit of a rest from work in addition to trying to take anti-inflammatory medications to see whether is giong to help the pain and to have an x-ray of his neck spine. If after all this he still has the pain and both of you are still worried, then, i think it would not be unreasonable to see a cardiologist.

The other night I had a panic attack and my heart beart was 150 bpm just sitting down so I rushed myself to the emergency room. They monitored me for 4 hours and did 2 EKG's both of which were normal and did a blood test to make sure I didn't have a blood clot in my lung which would cause the high pulse rate. It took four hours of my lying down until it went down below 100 bpm and then they released me. I also get a chest pain on the left side on my breast bone between my breasts and pain in my left armpit sometimes. The problem is my heart rate jumps like that all the time and then it causes me to have a panic attack because the fast beating makes me think I am having a heart attack. Do you think this is just anxiety or do I need to seek a cardio work up?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr.  Every day for the past year or so I have been taking routine walks both in the morning for 40 minuets and in the evening for 40 minuets.  Around 6 months ago I started to feel a sensation of heat in my head, like I felt flushed. This stopped eventually , however , right now when I walk I feel a heavyness in my chest , a sort of squeezing pain directly in the centre of my chest.  This pain is also felt in my throat. After a short period of rest I feel no pain atall but even just doing the snow shoveling for 2 minuets makes it return.   I am a heavy smoker ( 30 cigarettes per day ) , and heavy drinker ( around 6 doubles of a 25% alchohol beverage ) in the evening only.   This pain seems to have come on at around the time it got very cold in the area I live. I am to understand that going from a hot environment like my living room , to an environment below freezing suddenly , will cause your heart to race. Could this be affecting the pain? The reason I ask this is because after around 35 minuets the pain seems to vanish or lessen whilst still walking. Could it just be my body's shock at the temperature change?    Thank you very much in advance for any advice you can give.  -rob\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Rob,  Thank you very much for using our website.  The pain that you are describing has some of the typical charateristic of pain of heart origin.  Getting the pain during exercise, having it in the center of your chest and feeling it in your throat, pain being squeezing in nature and the pain giong away after a short period of rest.  The thing strongly against the pain being of cardiac origin is the pain vanishing 35 minutes into walking.  You have certain risk factors for coronary disease. Being a male, smoking and drinking.   The most important factor though is having a positive family history for coronary disease and you have not mentionned whether or not you have a positive family history for coronary disease (a first degree male relative who had a heart attack before age 50 and/or a first degree female relative who had a heart attack before age 60).  Is the pain that you are having of heart origin, the answer to this is difficult and it can be yes and can be no.  Personally, i am inclined not to consider it of cardiac origin as you are young, have been exercising for almost a year now (why did you start to have pain now and if you had coronary disease it would have manifested itself a year ago when you started exercising, unless something came on which i don't believe is the case). And most importantly since the pain disappears when you are 35 minutes into walking (which wouldn't be the case if the pain was of heart origin).  So, what is causing this pain? My guess is that when you start breathing the cold air, i think you start having some sort of airway hyperactivity (like asthma) but not to a significant extent that makes you feel real short of breath but just enough to make you feel some chest tightness which is a common symptom in asthma secondary to inability to breath (as many patients will describe their shortness of breath as chest tightness).  This being said, however, i think it is worth your while to be checked  by a doctor to make sure that the pain is not of heart origin as i said in the begining, it is difficult to say whether the pain is of cardiac origin or not as you have some risk factors and the pain has some features typical of heart pain.  The way to go most probably is by having an ecg treadmill stress test. If this is negative and you still have the same sensation each time you go out in the cold air then you ought to have a test to see whether you have asthma or not (called a methacholine challenge test). Or begin with the asthma test and then if negative go for the stress test whichever your doctor thinks is more convenient.  One more thing, although it is a remote possibility, is that you have coronary artery spasm due to the severe cold but this is usually associated with severe pain exactly as if you are having a heart attack and usually resolves with medications or if the cause of the spasm (in your case the cold) is gone, which does not happen in your case (you continue to walk in the cold but the pain improves).

After making this post , a few days later , I dicovered a spilt bleach container in this room where I spend 8 hours of my day. The doctor concluded that the bleach , mixing with kerosene fumes , was causing these chest discomforts. I had 2 x-rays done ( front and side ) and after a quick examination of these xrays the doctor confirmed that there was indeed nothign wrong with me.  He suggested that my high blood preassure ( 164 / 100 at the time of examination ) was caused by my constant worry and constant reading of online medical journals. I would literally have nothing else on my mind but what \"could\" be wrong with me ALL DAY.  So ..

    "title": "Re: Chest pains",
    "content": "Dear Jimswife,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Chest pain is usually worrisome for coronary disease. Coronary disease has factors the presence/absence of which can usually predict fairly well the probability of the person complaining of chest pain having or not having coronary disease.   These risk factors include family history, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, sedentary life style and obesity. You did not mention if your mother ever had a heart attack (and if yes how old was she then), whether you smoke or not, whether you excercise regularly and how much do you weigh. You mentionned that you are a diabetic and you had cancer history but you never said what kind of cancer.  Chest pain caused by heart disease usually has certain characteritics. The coronary pain is usually a sharp pain, but can be perceived by patients as pressure, burning or stabbing sensation. It usually occurs on exertion, lasts for a few minutes and is relieved by rest. Its location is usually behind the breast bone and can move to other places like the left arm, the back or the neck. If severe enough it can be associated with nausea, vomiting and sweating, but these symptoms are so non-specific and they are not an indication that the pain is of coronary disease but just the pain might be severe.   The answer to all these questions makes it most of the time easy on the physician to decide the origin of the chest pain and whether it is cardiac in origin or not (from the heart).   Obviously if the only source of chest pain was the heart, it would have been very easy for doctors to diagnose all patients who present with chest pain, but there are other sources and the symptoms are sometimes vague enough so that doctors resort to other resources to try to diagnose the source of the pain.   Your visit to the emergency department was a good step but i am not sure what is the enzyme that was high and then came down.  You had a negative stress test and your doctor went even a good step further with the nuclear stress test. How were these tests done? Were they treadmill stress test or a chemical test and if on the treadmill how long did you last and why they stopped the test?  While awaiting the results of the nuclear stress test. If the lymph nodes that you have turn out to be of cancerous origin and you need a major surgery, most probably your surgeon will not be satisfied with all this (chest pain in a diabetic patient and needs a major surgery) and he will ask you to see a cardiologist or be formally evaluated by a cardiologist who might or might not you to have a coronary angiogram which is a specialized type of x-ray where a dye is injected directly into the coronaries under x-ray vision to see whether the coronaries are diseased and if yes how much and whether or not surgery is needed.  These minor chest pains also can be caused by spread of the cancer to the sac surrounding the heart although it does not sound like it, but it would not be unreasonable to have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to make sure that there is no fluid collection around the heart.

    "title": "Re: Heart rate and pulse",
    "content": "Dear kkulp,  Thank you very much for using our website.  How was this found out? Was he on a monitor and his pulse being taken at the same time?  If he has a pacer and the pacer is working all the time, this should not be the case if the pacer is working 100% of the time (meaning that the heart itself is not generating any beats and is 100% dependant on the pacer for generation of the beats). If this is the case (100% dependant heart) and his heart rate (that you think the pacer is set to) is faster than the pulse, the pacer should be checked as it could mean that the pacer is not working 100% of the time.  Other causes of heart rate being faster than the pulse are conditions in which the heart generates electrical beats but not all of which are \"transfromed\" into mechanical beats that are perceived (by persons) as pulse. These include a condition called atrial fibrillation and \"extra beats\". But, these conditions are usually discovered by simultaneous monitoring of the heart rate and the pulse so that you can find out that there is a discrepancy between both the heart rate and the pulse. So, i am not really sure how your mother's better half was able to figure this out, unless was discovered by his doctor or unless he felt that he had an abnormal heart rhythm or irregular fast heart rate and as he was checking his pulse, the number of heart beats that he felt were more than the pulse that he was checking at the same time (or may be he thought this was the case).

Do you have any other accompanying symptoms? What happens if you don't raise your left arm? Do you smoke? Do you drink alchohol, lots of coffee, lots of tea? What is your medical background? Do you take any medications on regular basis? Does this happen when you turn to your left side as well?  Palpitations (feeling that one's heart is beating) have many reasons and the answer to some of the above questions might helo point the reason behind what you are complaining of.

I have noticed the symptoms  at other times when I change body position.  If I don't raise the arm the symptoms continue for the entire 30 seconds.  Raising the arm stops the symptoms.  I don't smoke or drink and exercise regularly.  I am not overweight.  I don't drink coffee or tea.  I have not had any medical problems in the past.

    "content": "Dear RJ,  Thank you very much for the update.  i can not think of anything that can cause this.   If it is really bothering you and it happens on regular basis, you can ask your doctor to have a holter monitor (a device that records heart beats for 24 hours) done and the rhythm analysed and this way, your doctor can exactly know what kind of rhythm you have.  Either way the only way to exclude anything serious would be to be examined by a cardiologist.

    "title": "Re: Epigastic bruit",
    "content": "Dear vze3qdxk,  Thank you very much for using our website.  A bruit is a sound that is heard on a blood vessel secondary to turbulence of flow in that vessel. The presence of the bruit in itself does not necessarily mean that there is a blocked vessel.  The epigastric region contains lots of blood vessels including the major blood vessel of the body the aorta and many of the major vessels of the body going to the liver, stomach, pancreas and intestines.  The bruit that you have could originate from any of those blood vessels.  But since you developed new onset hypertension and your doctor heard this bruit, the assumption was that the bruit was from your renal arteries. Since you had a normal renal arteriogram, this means that you do not have renal artery stenosis but does it mean that the bruit is not coming from the renal artery? Once more, not necessarily.  This bruit just means turbulance of blood in some blood vessel. It would be very unpractical if we go around trying to find the source of the bruit doing angiograms or dopplers or other investigations since you are currently asymptomatic and you had the renal arteriogram (since you had hypertension) that was normal. Otherwise, i would suggest that you follow up with your doctor and if you develop any new symptoms or signs.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

In addition, females are protected during their child bearing period by their hormones so they don't get heart attacks.  i can not exactly tell you about the reason beind this sharp pain that lasts for such a very short period of time and is intermittent. It could be related to the skin or muscles or a nerve, it could also be related to the membrane surrounding the lung overstretched for a few seconds when you take a deep breath in.  If this pain gets any worth or starts to be longer in duration, i would definitely advise you to go to the er to be checked.

    "content": "Dear Beenaboo,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Chest pain in a 26 years old female is usually not related to coronary disease which is the most feared of all the causes of chest pain as females are protected by their hormones during the child bearing period. Although your pain has some of the typical characteristics of coronary pain (pressure in nature, going to left arm and increasing with exercise), yet it has other atypical characteristics (increasing with deep breathing and having continuous chest pressure and left arm numbness).  Since you went to the er during the pain and had an ekg done and was normal during the pain, my inclination is to go with other causes of non-cardiac origin.  i would suggest that you have an x-ray of the neck spine to make sure that you don't have a problem with your neck spine as this continuous left arm numbness is a sign of a neck spine problem (compressed nerves).

    "content": "I had an ablation for constant PVC's (600/  hr by Holter).  My physician used a computer that created a 3D image of my heart by cardiac mapping. He had to ablate very near the AV node and told my husband that he had to slow my heart down.  I was kept overnight and released the next day with a heart rate of 45.  I resumed my Tambocor (50 mg/ BID) and my heart rate never went above 45. Three days later I blacked out and my husband had to take me to the ER. In the ER, my heart rate was 30 and went down to 20. They administered Atropine from the crash cart which sent me into V-tach. I was rushed from the ER to the Cardiac Lab, where a permanent pacemaker was implanted. My heart rate is now between 75-80,but I still have PVC's, and I am still on the Tambocor. Will I remain on medication for the rest of my life?  The reason for the ablation was my PVC's were not helped by the medication. I still have them, I'm still on medication and now I have a pacemaker too!  Megthered\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Permanent pacemaker after ablation",
    "content": "Dear Megthered,  Thank you very much for using our website.  i am not an electrophysiolgist to begin with and they are the best people to deal with arrhythmias.  Where you having any problems related to the pvcs like faiting or shortness of breath or chest pain? Have you had episodes of v-tach with the pvcs? Do you have any underlying structural heart disease? What did your electophysiologist think about the origin and the cause of the pvcs? Have you tried medications other than the tambocor for the pvcs?  i think that any kind of ablation is associated with an increase risk of developing heart block as the site of ablation gets closer to the a-v node.  A permanent pace maker was implanted in your case because it is anticipated that you are going to be on antiarrhythmic medications which can cause bradycardia in addition to the bradycardia you already have after ablation to make sure you don't start having lots of syncopal episodes.  If you have not tried medications other than the tambocor, my suggestion is to discuss it further with your doctor as there are medications like amiodarone that have been proven to be very effective. Of course, these medications have their own drawbacks, but if you still get pvcs even after ablation and while on tambocor, may be it is time for another medication. There are other medications like the beta blockers group, propafenone and others that electrophysiologist are usually more familiar with.   The problem with arrhythmias and antiarrhythmic medications is that it is all trial and error. You might respond to a medication that other patients won't respond to or you might develop allergy or a side effect from this or that medication, so, it is trial and error till the right combination is reached and now that you have a pacemaker, a combination of medications can even be used.   i know it is difficult to tell someone after all that he/she been through that you will have to be on medications for the rest of your life.  If the pvcs are giving you less problems than before the ablation and they significantly decreased then it would not be an unreasonable decision if you absolutely don't want to take the medication to discuss stoping the medication with your doctor (never stop the tambocor or other heart medication suddenly, you have to discuss it with your doctor first).

    "content": "Hello Everyone,   About 1 week, I started feeling some tingling and a feeling on tightening in my chest and left arm. Thursday night, I went to the go to the ER because the discomfort was getting worse.   They did an EKG and everything checked out normal... They classified it as an \"atypical chest pain\" which was not \"heart pain\". They gave me ibuprofin to help ease the discomfort...   Friday I met with my doctor who referred me to a cardiologist for further evaluation (since I have a history of heart problems in my family - high cholesterol and father had a heart attack at 53)...   The cardiologist gave me a stress test w/an echocardiogram... Again, everything seemed fine.. The only issue was my cholestorol (Total 240) for which I am now on Lipitor.  He believes that it may be acid passing up the esophagus which hits the same nerves that are close to the heart... He gave been some meds (protonix and carafate) to keep the acidity under control.   Even with the \"good news\" about it not being heart releated - i am very concerned since this tingling and discomfort in my chest and arm have not subsided...  I still continue to get a tingling/burning/squeezing sensation from the center to the left side of my chest, under my arms to the elbow..  Now, I am also getting stronger squeezing sensations in my mid to upper back..   I am still pretty young (30) and in good shape, but I am still very scared out especially since I do have an issue with high cholesterol - i have pretty much had high cholestorol for many years...   I have a followup with my cardiologist on Dec 2nd to see if the protonix and carafate have helped, but I was wondering if I should insist on further testing of my heart.  I would like to have the thallium test if not a cath test just to assure me that there is no problem... These are supposed to be more accuarate in detecting blockages correct?  For some reason my gut tells me that there is something more that just \"reflux\"  Any advice would be greatly appreciated...   Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pain in chest, high blood pressure",
    "content": "Dear shb203,   Thank you very much for using our website.   Chest pain is usually worrisome for coronary disease. Coronary disease has factors the presence/absence of which can usually predict fairly well the probability of the person complaining of chest pain having or not having coronary disease.   These risk factors include family history, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, sedentary life style and obesity. You did not mention if your father had a heart attack (and if yes how old was he then) before having his bypass surgery, whether you smoke or not, whether you excercise regularly and how much do you weigh. You mentionned that you are being treated for hypertension and high cholersterol and since your mom is a diabetic, you are most probably prone to develop diabetes (were you ever tested for diabetes?).   Chest pain caused by heart disease usually has certain characteritics. The coronary pain is usually a sharp pain, but can be perceived by patients as pressure, burning or stabbing sensation. It usually occurs on exertion, lasts for a few minutes and is relieved by rest. Its location is usually behind the breast bone and can move to other places like the left arm, the back or the neck. If severe enough it can be associated with nausea, vomiting and sweating. So, the vomiting, sweating that you had the first time can be related to the pain, but unfortunately these symptoms are so non-specific and they are not an indication that the pain that you had is of coronary disease but just the pain that you had might be severe.   The answer to all these questions makes it most of the time easy on the physician to decide the origin of the chest pain and whether it is cardiac in origin or not (from the heart).   Obviously if the only source of chest pain was the heart, it would have been very easy for doctors to diagnose all patients who present with chest pain, but there are other sources and the symptoms are sometimes vague enough so that doctors resort to other resources to try to diagnose the source of the pain.   Your visit to the emergency department was a good step and my guess is that they thought the pain that you are having is most probably not heart related and that is why they did not admit you to the hospital. And you did not mention what they thought was the reason behind the chest pain.   You are being treated for hypertension by lopressor and lotrel but it looks that your blood pressure is not really well controlled. Where does it usually run?   We don't know which comes first, the high blood pressure or the chest pain. High blood pressure as high as the numbers that you mentionned is a high stress on the heart and so you can feel some discomofort or pain in the heart but the main problem is actually your blood pressure. If the pain comes first and it is so severe, you can so anxious and nervous that your blood pressure shoots up but it is rare that it reaches such high levels.   You have quite a few risk factors for coronary disease. My suggestion to you is to discuss this further with your primary care provider and try to have your blood pressure controlled better and see whether this makes a difference in the occurrence of the pain episodes. If this does not make any difference i think it would not be unreasonable to ask him/her if you could have a treadmill stress test with a nuclear scan to evaluate the reason behind your chest pain.   Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and i will be waiting for your response.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Sleep disorders including 'Sleep apnea' and 'Periodic LImb Movement during Sleep' are two other possibilities. Are you obese? Are you hypertensive?  Sleep disorders may require a mental status examination by a doctor.  Patient education on age-related changes in sleep and good sleep hygiene may be adequate treatment for many older adults. If the initial history and physical examination findings do not reveal a serious underlying cause, a trial of improved sleep hygiene is the best initial approach. The common recommended measures include the following:  1. Maintain a regular wake-up time.  2. Maintain a regular sleeping time.  3. Decrease or eliminate daytime naps.  4. Exercise daily but not immediately before bedtime.  5. Use the bed only for sleeping or sex.  6. Do not read or watch television in bed.  7. Do not use bedtime as worry time.  8. Avoid heavy meals at bedtime.  9. Limit or eliminate alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine before bedtime.  10. Maintain a routine period of preparation for bed, eg, washing up, brushing, and so forth.  11. Control the nighttime environment with comfortable temperature, quietness, and darkness.  12. Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothes to bed.   If unable to sleep within 30 minutes, get out of bed and perform a soothing activity, such as listening to soft music or reading, but avoid exposure to bright light during these times.   Get adequate exposure to bright light during the day.   Avoid daytime naps. Daytime naps decrease nighttime sleep. Overweight people who are habitual loud snorers may be helped by weight loss. All people who snore loudly should abstain from alcohol or other sedatives before going to bed. They should also take measures to avoid supine sleeping (eg, by taping a tennis ball to the back of their bedclothes).  In the absence of sleep apnea, contributing conditions, such as allergies, nasal pathology, or nasopharyngeal enlargement, should be evaluated by an ear, nose, and throat specialist.  If the sleep problem is secondary to some medical problem, then the primary problem needs treatment rather than the sleep problem.   Polysomnography is indicated when primary sleep disorders such as 'Sleep Apnea' or 'Periodic LImb Movement during Sleep' are suspected.  Hope this helps.  Warm regards,  - Bill\n\n",

There are however, many causes of chest pain other than heart disease. The only way to pin down the cause is by physical examination. It could easily turn out to be muscle pain related to your effort. In such a case a simple muscle relaxant will do the job. Get an appointment with your doctor. If he is suspicious he will perform an ECG or thalium scan to rule out ischemic heart disease. Regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Fearuvhorses,  Thank you very much for using our website.  There is no specific heart rate that is accompanied by shortness of breath perse.  You can have shortness of breath if your heart rate is too slow as well.  The normal range for heart rate is 60-90 and most would not call it tachycardia till it gets above 100.  So, definitely you have tachycardia at rest. If a patient has tachycardia at rest, it is always wise to rule out hyperactivity of the thyroid gland. Personally i think the most common reason of high heart rate at rest is being out of shape. If you get pain when you exercise and your heart rate goes up you need to be on a beta blocker and i know that in your history you were prescribed atenolol and it made you feel weak. You can take another type of medication called calcium channel blockers to slow your heart rate and they have some antianginal properties as well.   About nitro, after taking nitro, the heart rate goes reflexly as the blood pressure drops. About hydrochlorothiazide, if you take too much and you get dehydrated from, yes it will make your heart rate go up.  Regarding your chest pains. If you get chest pains that are not relieved by 3 tabs of nitro under the tongue 5 minutes apart, you need to go to the nearest emergency room.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "pacemaker and more problems",
    "content": "Dear Jordan03,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Pacemakers usually take care of slow heart rate and not fast heart rates.  You never mentionned anything about your underlying heart condition.   From all i could get is that it looks like you could have sick sinus syndrome. Getting a fast heart rate and slow heart rated at the same time treated with medications to control the fast heart rate (lopressore and amiodarone in your case) and a pacemaker at the same time (to make sure that your heart rate does not get too slow or even stop sometimes).  Another possibility is that you had a heart attack at one point and your conduction system was compromised in addition to having a problem with fast arrhythmias and you were started on medications for the arrhythmias but since you had a vulnerable conduction system to begin with, it was chosen to put a pacemaker in to make sure that your heart rate does not get too slow. Although i think that the best choice would have been another device called a defibrillator (which is a pacemaker/defibrillator combo).  In any case, getting dizzy with the fast heart rate is a very worrisome symptom. It means that your heart is pumping so fast that there is not enough blood reaching the brain and this means that you can lose consciousness at any time.  If this happens again you have to go immediately to the nearest emergency room and have them check an e.c.g. and your blood pressure.  You have to see your doctor immediately and most probably he will restart you on your medications that you are not taking.  This is a serious thing. This fast heart rate could endup in your heart stopping unexpectedly. Please, do not take it lightly and go see your doctor.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jananna,  Thank you very much for using our website.  The best thing to do is to have an Ekg (electric drawing of the heart) during these episodes. It will allow to see the exact rate and the rhythm of the heart and whether normal or abnormal.  Meanwhile, till you see your doctor try to remain calm. Cut down on the coffee or any caffeinated beverages (pop, mountain due, etc...), stop smoking if you are, and try to get enough sleep and avoid over exertion.  Usually the blood tests will be in the form of electrolyes, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus levels and thyroid function tests because disturbance in the heart rhythm is sometimes associated with abnormalities of these parameters.  i can not tell what this is unless you have an Ekg unfortunately.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "19 y/o male, overweight but active.  Non-smoker, no alcohol.  Total cholesterol 130.  No family history of heart problems.  About 10 months ago I started to have bursts of tachycardia.  These occured while I was resting or doing some non-strenuous walking (shopping, for example).  I would notice my heartrate pick up quickly, peaking at 130 - 150 bpm for 20-45 seconds.  I had a stress test, blood workup, EKG, and holter.  I also cut back on caffeine.  Stress, blood labs, and EKGs came back normal.  My doc did mention that she suspected WPW at first due to something she saw on the EKG - I can't remember if it was the QT interval or the ?RS interval being borderline long.  The holter captured several episodes and they were all normal, 1:1 sinus tach.  For the first 2 1/2 mos I had frequent episodes - in December they were just about every day - sometimes two in one day.  No shortness of breath, chest pain, etc. though I did sometimes feel mildly lightheaded.  I think that may have simply been from the anxiety.  The episodes severely decreased in frequency and I have been down to one every 2-3 mos. for several mos. now.  I do get the occasional palpitation, probably 2 or 3 per week.  I saw a second cardiologist and he did an echo and a tilt.  The echo was normal but I failed the tilt.  He diagnosed vasovagal pre-syncope as I never had any fainting spells.  I can and do exercise and have never had any associated discomfort or problems.  My questions are: 1.  Could the vasovagal pre-syncope explain the tachycardia?  I  saw the second doctor about the tachycardia and I felt like he never really adressed the issue beyond the echo. 2.  Given the normal baseline EKGs and stress test, does this sound like it is probably a benign and rather boring arrythmia, or is there something you know of that may present these symptoms and is difficult to diagnose? 3.  Should I seek a third opinion as I was not very satisfied with  the second?  Should I inquire about an EP study?  4.  I have read about SVT and PSVT.  Would those be apparent in the episodes captured by the holter?  Could the holter results distinguish between atrial tachyarrhythmias and AV tachyarrhythmias? 5.  Could a history of tachycardia 'episodes' indicate a predisposition to future problems like afib etc. and does it increase my risk of other health problems IE sudden arrest, blood clots etc...\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Question about svt/psvt",
    "content": "Dear Cjsomar,  Thank you very much for using our website.  You sound like you read a lot of cardiology in the last few months.  Palpitations are sometimes difficult to deal with because they may be caused by either normal rhythms that you just feel (and normally you should not feel your heart beating) or by abnormal rhythms that are sometimes difficult to catch especially if they are paroxysmal (come in attacks) as in your case.  i assume from what you told me that the blood work that was done for you contained all the things that are usually ordered in these circumstances such as electrolytes, calcium level, phosphorus level, magnesium level and thyroid function tests.  If any of these were not done, please, ask your doctor to order them for you. In addition please check a complete blood count.  In addition, i am not sure about your blood pressure during these episodes and whether it is normal or not. Because if it was higher than normal, you should be investigated for a condition called pheochromocytoma which causes bouts of hypertension and tachycardia.  You did well by cutting down on your caffeine and i hope that by saying cutting down you mean completely stopping.   If the holter showed sinus tachycardia, this is normal rhythm but at a faster than normal rate which is not easy to deal with because usually it can not be given anti-arrhythmic medications like the other rhythms.   Regarding svt/psvt, the holter should be able to pick it up but sometimes it is not that easy. A regular ecg would be better if possible because it shows more leads and the recording is usually of better quality although of very short duration in comparison to the holter.  About the vasovagal presyncope, it is not related to the tachycardia because this type of syncope is a cardioinhibitory, vasodepressor syncope which means that the person who suffers from this type of syncope will pass out because his/her heart rate will be low and the person will develop hypotension (low blood pressure). And it sounds from what you said that the cardiologist did not give any medication to take for it.  Regarding the future probability that you might develop atrial fibrillation or not or have an increased chance of sudden death, i can not answer that question because i really do not know what type of arrhythmia you have and whether it is related to other cardiac disease or it is just an idiopathic arrhythmia. Although the echo being normal ruled out lots of organic cardiac causes of arrhythmias such valvular diseases.  If you are really worried about this arrhythmias, like you said you can be asked to see a specialist in eps and seek his opinion regarding whether or not it would be valuable and worth your while to go through an ep study.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and please keep me posted and if you still need any clarification or more questions answered, do not hesitate to post them immediately.

    "title": "Re: After Ablation",
    "content": "Dear Jenny,  Thank you very much for using our website.  i am sure your doctor (your cardiologist/electrophysiologist) told you all about the natural pacemakers of the heart and which one takes over in what sequence if something happens to the sinus node.  Looks like the svt that you were having was so severe to the extent that you were taking medications and then had an ep study with ablation. Normally, when the heart is exposed to adrenaline, the heart rate increases. i am not sure what you meant by \"huge\" increase in the heart rate? Could this means that your heart is more sensitive to adrenaline than normal? Could be. So, what is the reason of you being more sensitive to adrenaline than normal? There are few causes which can do that including hyperthyroidism (over activity fo the thyroid gland), drinking too much caffeinated beverages, lack of sleep, stress. All of these should have been ruled out, but i am sure since you have had this problem for a while that this was dealt with as a cause for your fast heart rate to begin with.  i am not an electrophysiologist and i can not comment on the presence or absence of abnormal pathways during an ep study and the pitfalls of finding them. Normally in the a/v node (the one between the atrium and the ventricle) there are 2 pathways and this gives the opportunity to the initiation of svt in the right circumstances and if there are no other additional abnormal pathways, i am not sure of the protocol but i think that they usually ablate the a/v node (which normally contains the 2 pathways) so that it does not generate this arrhythmia, but remember i am not an electrophysiologist.  Now, coming to your question about the pacemaker. Normally the heart beats at a rate of 60-90 beats per minute. So your heart rate of 38-40 is low and your body needs more and that's why you are having the symptoms of dizziness and being tired.   During exercise the heart should be able to increase its rate to cope with the increase in the body's metabolic demands. If the heart is not able to do that, this is called chronotropic insufficiency and then a pacemaker should be inserted to help the body beat at a faster rate. How would you know if your heart is not beating at the rate it should during exercise. There are symptoms of dizziness, easy fatiguability, shortness of breath, may be loss of consciousness sometimes.  There is an exercise protocol where the patient is put on a treadmill and exercised and the heart rate response is watched and this is the way, chronoctropic insufficiency is diagnosed, a holter monitor is another tool because it watches the heart rate all over the 24 hours and while a patient is wearing it he/she should do all of the regular activities of the day so that the heart rate response could be watched during various activities.  About pacemakers, it is usually a more or less an invasive procedure but not a major one and in good hands the rate of complications is very low.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped. Good luck and please keep me posted.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

So, can a 40% blockage go to a more significant blockage in just six weeks.  Also, what other causes for angina, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate (180 during stress test and still at 130 10 minutes after the test), elevated blood pressure if not a blocked artery?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Fearuvhorses,  Thank you very much for using our website.  You have to tell me more about yourself. Male or female? How old? Smoking or not? Family history of coronary disease at a young age? Do you exercise or lead a sedentary life?  If you had an angiogram that showed that you do not need anything except medications, why did you have a stress test. The angiogram overrides the stress test and it was already done, so i do not know why did you have the stress test.  What do you mean by a positive stress test? What kind of stress test was it? Did you walk on a treadmill? Did you have chest pain while walking? How long were you able to go on the treadmill (if you had a treadmill test) before you had to stop or have the chest pain?  Were there any ekg changes? Was a radioactive substance injected? Lots of questions to answer.  In which artery is the 40% blockage? Can the lesion change in 6 weeks, sure it can.  But any significant change will be so dramatic that it will result in a heart attack most probably.  The standard of care in your case is to take aspirin indefinitely, beta blockers (for heart protection and hypertension), lipitor (or any medication that lowers your cholesterol) because they were found to have other beneficial functions (to the arteries) besides lowering the cholesterol and it should be the bad cholesterol (ldl) and not the total cholesterol that should be followed (should be less than 100 according to the last guidelines). Altace and the like medications are used if you had a heart attack and for high blood pressure. i do not know the kinds of side effects that you had but if these side effects were tolerable, then it is better that you go back to these medications or let you doctor find an alternative for them.  About your last question, angina is usually caused by a blocked artery. Shortness of breath has lots of causes begining at not being physically fit and ending with severe heart and lung diseases. Rapid heart rate can also has many causes.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and hope that this information helped and waiting for your reply.

    "content": "In reply:  I am a 42-year old, non-smoking, caucasian female.  Family history includes my father with a 1st heart attack at 40 and 1 subsequent at approx.  55ish (??).  My paternal grandparents were 1st cousins, following a pattern of several generations of intermarriage between two clans.  Both died of heart attacks.  Grandmother at an early age and grandfather at 60ish.  Of my father's 12 siblings, 1 died in infancy, 8 died of heart attack or stroke and his remaining 3 living siblings have all had either heart attack or stroke.  One cousin died of heart attack at 37, 1 of aneurism at 42.  One cousin had a child died of heart failure at 22.  My brother had a stroke at age 45.  All are diabetic.  I am glucose intolerant.  Most aunts had fatal 1st heart attacks before 55.  I do not live a totally sedentary lifestyle but neither am I athletic.  I am overweight.  I walk, when able, most days for 20-40 minutes.  Angiogram showed 40% blockage (early April) and was deemed not to be significant.  I had to discontinue Lipitor due to muscle cramps and something to do with what showed up in blood tests (liver??).  I have re-started the Atenolol and have found that by splitting the doseage into half in the morning and half in the evening that I have minimized the side affects significantly.  I can take aspirin every 2nd day and still get red spots (like little bursted blood vessels) but do not get daily nosebleeds.  The stress test involved walking on a treadmill.  I developed chest pain and shortness of breath in less than a minute.  As this is usual during daily activity I elected to finish the test and actually insisted on doing so.  My report stated \"2.20 horizontal to downsloping ST segment depression\".  I have no idea what this means and would appreciate further clarification.  The test was ordered because of continuing chest pain.   An exercise MIBI has been booked for further investigation.  Angina continues to worsen, with more episodes occurring at night and several that have instantly dropped me to my knees with pain and lightheadedness so extreme I come close to passing out.  These can last up to 10 minutes and usually are a result of unusual excitement or physical activity.  Thank you.  Any further information would certainly be appreicated.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Fearuvhorses,   Thank you very much for using our website.   Your family history is definitely one that has lots of cornary disease.  Glucose intolerance is an old term now it is called prediabetes (before diabetes), so you are going to develop diabetes at a certain point (if you really were glucose intolerant). Putting this fact in mind. You have to try to modify your life style the best way you can in addition to try to control your health problems (like high blood pressure and high cholesterol) the best you can.  Like i said, you have to take the asa, very good that you are taking the atenolol. There are other medications that could control your cholesterol in addition to losing weight and exercise although with the numbers, these will not be enough and you will have to take medications (they do not have to be of the lipitor family), there are other medications that can lower the cholesterol that you can use if you had the muscle problems with the lipitor and its family (no need to take any risk).   About your stress test. Although i was not in agreement with doing the test but stoping the test after one minute together with the ekc changes that you mentionned will give us no valuable information (putting in mind that we know the results of the angiogram). Unless there was a dramatic change in your lesion and if this is the case especially with the kind of symptoms you described at the end of your message (night time angina) my advice is to go ahead and repeat the angiogram immediately.

    "content": "Dear Fearuvhorses,   Thank you very much for using our website.  A positive stress test is indicated by many things of which are chest pain, shortness of breath and ekg changes. The ekg changes could be st depression (should be more than 1 mm in leads that correlate with heart territories supplied by the same coronory artery) and could be in the form of st elevation (in case of coronary artery spasm).   In general stress tets are only 70-75% sensitive and in women, stress tests are less sensitive than in men even, that's why most of the time, the test is complemented with injection of a radioactive material that shows the blood supply of the heart (through certain pictures). So, let's say the patient gets chest pain during the stress test and the ekg shows changes and then the radioactive material pictures show that the blood supply to the area where the ekg changes happened then we know that this is a positive stress test.  Stress tests are used to know whether a patient has coronary disease or not. If a patient comes with symptoms strongly suggestive of coronary disease like typical central chest pain during exercise, relieved by rest, pressure in nature, all the typical charateristics, does this person need to have a stress test? The answer is no, because most probably the stress test will be positive (and even if it comes back negative), this patient needs an angiogram, so a stress test usually is not done in these circumstances and angiography is immediately done.  In my opinion, in your case, repeating a stress test after an angiogram is not going to help much because we know that you have a 40% lesion which if your symptoms have changes since the angiogram could mean that the lesion has worsenned but usually the change is so dramatic that  the result is usually a heart attack or in rare cases onset of severe symptoms.

    "content": "I have just recently within the past few weeks experienced dizzy spells. Only when I lean my head back or get up quickly. I suffer no other dizzy spells only as indicated. I have had my blood pressure checked recently and it is fine. The only medical condition that I have is a curve in my spine at the base of my neck. I also suffer frequent hot flashes. I am 37 years old and have 2 children. I am in good health. I am a smoker and a drinker. several drinks per evening. I have no ear aches or problems that may point to an equalibrium problem.  My diet is normal and I work 2 jobs. I am slightly overwieght. I am  5'7 and am about 180 lbs. Any insight would be appreciated. This is very annoying.\n\n",

    "title": "Dizziness",
    "content": "cciarrochi,  What exactly do you mean by dizziness? is it dizziness in the sense of fainting or do you feel that the room moves around you briefly? You mentioned that you have two jobs.. are you getting enough rest? Fatigue can easily lead to symptoms such as dizziness.  Here are some of the causes of vertigo:   Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).  BPPV involves intense, brief episodes of dizziness associated with a change in the position of your head, often when you turn over in bed or sit up in the morning. It occurs when particles of calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia) break loose and fall into the wrong part of the canals in your inner ear. When these particles shift, they stimulate sensors in your ear, producing an episode of vertigo. Doctors don't know what triggers BPPV, but it may be a natural result of aging. Trauma to your head also may lead to BPPV.   Inflammation in the inner ear (acute vestibular neuronitis or labyrinthitis).  Signs and symptoms of this condition include sudden, intense vertigo that may persist for several days, with nausea and vomiting. It can be incapacitating, requiring bed rest to minimize the symptoms. Fortunately, vestibular neuronitis generally subsides and clears up on its own. Although the cause of this condition is unknown, it may be a viral infection.   Meniere's disease.  This disease involves the buildup of fluid in your inner ear. It may affect adults at any age and is characterized by sudden episodes of vertigo lasting 20 minutes or longer. Other symptoms include the feeling of fullness in your ear, buzzing or ringing in your ear (tinnitus), and fluctuating hearing loss. The cause of Meniere's disease is unknown.   Acoustic neuroma.  An acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous (benign) growth on the acoustic nerve, which connects the inner ear to your brain. Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma may include dizziness, loss of balance, hearing loss and tinnitus.   Rapid changes in motion.  Riding on a roller coaster or in boats, cars or even airplanes may on occasion make you dizzy.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Left arm pain, elbow shocks, carpal tunnel? Wrist brace?",
    "content": "Hi.  For the last year or so, I have had \"problems\" with my left arm. Sometimes it will become very heavy feeling, with a dull pain. That will usually last about half an hour, and occurs very rarely. Sometimes I will get pretty extreme pain, starting by my hand, and ending at my shoulder. When that happens, it's constant for about three or four days, then just disappears. And sometimes, most often of the three, when I put my elbow on the table, I will get a shock, starting at my elbow, and travelling up my arm to my shoulder. The shock is so great, it brings tears to my eyes. And it doesn't happen only once. Some days, I cannot put my elbow down all day, for each time, there will be the shock. Do you have any idea what could be causing these things to happen? I went to the doctor the last time I had the extreme pain, starting at my wrist, and she said she thought I might have a slight form of carpeltunnel. She had me wear a wrist brace to bed for a week. I really don't think it helped. The pain went away, but every time it's come, even without the brace, it eventually went away. I'm 22 years old and in fairly good health. Thank you.  -Stefa\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, thank you very much for providing this service.  I am a 34 year old Caucasian female with no significant health history.  However, I was adopted as a baby and don't have any info regarding my biological family.  I don't smoke and my weight is 210 and I'm 5'10\". I've never had any high blood pressure, heart problems or any health problems.  I had my cholesterol tested two years ago and it was 190, but I don't remember the HDL/LDL levels.  For probably the last 3 weeks or so, I just have not felt very good.  My chest (center, area between my breasts) has been tight, as though I have weight on it.  While it's uncomfortable, I don't actually have any trouble breathing.  Also I have really noticed my heart pounding, especially after any exertion, but it just feels extra-strong all the time over the past few weeks.  I admit to being mostly sedentary and not eating enough veggies, along with too many fatty foods.  Am I just reaping the consequences of my lifestyle?? At least for the past few years I haven't been in shape, but I've never felt consistenly this bad before.  Is it worth going to my doctor and asking for some tests - what tests?  If I improve my eating habits and get more exercise will these feelings (chest tightness, heart pounding) get better?  I just don't know what's normal and I'd really appreciate some advice.  Thank you very much for your help.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Palpitations",
    "content": "Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for using our website.  When do you have this chest tightness? How long does it last when you have it? Do you have sweating or shortness of breath with it? Do you feel dizzy? Have you ever used any medications to help you lose weight? Do you get short of breath with exertion?  The chest tightness and palpitations could be related because some people feel palpitations as chest tightness or the palpitations give them this uncomfortable feeling in the chest.  In a young female, unless there are strong risk factors like diabetes, high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, very high cholesterol and strong family history, usually coronay artery disease is not thought of at the top of the list.  In a sedenteary person, i would first think of physical unfitness as a cause of palpitations which might give you this uncomfortable feeling in the chest.  Palpitations can be caused by many causes: 1. Unfitness. 2. Smoing. 3. Too much caffeine in the blood, for example coffee, tea, pop that contains caffeine. 4. Thyroid problems. 5. Heart problems. 6. Lung problems. 7. Electrolyte imbalances. 8. Not getting enough sleep.  Is it worth it to go to your doctor? i think it is always worth it to see your doctor if you have symptoms that have been lingering for close to a month now.  My guess is that this is just physical unfitness. Your doctor might want to do an ekg or a stress test if he thinks that this is related to coronary disease although i personally think that this is a remote possibility. Other blood tests include electrolytes (salts in the blood) and thyroid functions.  About the medications that can make you lose weight, the phen/fen combination was found to be associated with mitral and aortic valve that could lead to the same symptoms. If you have been treated with this combination, then i think it is not unreasonable to obtain an echocardiogram.

    "content": "Dear Aini,  Thank you very much for using our website.  The only thing that differentiates angina from myocardial infarction is blood testing to know whether or not the heart sustained damage. These blood tests measure substances present in the heart muscle and which are released into the blood when the heart muscle dies. So, if these substances are elevated, then damage did occur and this is a heart attack, if not elevated then these blood tests have to redone in six hours as some times release of these substances in the blood is delayed to make sure that there was no delay release of these substances.  Referred pain at left shoulder implies that this is one the characteristics of the cardiac pain and sometimes helps to differentiate other causes of chest pain.

    "content": "Dear Tmari,   Thank you very much for using our website.   You have not said whether you are a male or a female. Whether you smoke or not, whether you have any chronic disease for which you are treated and whether any of your first fegree family members (mother, father, older brother or sister) had heart attacks in the past or not.   Also you did not mention how long the pain lasts, is it related to exercise in any way and what do you do to make the pain go away.   Your family history of high blood pressure and diabetes is to be considred.   A blood pressure of 152/90 is high. But once only should not be considered. It has be consistently high on at least 3 different occasions.   The symptoms that you are describing could be related to many things.   Chest pain is always worriesome for coronary disease. At 24 years old, it is rare to have coronary disease, but it is not unheard of. Other causes of chest pain at your age could be related to other conditions such as mitral valve prolapse and blood clots going to the lungs among others.   Having shortness of breath could be related to:  1. Being physically unfit (you are a little but overweight  whether you are a male or a female).  2. Asthma.  3. Having high blood pressure.  4. Coronary disease.  5. Having recurrent blood clots to your lungs (especially  with these symptoms of chest pain, leg pain and  shortness of breath).   In my opinion you have to go see your doctor and you have to be checked by doing an ekg, may be a stress test (after the doctor hears your stroy and examines you), tested for the presence of asthma and if he decides makes sure that you do not have repeated blood clots in your lungs.

    "content": "Dear Harold,   Thank you very much for using our website.   What i understood from your message is that you have chest pain all the time. Is this pain like the pain that you had before they put the stent? It sounds that you exercise on regular basis and you do not have a problem with that and this is a good indication. If you want to make sure that there is nothing to be alarmed about, you could ask your doctor to do a stress test for you with ekg monitoring and see how your heart does and whether the ekg will show any changes.   My advice to you is to stop smoking immediately and if you are finding difficulties you can seek the help of your doctor in prescribing a medication (zyban) or setting a plan for you with the patches.   About chronic fatigue, it could be caused by many things but medications could be one of them and you are taking two medications that could cause fatigue (lortab and valium), other causes could be related to thyroid gland dysfunction or anemia (low hemoglobin).   About your high white count, you did not mention how high it has been running and how long it has been running high. The complete blood picture can give some idea about the abnormality in your high white count subgroups and if any of the subgroups is abnormal then other tests should be performed according to which one is abnormal.

Dry coughing could be sometimes the first symptomp of a person having heart failure especially if this is related to exercise.   However, you having a heart condition you are most probably taking medications that can cause such cough.   These medications are of the Ace-i type such as captopril, lisinopril and the like and they are very well known to cause dry cough.   If you have an arrhythmia condition, you could also be taking one of the medications that can cause lung problems and it is called amiodarone.   So if you are taking any of these medications, then it is best that you talk to your doctor about this and then he could offer some help for you.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Rob,   Thank you very much for using our website.   Passing out can be caused by many things. Though the 2 main categories under which for passing out is classified are either related to brain or to heart.   The major brain causes that might lead to passing out are:  1. Having a seizure.  2. Having a precedant to stroke.  3. Having a stroke.   The major heart causes that might lead to passing out are:  1. Having low blood pressure.  2. Having a slow heart rate.  3. Having an abnormal fast heart rhythm.  4. Having extremely high blood pressure.  5. Simple fainting.   Your dad must see a doctor and some blood tests, x-rays and other specialized tests should be done.   Losing control over his bladder could be related to a brain cause most probably seizure in my mind more than the others yet this can not be confirmed until he is seen by a doctor.

While I was in the hospital for my thyroid surgery they became worse, the nurse listened to my chest and could clearly hear the heart palps, they did an EKG which showed the palpitations, I was told that I was to watch for an increase in palps, but they did decrease by the time I was released. Now it's back, and they are very strong, I drink no caffiene, but I do smoke. Sometimes my whole body moves with the palps, it's like my heart slams against my chest once really hard and it's scary. I had an ecocardiogram about 5 years ago before being diagnosed with graves disease and I guess the test came out ok, and also had a heart moniter. What could be causing these strong palpitations? I've never had them this bad before:(    Thanks,  Tanya\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Palpitations (Heart beats)",
    "content": "Dear Tanya,   Thank you very much for using our website.   Palpitations is the sensation of feeling your heart beats.   Normally we do not feel our hearts beating because they beat in a regular fashion (rhythm and rate) and we are accustomed to the strength of the beat so it does not disturb us.   If there is a change in the strength or any irregularity of the heart rhythm or change in the heart rate (whether racing or slowing), then we will start feeling our heart beating.   What you said about the nurses hearing your heart palpitations means that she heard your heard beating which is non-specific and does not give any additional information as to what is the nature or the cause of the heart palpitations. Doing an ekg could be helpful if you had an abnormal rhythm and from what you said, i could not understand what kind of abnormal rhythm you had.   Having a hyperactive thyroid whatever may be the cause (in your case Graves' diseaes) is a well known cause of heart rhythm problems. Since you had surgery, and i do no know what type (was the whole gland taken out or part of it?). And you mentionned that you have an underactive thyroid now, were you started on thyroid hormone replacement pills? Were your thyroid hormones blood levels measured? Did you experience any thing else besides these palpitations like numbness around the mouth or spasms in your hands or feet?   If these palpitations are not caused by serious rhythm disturbances, i would just monitor them and make sure that your thyroid hormones levels are normal and that other factors that may contribute to abnormal rhythms of the heart like too much caffeine, smoking and abnormal electrolytes in the blood (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and phosphorus) are all normalized.   In your case, i think that you might have had fast heart rate before surgery and then you started to be accustomed to it and once you had surgery and your heart rate started going down, you started to feel the stronger, slower heart beats. Or that you were taking inderal and it was suddenly discontinued and you started to have fast heart rate once more.   If you still have these palpitations, after all possibilities have been persued, and they are really bothering you, the best thing to do is to take a beta-blocker type medication such as inderal (which i am sure you have been taking during treatment with Graves' disease) which helps both arrhythmia and anxiety.

    "title": "Fatigue many years after heart attack",
    "content": "I had a serious heart attack in 1985. Although that experience makes me tired, especially when I do physical work invovling any great exertion, for the past year I have been suffering extreme fatigue. My internist tells me that my heart condition is stabilized and that the fatigue is not cardiac related. Similarly, a cardiologist tells me that I have stabilized. My blood sugar was high (117 or so , up from 77 a year earlier) at my last physical#test taken Dec. 31, 2001; I have my blood sugar retested in early July. Could the fatigue be related be caro-sugar fatigue exacerbated, perhaps, by cardiac problems? My internist keeps telling me he has no explanation for the fatigue, having testing me for thyroid and other problems. jes\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Fatigue",
    "content": "Dear Jes,   Thank you very much for using our website.   Chronic fatigue is a very annoying problem. Sometimes it has a cause and sometimes one can not find any reason for it.   Checking a thyroid test was a very good thing to do.   In your case, there could be several reasons to feel fatigue. You could have mild degree of heart failure although i doubt it since you already saw your cardiologist.  Other causes include:  - Simple physical unfitness.  - Some medications that you are taking for your coronary disease, examples include a group of medications called beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol and the likes).  - Some medications that are used to treat high cholesterol (at top of the list zocor and the likes).  - If you have a condition known as \"sleep apnea\".  - Sometimes, the first symptom of depression might just be chronic fatigue.  - There are some infections that can cause chronic fatigue.   You might want to take some of these ideas to your doctor in the next visit, see what he thinks and go from there.

    "content": "I have been seeing my doctor for several months due to swelling in my legs and shortness of breath after limited activity. I am 38, overweight, a diabetic (type 1 for 20 years) with an underactive thyroid, high blood pressure. I have had the ultrasound on my heart, lung/breathing tests, echo stress test and all have come back normal. I am taking Lasiks but the swelling and breathing problems persist. Since my doctor could find nothing \"new\" wrong with me, she's stopped looking. Can you possibly give me some ideas to bring up at my next appointment? She seems willing to order any and all tests....\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Swelling in the legs",
    "content": "Dear funnygirl,   Thank you very much for choosing our website.   Difficulty breathing and swelling of the legs can be caused by several things.   First of all, they both can be caused by the same cause or each one of them can be caused by a different cause on its own.   Your doctor looked for the main reasons that can cause breathing problems and swelling of the legs in the same time which are heart failure and lung problems.   Still there are some reasons that could cause each symptom separately.   Things that could cause the shortness of breath alone could be:  1. Uncontrolled blood pressure. In the begining it will cause shortness of breath alone but later on (if the person develops heart failure) it will cause both. Why uncontrolled blood pressure causes shortness of breath because of something called \"diastolic dysfunction of the heart\" which is simply abnormality of relaxation of the heart where the heart can not relax enough and thus unable to accomodate the blood coming from the lungs and thus the blood stays for a while more in the lungs and causes shortness of breath.   2. Physical unfitness. Simply if you are physically infit and obese, at some point you will start to have shortness of breath when you exercise.   3. Coronary disease. Being a diabetic for such a long time, although a young female, is a very strong risk factor for developing coronary disease, especially if you smoke or have a history of coronary disease in the family. In some diabetics, they do not have chest pain when they get their coronary disease but their main symptom is shortness of breath and this is called \"angina equivalent\".   Now for the reasons that could cause swelling of the legs alone:   1. Being a diabetic for such a long time, your kidneys might have been affected and when the kidneys are affected they start to spill proteins in the urine and your legs start to swell up.   2. Having what is knwon as venous insufficiency where your veins are not as strong as they used to be and with putting your legs down most of the time (standing or sitting), you will have fluid accumulating in your legs.   3. Medications. This swelling could be caused by medications that you are taking for control of your blood pressure.   4. Liver disease. If you have a liver disease secondary to any cause this could cause you to have swelling of the legs as well.   5. Sleep apnea. Where the person sometimes stops breathing and has to wake up all the time although does not know that he wakes up. Does not get enough sleep and the next morning feels fatigued, sleepy and may be even doses off when doing anything because litterally he thought that he slept but as a mattter he did not. But you do not get the swelling of the legs until late. This disease affects any body but more the obese people.   What i think should be done in your case in addition to the other things that were done is:  1. A stress test.  2. Check levels of proteins in the urine.  3. Check liver functions.  4. Check a good history for having sleep apnea.  5. Exercise, become fit and loose weight. You will say but i get shortness of breath when i exercise, i know, you will have to do it very gradually after making sure that everthing else is ok and there is nothing wrong with your heart.  6. Make sure that you are taking any medications that could cause swelling of the legs.  7. Very good control of blood pressure.   i hope i have given you some ideas and thank you very much choosing our website http://doctorslounge.com and if you have any comments, please, do not hesitate to post them.

    "title": "Re: Fast heart",
    "content": "Dear guest,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Herbal nitro is a product that contains ephedra which is a herb that has high concentrations of ephedrine.    Ephedrine is a drug that works like adrenaline so it basically increases the heart rate, the blood pressure and it was also reported to have caused chest pain and shortness of breath in some patients who took it. It causes nervousness, anxiety, restlessness, headaches dizziness and inability to sleep. Other adverse reactions include nausea and vomiting.  Rare but more severe adverse effects include seizures, heart attack, bleeding in the brain and very high temperature.  The duration of action of ephedrine is from 3-6 hours, so its effects should last this long or may be a little longer.  You have not told me how old are you? Do you have any other diseases like high blood pressure or diabetes or high cholesterol or previous heart disease? Do you smoke? Any family history of heart disease? Are you taking any other medications or non-prescriptions supplements?  The symptoms that you are experiencing could be due to heart damage (heart attack). i would suggest that you go to be checked, have an ecg done and blood tests checked to make sure that there is no damage that happened.\n\n",
