    "content": "Hi, I have a question with regards to some findings or lack there of on my electrophysiology study I had performed about 3 weeks ago, but first I will give you some back ground information.  I am required to get an ecg every 2 years to maintain a medical for the type of work that I perform.  Not once was there ever a noticeable anomoly that I was made aware of.  This past October I had what I now know was a panic attack while at work.  This later morphed into GAD, and I am having a hard time accepting this diagnoses as in the 14 years I worked in this field I never had a bout of anxiety that was not warranted, and I certainly should have.  Upon having this \"panic attack\" I was sent for a myriad of heart tests to rule out any bigger underlying issue.  The ecg came back with a small discrete anomoly (too short of a P wave) The doctor said that at first glance it would likely be passed off as normal and not a concern, but now because this whole issue was effecting my work they were more thorough.  I did a stress test (no problems)than I was referred to a specialist and he suspected and wanted to determine if I had Wolf Parkinson Syndrom, hence the study.  During the study they were not able to mimic or instigate any abnormal arrythmia or condition in my heart so the study was quite short.  The doctor did however say that they noticed something different his exact words were\"I have not seen this in a person your age\" and than proceeded to tell me that when my heart was recovering and going back to a resting pulse there was some abnormal T waves but was not specific.  He than asked me a lot of strange questions with regards to chemotherapy drugs or any other medications that I have been on in the past because they noticed that there could be some sort of scar tissue, that train of questioning stopped rather abruptly.  He than stated that possibly 30 years from now I may need a pacemaker? what the hell.  At any rate I am due for a heart MRI in October and I guess my biggest question is could you break down in laymens terms what he could have been noticing? as well scar tissue? my understanding of that would be from a previous heart attack, unless it happened without my knowledge.  I appreciate any insight as right now I feel pretty much like a mushroom and It seems to me that I should have been told a lot more information.  Regards\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, As your doctor queried you regarding administration of chemotherapy in the past,it may be logical to start from there.   The most well-known cause of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity is Doxorubicin (Adriamycin), one of the  anthracycline class of antibiotics, which remains the most common cause among the well known cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.   There are several manifestations of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. The common electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities reported are - sinus tachycardia,  - decreased QRS voltage,  - nonspecific ST-T wave changes,   - supraventricular tachyarrhythmias,  - premature ventricular and atrial contractions,  - non-specific T-wave abnormalities and  - QT interval (corrected QT, also known as QTc) prolongation, and  - rarely, sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Arrhythmias appear to be more common in patients with pre-existing abnormalities on baseline ECG.In particular, a prolongation in QT interval may lead to the onset of severe life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, named \u201ctorsades de points\u201d.  QTc  prolongation is an adverse effect also associated with many other drugs including - lorazepam, - methadone, - antihistamines such as terfenadine and astemizole, - antibiotics such as macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole antifungals, and antimalarials are the most well known for prolonging the QT interval. - antidepressants such as Fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline, - antipsychotic agents such as  butyrophenones (haloperidol, droperidol, and pimozide), as well as thioridazine, mesoridazine, and ziprasidone.    There have been many case reports of QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes associated with pentamidine administration in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.  Risk factors for QTc prolongation are, - Congenital long QT syndrome/baseline QT prolongation - Female sex, - Increased age, - Central nervous system disease (e.g., hemorrhage, infection, stroke, tumor, trauma), - Cardiac disease (e.g., atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, congenital heart failure, ischmic heart disease, left ventricular dysfunction), - Renal/hepatic impairment - Electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia) - Metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hyperthyroidism/ hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia) - Altered nutrition (e.g., anorexia nervosa, alcoholism), and - Obesity.  It is recommended that all symptomatic patients should receive treatment. It is also advisable to screen the family members of patients with long QT syndrome. The goal of therapy is to prevent symptoms.   The first choice therapy is beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Beta-blockers effectively prevent cardiac events in approximately 70% of patients, while cardiac events continue to occur despite beta-blocker therapy in the remaining 30%.  Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD): is indicated in patients who have experienced cardiac arrest, particularly if cardiac arrest occurred while already on drug treatment, or who continue to have syncope despite medications.  ICDs will not prevent the occurance of torsades but, will prevent sudden cardiac death when torsades is prolonged or degenerates to ventricular fibrillation. Therefore, for prevention of torsades,  Beta Blockers should be continued after the implantation of the cardioverter-defibrillator.   Left thoracic sympathectomy: This procedure had been mainly been used in  Europe, for patients who were not responding to Beta blockers. Now it has been given way to permanent pacemaker and cardioverter-defibrillator implantation.  In asymptomatic patients also, preventive therapy is indicated. The reason is that it cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy which patient will subsequently have symptoms and which one will not. It is important to remember that 30-40% of sudden deaths occur at the first event.  I hope this information will be of help to you. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Persistent Palpitations",
    "content": "Hi there -- What you describe is infuriatingly common and almost never a cause for concern. It is nice when it can be caught on Holter monitor, but if it is the most common source of palpitations (premature ventricular or atrial contractions, PVCs and PACs) these occur so randomly and can be aggravated by so many innocent things that it's very difficult to know it will happen during a given 24 hour period, so the Holter monitor becomes only about half-useful as proof of what's going on. The good news is if the palpitations are that random they really aren't much of an issue, although the tolerance (emotional) of people can vary tremendously. Nearly all of us have some of these and some of us have them virtually all the time. Some feel them and some don't. If one doesn't feel them they don't even qualify as palpititions, but you do feel them, so you definitely need the reassurance that they are not diagnostic nor are they predictive of anything, even in a clinical setting. That doesn't make them less unpleasant, but knowing they are harmless sometimes is helpful in learning to disregard them.   I hope this answer doesn't sound cavalier, because it isn't intended that way. I'm well aware of the emotional havoc this can cause for some people, and usually it's in part because a clinician fails to adequately explain and reassure the patient. Many doctors either believe they've accomplished this because they are not pressed further by the patient, or simply don't feel it's worth the time. I happen to know it can be worth a good deal of time if it can ease the patient's mind. It is a very nasty sensation at worst, totally imperceptible at best, but it is virtually never of any consequence medically. Only when rapid, sustained palpitation lasting minutes to hours continuously, with other symptoms (lightheadedness, shortness of breath) suggest an irregular or too-fast tachycardia, is further medical exploration or intervention required, and even then half the time (at least) the problem is benign. But simple PVCs and PACs are so common they are almost ubiquitious in the healthy population.  If they are a real bother, avoiding caffeine, managing stress, remembering they occur more often in the evening and after meals and at bedtime all may be useful. Other than that, well, it's like sneezing or hiccups. Honest. :)  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please don't hestitate to follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "At 11 years old my son was seen for a small pea sized bump in his left leg just above his knee (inner thigh area) two years later it is the size of a golf ball currently. Diagnostic testing by an angiogram resulted in entramuscular hemangioma. Treatment was to be performed however; medical could not cover the expense. His left femer is 1/2 inch longer than his right, he has scoliosis, and is now exibiting symptoms of funnel chest and has breathing issues when doing normal activities. Blood test showed white blood cell was a little low, maybe due to a cold but had no symptoms. He had a growth in his neck for about two and a half months and was thought to be lymphoma or non-hogi. des. but the lump in his neck went down enough not to complete a bio-.  My question is, since we discovered the lump in his leg, which he has a level 2 pain almost daily. Could this lump be causing all of the listed things that has been occuring such as the funnel chest, the lump in his neck, and rapid growth to the extent it is causing deformities?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 13yr. w/ entramuscular hemangioma, can it cause funnel chest",
    "content": "Hello -- I think what you mean is intramuscular hemangioma, which is often confused with soft tissue venous malformations (AVMs). The difference is the hemangiomas, while generally benign, can and do cause pain. They are treatable, but of course the expense becomes an issue and if insurance won't cover it, this could be difficult to pay for, even though treatment is relatively simple.   To answer your question, no, the hamangioma is the cause of the other problems, but rather is probably related to whatever is the underlying cause of the various defects, none of which, on its own, is necessarily dangerous, but collectively could well cause a reduction in quality of life for your son. Most of these things can be treated, but must be addressed separately. Some people just seem to be born with a tendency toward progressive defects like these, and they can, in sum, be a pretty big cause of disability if not corrected. The hemangioma is actually probably one of the least important of the collection of problems, except for the pain it causes. It is also probably the least difficult one to treat.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the reply, It does help provide information. Just to update on his situation, he recently went in for an EKG and echocardiogram again and was fine.  The cardio Doctor suggests that it is more of a chest wall issue and no apparent signs it is hurting or obstructing his heart function at this time. However; he does have restricted breathing and cannot participate in activities as a 13 year old would normally. We also discovered that two months ago he was 5'6 now two months later he is 5'8 = 2 inches in 2 months. His chest almost looks like it has a buckling inward effect to it. I read information on line and it don't look like it is a life threatening situation by it self.  We are going in for a geneticts test soon as giantizum could be a factor.  The reason why I asked if the two were related some how was because of the increased blood flow causing his femer on that leg to be longer than the other. I thought perhaps it could cause the rapid growth to be happening in other areas as well as it is on the left side. Hemangioma left leg, longer femar bone, scoliosis, now joint pain in his knee and hip with an indentation on the left of chest wall.  Thank you again for your time. I would appriciate any feedback to the growth issue. I agree the proceedure for the hemangioma was described as a fairly simple one, however; due to our state budget cuts. It seems that insurance will cover diagnosing the problems but will not help to treat it. It is very dissapointing and heartbreaking in that they will help you find out what is wrong but won't help you to treat it. So you have to live knowing what is wrong with you knowing you don't have the money or resources to fix it then stress becomes a factor.\n\n",

Obviously, many of these test came at my request due to my continual discomfort in the left chest and left arm.   Would the test mentioned above 'catch' a aneurysm?  Also, what are your thoughts on 64 Slice CT Scan... are they an effective as a predictor for CAD?

    "title": "Re: Efficacy of 64 Slice CT Scan, XRay and Caridac Echo",
    "content": "Hello -- To take your concerns in order, first the pain may well not be heart-related, but there are some other, more arcane possibilities we'll get to after the main questions: First, you've pretty well ruled out acute coronary syndrome (incipient heart attack), so you're probably in fairly good shape in terms of coronary arteries generally. Your echo and 64-slice CT have been negative as well, which is great. Now the x-ray and echo alone should have ruled out any dilation of the aortic root or ascending aorta, where your concern would be aimed right now, although this of course doesn't preclude an abdominal aneurysm, which would not be causing the current symptoms.   The 64-slice CT has recently been found to be more reliable in predicting CAD than previously believed,and this, in combination with negative stress test, echo, EKG, etc., pretty well does rule out coronary artery disease. What is left could be either a) musculoskeletal chest wall problems unrelated to your heart, b) anxiety/stress-related somatosensory perceived pain, or c) remotely possible it could be due to random spasm of one coronary artery -- something usually seen occurring on a predictable schedule but sometimes happening randomly in association with stress. I doubt this last simply because there were never any EKG anomalies to confirm this possibility. It is sometimes difficult to prove when random-occurring, and often doesn't matter anyway.   I think you've safely eliminated CAD from the picture -- for now. Because of your body mass index (BMI) constitutes obesity, you do carry one risk factor for future heart disease, so working to \"lose a few\" might well be a good idea. You really need to get the BMI down from your current 30.8 to below 24. That's a singular goal for future good health, since everything else currently seems to be in good order.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I was on birth control for about two years. I stopped taking it about 8 months ago due to the heart palpitations and severe headaches. I was advised against taking birth control due to my migraines but since my periods are so debilitating and random, I figured the pros outweighed the cons. I had to switch to 3 or 4 different prescriptions due to migraine recurrences. After a while of being on the pill, I noticed the heart palpitations. I figured I was under stress or it was something in my lifestyle. The palpitations got to the point to where I would get short of breath for a couple of seconds and I would have this crushing pain in my chest. I got scared and stopped taking the pills. The palpitations slowly started going away. I still had some here and there but nothing like they were while I was on the pill. Recently, the palpitations have been giving me problems again. I haven't changed anything and I'm not taking any new medications. Although, I am under a little bit more stress than I am used to but I don't think I'm under enough for it to affect my heart. Could this be a possible blood clot? Could the birth control have done damage to my heart while I was on it? I really don't want to waste money by going to the doctor if it isn't anything to worry about. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Heart Palpitations due to Birth Control",
    "content": "Hi there -- While a possible complication of some forms of hormonal birth control can (rarely) cause heart problems, and while these hormones can also sometimes cause an increase in \"normal\" palpitations, it seems unlikely the pills damaged your heart, and it is even less likely you have developed a clot this long after having stopped the pills, although a clot is a more likely complication than heart injury.   The problem is most people experience premature beats which often result in palpitations being felt -- but this is normal and common. While certain things: medications, caffeine, nicotine, anxiety, stress, digestion, falling asleep, etc., can increase these premature beats, this in itself is not a real problem. However, what you describe as \"crushing\" chest pain is a definite concern and for this reason you should be evaluated to determine just what's causing this -- and what may be causing the palpitations to be stirred up again, even though they generally are harmless and have no diagnostic value of their own, on their own.  Good luck to you. Please get in to see a doctor as soon as you can, and follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  My question is a long one and it is in regards to my Mother. She is 53 and has been active all her life. Since I can remember she has excersised at least 4 hours a day which includes walking, lite weight lifting and dancing. She eats fruits and vegatables, proteins and grains... Pretty much she only eats what the food pyramid says is healthy and she has been doing that for the past 23 years. She has never drunk any alcoholic beverage or smoked. So here is the background on what happened.  About a year ago she injured her left knee, the doctors said it was a stress fracture and so she was off of it for about 8 weeks. After being cleared by the doctors to begin to move around again she noticed that she could no longer walk without a cain. Nor could she move nearly as fast as she had before the injury. Well my mom thought that it was something that would go away with time so about 6 months ago she tried to push herself a little harder(instead of walking for 1 hour at 3 miles an hour she tried to walk for 2 hours at 4 miles an hour. Now she use to be able to walk for 6 or 7 hours straight at 3 or 4 miles an our no problem...) Well when she got home she noticed that her left ankle had swollen to 3 times the normal size of the other one and that her old injury(stress fracture) was aching.  Well since that 6 months ago the knee has stopped aching but the ankle has not. Now around this same time she noticed that any time she started to move around she started to sweat profusely and get out of breath. Well about 2 weeks ago a uncomfortable feeling has been bothering her really bad in the area of her real stomach and heart(by real I mean actual location and not the intestins area). Anytime she starts moving around it feels as if her heart cannot do it and that she may collapse because the blood isn't circulating properly. Her intestin's area has ballooned to where it looks like she is pregnant(hasn't had sex in at least 15 years) though I must mention that her intestins area has been growing no matter what she does for the past 10 years.   My mother has always tried to keep fit and well for the 10 years it seems no matter what she does or doesn't do her body retains water at an alarming rate and that her stomach will not go down.   So my question now that you have some background on my mother is since she seems to have terrible circulation is this serious enough to go into the doctor for? I believe it is but she keeps thinking it will past or her body will be able to fix itself.   Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- While your mother's original injury (the stress fracture) may have caused her to become deconditioned -- which is not at all unsual -- the most recent symptoms seem to have no direct relation to this deconditioning and yes, most definitely they warrant medical evaluation by a doctor. I'm not sure what's going on, especially since the swelling was first noted in the anke of the affected leg, so was likely related in some way to the original injury, the abdominal swelling -- her stomach being so bloated -- is not at all normal and could suggest congestive heart failure, which may have started during her deconditioned state due to the knee problem, but would have shown up eventually anyway, most likely. This is all speculation, however. She really needs to be seen and evaluated to determine what this is. It could be a lot of non-heart-related things, but it does at least fit the possible profile of congestive ehart falure. This needs to be ruled in or out and the true cause determined and treated.  I hope this helps. Good luck to you both. Please keep us updated here.\n\n",

    "title": "Diastolic Dysfunction on ECG - Should I be worried?",
    "content": "I am a 27 year old female that has been basically sedentary for five years due to complications of PCOS. In May of this year I started losing weight, and I have lost 12lbs a month since then to bring my weight down to 160lbs. I had hypertension and tachycardia for most of the past five years, until May. Since August, I have been battling severe iron deficiency anemia due to menorrhagia and reduced stomach acid inhibiting my iron absorption. I take Prevacid twice a day to treat a hiatal hernia.   I had an Echocardiogram performed in August in the hospital, and was told it was normal. However, I received a copy of the report this week, and apparently there is evidence of diastolic dysfunction. \"Tissue Doppler Imaging - left ventricular diastolic function assessment: Doppler interrogation of mitral inflow reveals E:A reversal compatible with diastolic relaxation abnormality, diastolic dysfunction.\" There are no other abnormalities listed on the ECG and my EF is in the range of 60%.   Is this something I should worry about? What can cause it?  Lately, I have been waking up in the mornings feeling out of breath, and my pulse is always higher in the mornings. At rest, my pulse is typically around 80, but when I walk even a little bit it races to 100-110. I assumed that this is from the anemia, since I had these symptoms since the onset of my menorrhagia, but now I am worried that they are caused by heart problems.  Also, generally I lose weight throughout the day, weighing the least right before dinner. Can the diastolic dysfunction cause these symptoms? Am I at risk for heart failure? Is there anything I should be doing to correct the diastolic dysfunction? I had a lung scan that showed no fluid in the lungs, does that rule out any kind of heart failure?  I have also had my thyroid functions checked and they are normal. Thank you in advance for any advice you can provide.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- First of all congratulations on the very impressive weight loss and control of DM! That's a huge accomplishment and you are well on your way to being a whole lot healthier and happier. Good job!  The echocardiogram shows a rather mild systolic sluggishness that is, in all probability, due to metabolic changes (due to anemia and DM) and a formerly sedentary lifestyle leading to deconditioning. It should be followed in maybe six months, but is not an unusual finding for someone with your history, and as you become healthier and more fit it may well normalize. The fact you were told it was \"normal\" was no doubt placed in the context of your overall health and history. It's certainly not alarming, but any medical report has to include any deviation from the \"blueprint\" we are supposed to match in the textbook definition of \"normal.\"   All in all you sound like an increasingly healthy 27 year old woman who is making remarkable progress toward a goal of total health. The echo finding, when repeated, will likely either be the same or more nearly normal, and as long as your doctor finds it \"normal\" it's fine,because it really is unremarkable.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck, keep up the good work, and please stay in touch with us here.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Abnormal EKG with ST and T waves",
    "content": "HI there -- I think I can supply a few salient facts that should hopefully reassure you and make you feel better about this. First, in anxious people the EKG is a sensitive indicator of anxiety, almost always exhibiting flipped T-waves. These are not deeply inverted as in ischemic heart disease, and are non-specific. Couple this fact with this one: EKG machines are programmed to recognize a large number of abnormalities and to note them, but the machine has no clue as to context, and doctors almost never rely on the machine's auto-interpretation that prints out with the tracing. I personally would love to see this feature disabled, but some nursing staff have to rely on this to notify a doctor of something they also don't understand. The doctor then looks at the actual EKG, especially in context of the situation. Non-specific T-wave inversions alone are seen very commonly in anxious patients, and even without anxiety they occur fairly often. They don't mean much of anything unless coupled with other things you definitely have not had. The cardiac enzymes being normal counts for a lot more. The rest of your EKG was just fine -- according to the machine, which will comment on just about everything but the way you fix your hair. The ST-T abnormalities, coupled with chest pain, require further rule out owing to common sense protocols which must be followed, but you passed with flying colors. People with anxiety problems and panic disorder show up more often than others in the ER, and this is fine, really, because people with those problems can also get sick. Hopefully over time you'll learn to differentiate between what seem to be alarming physical symptoms and those typical of anxiety and panic, but it's no easy trick and it does take a while. Good news is it can be done. Meanwhile, even though you've had this happen and been told (correctly) that you had nothing serious going on, I would never tell you or anyone with anxiety or PD to simply \"ignore\" symptoms when you're not certain what's causing them. Chances are they're extranious or even anxiety-caused, but don't assume that.   Short answer is your anxiety problem -- which is very serious in its own right due to its ability to mimic serious disorders and disrupt your enjoyment of life -- was a red herring this time, and is likely to be on future occasions too, but by all means let a medical person determine this for you.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed and good luck to you!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Heart Beat throughout body - strange sensation",
    "content": "Hi Garrett -- This is a fairly common complaint and is often related to stress or simply being overly aware of one's normal body functions. However, sometimes this pulsing all over can actually be due to either some abnormal (but harmless) dilation of the blood vessels (sometimes due to a \"nightcap\") and sometimes also can be felt in people with elevated blood pressure. If you have a means of checking your blood pressure at night or just at any time as a baseline, this could rule this one problem out or in. Beyond that there's little that would be of medical concern, although stress can lead to anxiety and preoccupation with trivial sensations otherwise not usually noticed. Most of the time this particular complaint amounts to nothing, but elevated blood pressure should be ruled out, and if you do have a drink late in the evening in order to help sleep this could also cause this sensation -- and disturb sleep as well (and if you were sleeping really well you'd probably not notice this particular phenomenon anyway. Stress then pushes to the front as a possible culprit.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

I was diganosed with anxiety and I do not currently take medications for it. I know the difference between my panic attacks and the pain in my chest  and it is very concerning and seems to happen multiple time throughout the day now.  It comes completely randomly and sometimes its sharp or mild soreness. It happens even when I am resting and has caused a lot of restless nights.   I have been to the hospital a few times and they always dismiss it as an axiety attack. I also recently went to visit my doctor for a cold and my blood pressure was 160/80 on the left side and 140/70 on the other. He told me to come back in a month to retake it and see if it is the cold and cold medicines causing the spike. He also suspected my birth control which is Yaz, which I also stopped and started using an external form of birth control. I used to be extremely athletic exercising at least an hour a day, and for the past year stopped  and gained a little but of weight.  I am nervous and concerned that all these symptoms are related. Should I see a cardiologist or just talk more with my primary doctor? And should I be concerned?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 19 y/o F with consistent chest pain",
    "content": "Hi there -- Whatever is causing the chest pains it's not likely your heart. First, this pain obviously isn't worsened by exertion, since you seem to tolerate exercise well, and besides that heart pain is almost never sharp, never causes tenderness upon pressure, is never highly localized, and is almost never felt on the left side. However, there are two possibilities and one, oddly enough, is actually anxiety, which is known to cause tetany and subsequent muscle pain in the left chest in some patients. More likely, though, because of the tenderness upon manual pressure, this may be costochondritis (Tietz's syndrome), inflammation of the connective tissue between the ribs and where they connect to the sternum. This can become chronic, can be caused by athletic workouts, repetitive motion lifting, or even something viral. It almost always responds well to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs such as ibuprofin (as Advil) or naproxyn (as Aleve), but sometimes can be persistent. It is not in any way life-threatening nor related to the heart and is a superficial but often quite painful problem and can be re-aggravated.   Anxiety actually is one other possible culprit. Sounds funny, I know, but this is classic for chronic generalized anxiety and can really confuse the picture. It's worth considering, but first try an OTC pain med like naproxyn (Aleve) and see if that doesn't help relieve it.   The unequal blood pressure readings may have been due to a bad ear or noisy surroundings. It should be rechecked, as this can be a significant sign pointing to something unrelated to your chest pain, but if the pressures are consistently that far apart then you'd need to have at least an ultrasound study or CT of the chest to see if there may be coarctation of the aorta (a congenital narrowing of the main blood vessel carrying blood away from the heart). This is unlikely as it is fairly rare, but if present can cause problems and should be ruled out -- IF the BP continues to show up markedly unequal. If it was a freak reading a repeat should easily settle this issue.   The chest pain isn't coronary in nature. Most likely it's due to one (or both) of the factors mentioned above.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "title": "Hyperthyroid/Left Bundle Branch Block",
    "content": "I am 63-years old with no previous history of serious illness other than a complete hysterectory over twenty years ago and slight arthritis in my knees.  My husband has had two open heart surgeries so we take our blood pressure at home quite frequently.  Several weeks ago I noticed my ordinarily perfect blood pressure was rising very slightly and my pulse was strangely high.  I attributed the change to stress and sleep deprivation at that particular time.  When my numbers continued to rise, I got worried and went to a doctor.  By then I was feeling lethargic fatigue like nothing I'd ever known in my life and I was becoming deeply depressed.  My doctor said I'd been O.K. a year ago, my lab numbers had been good, etc., but when she did an EKG, she said I had Left Bundle Branch Block.  She made an appointment for me to see a cardiologist and scheduled routine lab work.  I ended-up seeing the cardiologist one day after getting my lab results back - they showed I was hyperthyroid.  The cardiologist said my LBBB might be connected to the hyperthyroidism and for me to finish a couple of other thyroid tests and then he'd do some heart tests.  I had a nuclear thyroid scan and ultrasound.  The results showed small nodules on my thyroid but the doctor said she didn't believe my symptoms were related to hyperthyroidism.  She almost became angry when I said I'd been researching hyperthyroidism online and fatigue was always a symptom.  She totally disagreed and seemed to lose interest in treating me - she said I should return to the cardiologist because fatigue, elevated blood pressure/pulse and slight pain in my neck were womens' symptoms of heart disease, not hyperthyroidism.  I have waited almost a month but next week I will have a \"nuclear\" stress test and echocardiogram.  At this point, I am now so fatigued that I'm wondering how I'll be able to do a stress test but I guess the cardiologist will understand.  It's hard for me to even get a bath and get dressed without feeling totally exhausted.  I am having major palpitations now, often feel faint, cannot do much of anything really.  I feel like my normal life has stopped because of such intense fatigue.  In the research I've done, in all sincerity my symptoms match HYPOTHYROID more than hyperthyroid...almost without exception.  Is it possible that hyperthyroid can somehow be mistaken for hypothyroidism?    Also, do you think LBBB can be the reason for the thyroid symptoms?  I feel like I am being totally misdiagnosed but I'm looking forward to the heart tests.  The cardiologist seemed so sure that my LBBB was caused by hyperthyroidism but my internal medicine doctor seems just as convinced that it's the other way around.    Thank you for any advice or information you can share.  I'm so totally frustrated and want so desperately to feel well again.  I care for my 88-year old mother and I need to get my strength and stamina back.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hyperthyroid/Left Bundle Branch Block",
    "content": "Hello -- This post calls for several conclusions. First, you may need to change doctors because you have encountered one who is deeply bothered by patients who insist in being their own advocate. This is something that's changing and will continue to change,but there will remain some doctors who resent the patient getting involved in the detective work -- and sometimes they are justified, but it doesn't sound like this is the case with you at all. There are also doctors who really appreciate informed patients, because they can help the process move forward and will mention things other people might never think to mention. So there's that.  You're also correct in that your symptoms do sound a good deal more like hypo- rather than hyperthyroidism, and sometimes, early in thyroid disease the two can become confused or even change back and forth before one assumes the dominant role.   That being said -- and it does need following up because the nodules are there and most certainly could be involved in this business -- your having LBBB is not all that likely to be caused by either hyer or hypthyroidism, and it does often show up in relation to other heart issues which can cause the sort of symptoms of which you're complaining, so this does need to be followed also. Your doctor is correct about that part, but not in the attitude toward your invovement in your own healthcare. My opinion only, but I tend to think my opinions through pretty thoroughly and have been in the business a long time. The LBBB is worrisome (unlike RBBB) and there are a number of potentially related heart issues which do need to be ruled out as the underlying cause, even as the thyroid problem, whichever it is, also gets followed. While you do need to be followed by the cardiologist, you might be able to avoid an awkward pass with your doctor by arranging a consult with an endocrinologist to work out exactly what's going on in the thyroid department. If your internist is required by your health insurance to issue referrals you may have to either self-refer or as I've suggested, perhaps change internists. This is too serious to just brush off half of what's already been demonstrated to be present (the thyroid issue). If this is causing the LBBB (something possible but not that likely) then great, you'll get the thyroid issue managed and that will go away. If, however, they are two separate issues (comorbidity is the term used for what I call the Horrible Coincidence Phenomenon), they both need to be managed, and you'll need a sympathetic internist or GP to quarterback the care by the specialists.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please do keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- From the sound of your symptoms you do not have any life-threatening problems. While I cannot, of course, prove this in cyberspace, I can tell you what you describe is all generally very common in the healthy population and each issue separately is almost always benign. You could possible have something called mitral valve prolapse (MVP), which is in itself almost always benign and is so common it is often called a \"variant of normal.\" However it can cause an increase in the frequency of palpitations (also very common and normal in the healthy population) and is sometimes accompanied by a click murmur. Finding of a murmur with no explanation is one of the greatest errors made my physicians, and can be infuriating because most such murmurs are totally innocent and meaningless. However, since it was noted it needs to be explained or followed up with a cardiological workup, which would serve as a reassurance to you while ruling out any possible obscure structural problem. MVP is often associated with a \"click\" murmur which is peculiar to the syndrome. It is harmless. RBBB is also harmless and almost never diagnostic of anything. It occurs in many normal hearts. It can make a funny-looking EKG tracing, but that's about it. The palpitations you've been having are common and generally are meaningless, but can be very upsetting if not explained properly. It would seem your doctor missed every chance to reassure you, which is disturbing to say the least. A meaningless murmur, palpitations, and a meaningless RBBB noted -- and incomplete at that -- area all findings that, if mentioned at all, should be explained as almost always totally benign. I would, at most suggest you request both an explanation of these findings and perhaps an echocardiogram to rule out -- or in -- MVP, which would only serve, if MVP is present, to reassure you that there's something but it's harmless. If it's not present and nothing else is found (which is the most likely outcome) then you would still feel reassurance. Either way the odds are there's nothing significant going on at all, and certainly no suggestion of anything that would result in cardiac arrest, although with the ham-handed way your doctor delivered his findings you are definitely entitled to a clarification and perhaps that echocardiogram, and I would insist on both. Meanwhile I think you can safely relax and, if the palpitations become truly disturbing or annoying there are medications that can reduce their frequency, but it's best if this can be avoided. In short, everything sounds well within normal limits, with a possible benign condition that rarely requires any treatment at all.   Hope this helps. Good luck to you and please do follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 47 year old male, fairly active, non smoker, non drinker. In the last few months I have become increasingly more fatigued after normal activities and noticed left arm and chest pain. My arm would feel tight around my elbow and forearm and my hand would tingle. The pain in my chest would be a sharp stabbing pain. On a scale of 1 -10 I would say it was a 6. My blood pressure was also shooting up, despite my meds. (186/123 one night) I went to my doc with a sharp pain in my right back, around where my gall bladder used to be, this pain went away after a few days. My doc ordered a cat scan and a consult with a cardiologist. The cat scan reviled a possible perricadial effusion and a pluarl effision in my right lung. I then had a positive stress test and was scheduled for a heart cath. I had the heart cath which was fine. My arteries were fine with no blockage noted. Back in 2005 I had the same thing happen, but with no arm or chest pain. My blood pressure was higher than normal, I would get out of breath very easily and I was extemely fatigued. I had the same test performed, negative stress test but one of the scans showed a possible blockage of one of my renial arteries. I had a anigram performed which was negative. Over a few weeks I started to feel better and my blood pressure came back down. I have an extensive family history of heart failure and a older sister who has lupus.  This doesnt seem to be heart related, but I know that something is wrong with me. I don't know which way to turn.\n\n",

    "content": "While coronary artery disease does seem to have been ruled out the symptoms do sound like some sort of heart-related problem, perhaps only something like spiking blood pressure due to the renal problem. I'm not certain from your post if you had an angiogram of the heart only, heart and kidneys or heart and kidneys, but if either heart of kidneys was left out of the combination it would need to be followed up. I suspect this may be a renal-mediated problem affecting the heart indirectly, but it's only a guess. A cardiolgist and urologist need to work in concert to ultimately figure this out. A good primary care \"quarterback\" physician should manage the consults and coordinate the detective work and any followup care.  I don't think you have an immediate risk looming over you, but I do suspect something is not right somewhere, and instinct -- not science -- suggest to me this may be a renal problem.   Good luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (diagnosed in 2002) and was diagnosed in February with Lupus. I am not sure that I agree with the Lupus diagnosis right now. But, I have a hard time expressing that to my doctor. Other tests have not been done to rule out other issues that can be misdiagnosed as Lupus (I have been reading a lot on the subject). Could Lupus explain these blood and lab results and are there other things that could cause these results? What are the issues that I should be concerned about on the echo & holter? Could these be Lupus related?  I have been sick for a long time and have went down many dead end roads with different doctors - numerous putting me on antidepressants and labeling my problems as stress. I have fatigue that is almost indescribable, numbness (especially in my face and arms), strange sensations, vertigo and balance problems, headaches and pressure in my head, I have problems with my blood pressure dropping - the lowest was 78/54 - when this happens I get really pale (white as a sheet of paper) and feel really weak and weird and my pulse rate usually drops as well. I also have problems with my heart rate going up. I have been struggling for so long and I am now unable to work or even care for myself. I need some answers and any help that would help me to get to the bottom of this problem or help me to get the care that I need would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much for your time!!!

    "content": "Hi there --  First to address your echocardiogram findings: the part which addresses the observations and findings describe an essentially normal and structurally healthy heart with nothing remarkable turning up. The long list of specific measurements would take far more room to explain than we have here, but I've looked at them and they all simply confirm the express written findings which, again, are all within normal limits. No problems there.   Regarding the Holter results, the only thing of any significance which showed up is the fact that you have occasional premature atrial and ventricular heartbeats, something for which there is no longer a true \"normal\", since we all have these from time to time, and some of us have huge numbers of them while others have only very occasional ones, and of course there are variations among all subjects as well, depending on various factors that influence premature beats. The number that showed up on  your tracing falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum but are still of no clinical significance.   Since you suffer from Hashimoto's disease and other autoimmune problems, it is fairly likely your lupus panel finding is suggestive of some degree of lupus, but is not the  last word on this, since it is difficult to diagnose many cases of lupus based on this alone. Lupus would not at all explain your relatively good echo and Holter findings, and nothing else showed up there, so there's no current corellation between possible lupus and any cardiological problem, since there are no cardiac problems exposed by those exams. Your blood work, while generally negative, does contain some suggestion of autoimmune problems, which would follow, since you at the least have Hashimoto's.   I hope this helps clarify things for you. Your heart currently is quite healthy, but you would appear to have autoimmune issues, and lupus may be one of them. Please feel free to follow up with  us here as necessary. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 28 y/o, white, male, 6'4\" 240lbs and starting last October (2008), I began having chest pain.  My doctor said it might be heartburn or something more serious so I should take antacid and go have a stress test done.  I was scheduled for my stress test in December but cancelled it because I wanted to give the anacids a little more time (and I was worried what they might find).  In March (2009), my symptoms increased.  Instead of \"just\" chest pain, I now began feeling my heart beating in my chest and in my neck.  I also began getting really dizzy and lightheaded (even from walking up one flight of stairs).  I rescheduled my stress test and finished it last week.  My doctor called me the next day and told me that I have an Aortic Root Dilation and an Aortic Aneurysm.  She stated that she was not very familar with the norms and my results but did know I was close to when they would start talking about doing sometype of surgery.  I got a copy of the stress test results but I have no idea what it means.  I have looked all over on the internet but I am hoping that someone can help me understand what would be considered normal with these measurements.  If I have a better understanding as to what is wrong, I believe I can be better prepared for my appointment with the cardiologist next week.  I do not know a lot about my father or grandfather but I do know that they both suffered from heart issues.  I have two kids and both of them have pulmonary stenosis (my son has a moderate version and my daughter has a mild version).

    "content": "Hi there --  Based upon measurements alone, you would be classified as having an ascending aortic aneurysm, as well as abnormal aortic room dimensions. All other measurements are reasonable for your height and weight, but height and weight, in this case, also figure in, along with the valvular abnormalities in your children, strongly suggest you either have a familial genetic structural heart issue, or perhaps you have (based on height alone) Marfan syndrome.  One of the very common complications of Marfan's is dilation of aortic root and any portion of the aorta, as well as specifically the proximal ascending aorta, which is where you do appear to have a statistically verifiable, though not remarkably large, aneurysm.   Now then: there are two criteria for surgical intervention in these situations. One is size (and growth rate) of aneurysm. You probably wouldn't qualify under that criteria as yet. However, there is the second criteria, which is symptoms, and your symptoms probably do qualify you for surgical intervention. What you describe may well herald a dissection of proximal aortic aneuryms and root,  and you need to stay close to a first class surgical intervention facility until this is clarified and a treatment plan initiated. You will be seeing a cardiogist who very likey will refer you to a cardiothoracic or vascular surgeon to decide if urgent or emergent repair of the aneurysm is appropriate now (and it seems likely it will be necessary eventually if not now). If, at any time in the meanwhile your symptoms  should increase or you should experience any significant chest pain and espcially a tearing sensation in your chest or throat, you must dial 9-1-1 and get yourself to an emergency medical facility at once, as this would indicate dissection and imminent rupture, which, to put not too fine a point on it, is not something you want.   Since this has evolved slowly over a period of months I'm expecting you'll be able to see your cardiologist as scheduled, and this will be very helpful in sorting out what needs to be done next. In the meantime please fololow up with us here as needed, and keep us updated as well. Good luck to you.\n\n",

You (along with the doctor (who is a cardiologist) who read my stress echo) stated that I have an Aortic Root Dilation and an ascending aortic aneurysm, however the cardiologist I seen yesterday (a partner of the one who read the stress echo) said I have a very minimal aortic root dilation and no aneurysm.  I realize that, like all areas of medicine, things are subjective.  Could you tell me why you believe I have an aortic root dilation and an ascending aortic aneurysm?  What measurements (in my results above) makes you believe this and what would be considered the \u201cnorm\u201d for those measurements?  At my request, the cardiologist yesterday ordered a CT of the Aorta for tomorrow.  I believe that should give me a better understanding as to what is going on.  Thank you for your time and your response!  Troy\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 28 y/o Male - Aortic Root Dilation / Aortic Aneurysm",
    "content": "Hi Troy, I'll do my best to explain my view of this. Unfortunately much of it can be subjective, and some doctors do use the patient's size and weight to create a relative standard for judging these things (you're a good sized guy, and this theory of relative organ dimensions is not unreasonable). Based on the measurements alone, your aortic root diameter is substantially larger than normal, and, since it is above 4 cm is considered, by the numbers, to be dilated. Same thing hold true for the ascending aorta, although the rule for intervention here is more subjective yet, depending on possible underlying causes such as Marfan syndrome and whether or not the patient is symptomatic. As I am only able to go by the numbers -- can't make a subjective evaluation of your build vs. structural heart dimensions in a setting like this, at a distance, I'd read the report as positive for root dilatation and an early ascending aneurism. It  is a doctor's job to determine if symptoms warrant anything beyond just following this and observing, but based on the numerical values you technically would be diagnosed by the numbers. Again, there are those doctors (and as I said, this is not unreasonable) who will take into consideration total body type and size in judging this, as well as the aortic valve and artery itself compared with overall heart size (which appears to be normal).  Normal aortic root diameter is 2-3 cm, but of course may be greater in a much larger than average person. Still, 4.3 is significantly broader. Your ascending aorta was measured using the formula of ascending aortic diameter divided by body surface area, it appears, and that is correct the numbers place you in the highest of the three risk groups for aneurysm. However, this same formula can be used to mitigate severity of aneurysm subjectively. Again, this comes down to absolute numbers. Also I note the M-mode measurement is much smaller than the doppler measurment computed as above. This means there could easily be a disparity in findings between two doctors. Since the two who've read your results are in the same practice one would expect them to compare notes and come to some sort of agreement in what to tell you. I'd definitely call them on this, since you're getting two answers. Finally, the CT should clarify things a great deal and may possibly help bring the two differing opinions together.  I certainly hope so. Please let us know how this turns out.\n\n",

    "content": "Mr. Kenyon-  Thank you for your response.  I appreciate your wiliness to communicate your views and the rational for your views with me.  I believe the more information you have on the front end, the better decisions you can make down the road.  I do have good news however.  The CTA of the aorta shows no aneurysm!  I was very pleased to learn this however; the cardiologist I am seeing seems a little too laid back for me.  He said that although my Ao Root diameter is 4.5cm (on my echo it was 4.3cm (2+ weeks ago) so I do not know if the CTA provided a new measurement or what) he is not concerned about it.  He said he does not worry about them until they reach 6-7cm.    My concern is that the symptoms I am having might be related to my Ao Root being 4.5cm.  If he says that he does not do anything until it gets to be 6-7cm then how bad will my symptoms be at that point?  I am not sure if he is saying this to calm me down or what, but he would like to monitor it with an echo.  While this course of action seems somewhat reasonable to me, because I am symptomatic, I worry that the symptoms will only get worse.  I know you stated that an average Ao Root is 2-3cm but could you tell me what is the range when they typically only want to monitor the Ao Root (i.e. 3-4.5cm), when they talk about treatment / repair (i.e. 4-5.5cm) and/or when they say urgent / emergency repair is needed (i.e. > 7cm)?  If you could provide any insight or things I should discuss with my doctor, I would greatly appreciate it!  As always, thank you for your time and your response!  Troy\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  The good news is you've exhausted the entire battery of cardiological tests and have ruled out heart problems as a possible cause. While you've had an endoscopy as well, it is possible it could have missed a sliding hiatal hernia, which, if in place, would look normal. It has to be caught up and out of place. Did you have pain during all the tests? I get the impression the pain is pretty much non-stop. Are there breaks in it or at least times when it is less severe?   Another possibility besides sliding hiatal hernia is esophageal spasm, which also might not show up during endoscopy, simply because you are then sedated and everything is relaxed. This is a problem that can happen  without there being any obvious physical injury being evident. It is sometimes a nerve issue, and of course this also could be nerve pain, perhaps irritation of the phrenic nerve.   If there is a silver lining to any of this it is not only have you ruled out heart disease completely but have also quit smoking, so congratulations on that. I think a consult or follow up with a GI specialist, and from there, if nothing shows up, to a neurologist to rule out a nervous system issue such as inflammation of the phrenic nerve (do you by any chance suffer from occasional hicupping?).   This is what I can offer thus far. If you have any addional information to share it might help.  I hope this is at least some use to you. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

A few times they put this down to low potassium as it hit 2.3 with 3 potassium infussions bags it turned normal 3.4. All blood test for heart damage have come back clear. I have calcified plaque in the lining of my aorta and they have given me Nitrolinguel Pump Spray, Which helps a bit when it gets severe they give me the same thing but under my toungue in tablet form sorry i don't know the name, they also give me asprin and oxygen which brings it down to about a 3-4 on the pain scale! I have a appointment for a holter monotor on the 25th of May. But the pain is always there and i don't know what could be the problem the doctors think im a mystery and i so sick of having to go to the hospital.

    "title": "Re: Reacurring Chest Pain 16 yr old",
    "content": "Hello --  Well  there's certainly something going on. I have an idea or two, but first, let me ask you a couple questions. First, does correcting your potassium (K) level help alleviate the pain? This is significant, as is where the K is going. There has to be a reason for the chronically low K  levels and this could be a factor in the pain. Also, have there been any abnormalities on your EKG other than ectopic beats (which are basically normal)? The calcified plaque in your aorta is not exactly unusual, but at your age it is surprising. I suspect you may have a metabolic problem with salts that is causing a number of things to act up, based on the calcification and low K.   One more question: do you know  what any of your blood pressure readings age been during this ordeal? Especially in the ER?  So this pain is present at all times? Does it get worse at certain times, or is it fairly severe all the time? I'm also thinking, based in part on the suspicion of a metabolic problem, that you may be having spasm of a coronary artery (caused by the body's faulty metabolism of calcium) and there is a way of testing for this. Also you may have an anomalous artery that needs to be relaxed in some  way. Since you appear to have sustained no heart damage this could be the case. The Holter monitor may be helpful,  but a stress test with nuclear scan as well as echocardiogram would be a lot more helpful in sorting this out. One other thing: although you are only a light smoker, this may be helping to trigger the problem, so if you can do it, it would be helpful, at least as an experiment, if you could go a few days reducing the number of cigarettes or just stopping altogether for a few days, to see if this makes a difference.   I hope this is helpful. I don't think you should be classified as a mystery at all. Since the pain responds to nitroglycerine there's almost certainly some  sort of coronary blockage or more likely spasm. This could be visualized on nuc scan  with stress test. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed and keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Thankyou  In reply to your questions my bloodpressure is normal 140 on 60 sometimes lower with the GTN spray.  The first 3 times it was the potassium levels been low and with the infusions the pain ressolved. But in the last 10 or so times my potassium has been normal 3.0 - 3.6.  There has only been a few times where there has been ectopic beats on the EKG otherwise it is normal but with tachycardia! The pain is there all the time but not as severe as when i go to the ER its normally sitting on a 4 or 5 on the pain scale and i call the ambulance when it hits a 10. On some occasions the GTN spray relives the pain but then sometimes it doesnt. The attacks occur doing various activities from sleeping to strenuous exercise. Im sick of going to the hospital and them finding nothing its getting to the point where im not going to go anymore. Should i keep going to the hospital or should i just ignore it? Could it lead to something more serious such as a heart attack? Im not under any stress and im generally happy when the 'attacks' come on! I don't think there related to stress.  When i go to the doctors next what tests should i ask for to check my metabolic levels? Thanks Lynda\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  Given your significant medical history the changes in your echo report are very subtle and trivial, within the range of chance we normally see from one time to the next. There is nothing there that raises any red flags, especially in light of your history. The left atrial dilation is an extremely common finding and probably is of little to no significance. Since you do have significant medical issues it is wise to continue to have at least annual followup echos, if not every six months, but so far I see nothing exciting. If changes progress beyond this point then there might be some cause for concern, but there's no reason to assume this will be the case, since we tend to see some up-and-down in the measurements from one test to the next as a rule. Almost no one's are rock steady, ever.  I hope  this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "i,  Let me start with introducing myself. I am an Indian male 32yrs old  177Cms (5\u2019 10\u201d )tall and a 74 Kgs ( 163pounds)  with a BMI of 23.6. A Year back I started having Chest pains clubbed with Burping. I did not mind that a lot. After a month my Brother \u2013in-law got an Heart attack at the age of 36 and this scared me and I got an Master health check up done and it revealed a T wave inversion ( in one of the inferior leads ) and I went for follow \u2013 up Tread mill Test and ECHO . Both came out to be good . So the cardiologist told me that nothing to worry. But the incidence which happened to my brother in law made me worry about the T wave inversion . So I went for CT Angiogram and that came out with \u201cNormal Study \u201c with no problems.  My cardiologist send me to GI and an endoscopy was done . It revealed a \u201cSevere inflamed esophagus\u201d . I was treated with omeprozole. This happened by last May , even after taking this medicine the pain used to come on and off. Once when there was bad burning sensation in my chest so I rushed to an ER where they took and ECG and that came with the T wave inversion. (Incidentally I checked a master health report which I took in 2003 and that also had the same T wave inversion ) . They ordered TROP I test and CKMD test . TROP I said it is 0.00 and CKMD came in normal range. So they said its only the GERD with is acting on me . Even tough the logic says to me that its nothing to do with the heart  , every time I get the burning sensation I get anxious.  Every time I get that burning sensation it will either be followed by a burp or passing Gas . There will be pain or burning sensation in the chest (mostly on the upper part of the chest ) (sometimes pain in the neck , ear and arms  ) . This gets subsided by either passing of Gas or taking an Antacid. This normally happened before food and just after food. Now a days this happens in the evenings also. Some days this pain continues the whole days. In the scale of 10 I would say the pain is 3-4 . Even though is not very bad pain, since it\u2019s in the chest area it makes me very anxious. Because of this I started exercising at least 3-4 days a week (walk in the treadmill for 30 \u2013 45 min at the speed of 6-7 Km/hr ( 4-4.2 miles/hr). When I exercise / walk this pain comes but does not increase in intensity as I do the exercise and 80 -90% of the days it starts in the 2or 3rd minute goes away when  it go on and do the exercise in the 15th or 20th minute , but this pain has never made me short of breath. During my walk in the treadmill I release a lot of Gas.  I have tried checking my exercise capacity my working out at 160 -170 bpm for a minute and then stop and check the pulse rate after a min rest. This will normally be 115-120 bpm.  I have stopped eating meat and I have only seafood (twice a week) and veggie and reduced my weight from 80kg to 74kilos in last 12 months. I did this because my doctor told reducing weight will help getting rid of GERD. But i still have this pain , but definetly lot less than what i had 10 months back.  With the symptoms of getting the pain in the chest and going to my arms, should I be worried for cardiac problems? This makes me very anxious, this anxiety is increasing my GERD, and this is becoming a vicious cycle.   Also to check for cardiac problems is it a good idea to get an ECHO and Tread mill test every year or would you recommend anything else.  My numbers look as below Blood test Results Haemoglobin \u2013 15.4 gm/dl WBC - 5200/cumm  Lipid Profile Results  Sr. Cholesterol - 174 mg/dl  - This was 204 6 months back  Sr. Triglycerides - 160 mg/dl  - This was 190 6 months back Sr. HDL - 44 mg/dl   - This was 34 6 months back Sr. LDL - 116.6 mg/dl   Blood Pressure Results  ( I normally make a note of BP from my digital meter( OMRON brand), this is the average value for a month)  Avg - Systolic -118 Avg - Diastolic-76 Heart rate - Avg \u2013 73 with resting as 59   Thanks and Regards, kalai\n\n",

    "title": "Re: T wave inversion",
    "content": "Hello Kalai --  After reading your post carefully I think there are several things probably working to make you feel this anxiety. First, there was the fact that someone close to you and quite young had a heart attack. Now if this had been a blood relative, that would be a serious cause for concern, since these things (early onset heart disease) tend to run in families. But This fellow was not a blood relative. It's unnerving, but must be kept in perspective. These things will happen near us sometimes.  Then there is that one persistent inverted T-wave. This is actually a very common abnormality, and when it is not deeply inverted (merely \"flipped\" is the usual term) and occurs in only one lead, it is usually just an idiosyncrasy of that person and many have things like that. Usually it means nothing. Of course you also have something causing chest discomfort, so again this brings up doubts. Now what you describe in terms of chest pain is classic for GERD complicated by unconscious swallowing of air, which is probably the reason for the continual belching. Anxiety will cause this, a side effect of deep sighing, often an unconscious effect of anxiety and worry. Also, GERD itself, depending on its mechanism, may sometimes cause EKG abnormalities, which again are essentially meaningless.   It would probably benefit you to have a nulear scan stress test, next best thing to an unwarrented (at this time) angiogram. Stress echo would be next best after the nuc scan option. Any of these should help put your mind at ease with a negative finding. Now during your initial stress test with echocardiogram you had no chest pain, correct? But in the  gym you do, after a few minutes, and then after a few more minutes if you continue it resolves. This is called \"walking through\" the pain and makes it very unlikely to be cardiac related, but all the more likely to be related to GERD, which is aggravated both by treadmill and other automated exercises, and which is turn is likely to exacerbate deep brerathing (on the treadmill).  My best suggestion would be to have one Stress echo or stress test with scan done to help ease your mind and then if negative, to let this go and treat the GERD and watch your breathing habits, as this can be very insidious and can cause much of the discomfort you've been feeling.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been experiencing chest pain off and on for the last year. I have seen two doctors about it. Both of them are family doctors, not specialists. They both gave me an EKG and the first doctor gave me an x-ray. They both said they were fine. I am getting worried because it hasn't gone away. It doesn't hurt a lot, it just scares me.  It first started occurring last March. The pain felt like it was in my lower right side of heart. The second doctor gave me Naproxen (500 mg) and said I might have pulled something or the cartilage between my ribs might be irritated. I thought nothing of it, and assumed it was like a sore muscle and would go away. It hasn't though.   The pain has turned into a stabbing feeling, which occasionally varies a few inches from the lower left of my heart. No numbness occurs in any part of my body after this. Last week I had bright red blood in my stool for about two days and it has stopped (don't know if this has to do with anything).   The second doctor suggested it could be from Vyvanse, it is a stimulant (pro-drug for ADHD), I did not know I wasn't supposed to drink any caffeine while I was one it (like most Americans I drink at least a soda or two a week). I was getting heart palpitations and I told the second doctor about this, which is when I figured out the caffeine and the stimulant were the cause of heart palpitations. Since then, the palpitations have stopped and only occur when I eat or drink something with caffeine in it. I used to be very active in high school and my first year of college. I have since then stopped because of the demanding work load. I am 5'-9\" and about 130-135 [lbs].  I don't know if Vyvanse is the cause because the chest pain does not go away when I stop taking it.   The pain is occurring once every few days, as it has been for the last year. My mother said she thinks it is the Vyvanse, but I do not want to get off of it if I don't have to. It has impoved my life greatly and is the only non-addictive drug available for people with ADHD. I am also in college so I am at a stressful point in my life. Last February I had to go to the ER twice because I developed stress related hives.  I don't know what this is. I am probably too young for it to be anything very serious (I hope). Any input would be helpful. Thanks so much!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Female 21, Re-occuring Chest Pain, EKG anf X-Ray Normal",
    "content": "Hello --  The pain you describe doesn't sound like cardiac pain,  which is almost never sharp or stabbing in nature. It's also been stable for over a year now, and coronary artery disease tends to progress, not just remain the same over long  periods, unless there is a direct correlation between pain and exertion. While the guess at costochondritis was reasonable, and still may have been correct, the failure of the pain to respond to anti-inflammatories makes it seem less likely.   The palpitations would be due to (or at least increased by) caffeine in conjunction  with use of Vyvanase, which would create an additive effect. While it's surprising you weren't warned this could happen, you've demonstrated this is the case, so I think you can let go of palpitation concerns (which are almost never meaninful anyway, even when  very unpleasant feeling).   So we're left with the  question of the pain. I see no reason Vyvanase should be causing this, and the while  the bright red blood in stool probably deserves a mention to your doctor, if it was only once it's probably not urgent and very likely wasn't related to the pain either, since pain that high up, were it due to GI tract problems, would probably produce black, tarry stool if there was bleeding involved.  This leaves us with some random causes not related to your heart and probably not GI either. Still could be costochondritis, but if so this should be demonstrable by manual prodding,  pressing, etc., on the area. If this produces tenderness or pain, and/or if twisting of the upper body, or bending or reaching aggravates it, then this could very well be inflammatory and just require a stronger anti-inflammatory. It would probably do you good to have a consult with a cardiologist, if only to ease your mind about this. An EKG and echocardiogram is not unreasonable,  and if it's all negative then you'll need to look at other, probably musculskeletal causes.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Your procedure was done almost three weeks ago, but your question  was submitted just over a week after it was done. At that time it would be reasonable to have some mild swelling,  especially if you've been  climbing stairs, walking around, etc. If the swelling is siginicant (and by now it either has gotten better or gotten bad enough for you to seek attention) then you should be seen to make sure there's no bleeding inside the thigh muscle. If it's stabilized since you originally wrote, then  it should be fine. For the record, though, it's important that anyone having had an angiogram with or without stent placement stay off his  or her feet for a couple days, avoid stairs for about a week, and note and report any unusual swelling as soon as it's noticed. Hopefully by now yours has resolved.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  First we have to determine what you mean by \"fast.\" Have you actually taken your pulse and determined the rate? Anything between 60 and 100 can be considered normal. If you're drinking Red Bull on a regular basis this will certainly increase your heart rate over whatever may be normal for you. It's best to check your pulse while sitting, relaxed, and also best to count it for 15 seconds and multiply the number of beats in that period by 4 to get the correct total. It's going to be faster at certain times of the day, during certain activities, during stress, and when caffeine is ingested. Red Bull has lots of caffeine.   Sharp chest pains are almost always muscular in nature and not heart-related. Asthma can often cause these because of straining of accessory muscles while breathing.   Please let us know what you consider a \"fast\" heart rate and we can go from there. I hope  this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  The left (or right for that matter) auricular appendage is merely the conical profile of either atria (or aurical), the upper two heart chambers. The left one is most often more prominent and sometimes even slightly dilated, but the report overal is utterly negative (which is a very positive thing), meaning there is nothing abnormal to be  seen. Everything that's not precisely within \"spec\" must be noted in an imaging exam like this, so the tech or reading doctor goes to great lengths to describe what's seen, essentially to provide a baseline for what is \"normal\" for a given patient in the area being studied. Since not all auricular appendages are prominent or equally so, it's worth noting simply in order to compare it  with any future echocardiograms. In short, everything sounds fine.  Hope this is helpful to you. Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  Grandma --   That  just feels really odd to say to someone so young! I don't think your stent placement is responsible for the unilateral leg swelling, but since you have a history of vascular problems (heart), this could be indirectly related in the respect that you may have widespread, scattered vascular inflammation or a clotting disorder. Swelling and pain in one leg is of more urgent concern than if both were that way, oddly enough, because it often is due to one or more clots being lodged in a deep vein. Is the swelling in the calf? This would be typical enough of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) to warrant an urgent look with ultrasound at least. You wouldn't need to see the cardiologist for this, but a GP or even a visit to an acute care walk-in or (hate to suggest it, but if there's no other alternative) to the ER would be wise in order to rule out DVT, which can cause some serious problems if left alone.  Hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with  us here and also keep us updated. Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, 48 year old male, overweight 320lbs 6'2.  Moderately active. BP on AZOR typically 120/75. Cholesteral levels good.  Year ago started to be awakened at night with a slight chest discomfort followed by a flushed feeling washing over body, mostly from chest to legs. Happened maybe once a week but became more frequent over time.  Doc suspected sleep apnea, sounded reasonable but then the feelings started to happen while awake. Episode seems to start as a overall funny feeling, like something not right.  This is usually folowed by a sharp pain approx 1 inch left of sternum but doesn't feel deep, maybe just below ribs.  After the pain a flushed feeling occurs washing over body and then I seem fine for a while.  One day it occurred constantly and wound up in ER.  First enzyme test 0, second .1, third 0. Nothing notable on EKG and even though I had the feeling while hooked up it did not register on EKG.  Cardiologist suggested that since my brother who is diabetic had a major heart attack a couple weeks earlier, along with my weight and age, a heart cath would be wise.  He and I were shocked, no plaque or blockage at all, everything perfect.  Went to regular Doc with the results. She suggested stress and also set up sleep apnea test.  Sleep study show 40+ episodes of stopped breathing in three hours, longest was 55 seconds, 02 sats were in low 60's.  Got the machine two weeks ago, using every night, sleeping better but the feelings continue, both at night and while awake. It almost feels as though something is blocked, breaks loose and then I feel OK.   I had pericarditas at age 15 and the sharp pain feels similar. Was on stress medication, Bup???, but had no effect.  The episodes occur usually once a day, sometimes more.  I am getting more concerned as well as confused.  If there are no blockages then not likely heart but it certainly feels like it is.  I had high hopes for the CPAP but so far no relief.  I even thought possible carbon monoxide poisoning but checked house and vehicles and all were ok.  What else could be the source? Any thoughts?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Needle like pain followed by flush feeling",
    "content": "Hello -  The sensation you're  describing is a learned (by the body) startle reflex triggered by the sharp, stabbing pain, which is almost never cardiac in nature (although it can, as you've noted, occur with pericarditis). Your pain seems to be fleeing, however, and while  it's remotely possible you could have pericarditis again, it is probably something simpler like costochondritis, an inflammation of the cartilage between the ribs where they join the sternum. This often responds well to the same medications as pericarditis (Advil, Aleve, etc.). However, many times people with sleep disorders develop an exaggerated startle reflex, which is certainly consistent with your sleep study findings.   The medication you were on before was probably Buspar (generica name busparone). It is often good for mild chronic anxiety, but is on the weaker end of the spectrum.   If you're using the CPAP mask now, over a  period of time your body may \"unlearn\" this startle reflex, but some people have it even without sleep apnea, and sometimes a medication like Buspar is helpful with this sort of thing. If not,  there are other, more effective, antianxiety drugs available. Hopefully the unlearning of the reflex will come with correction of the nighttime breathing interruptions.   Hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you with this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  This is a fairly loaded question you pose. While the sensation you describe could be a lot of things, most of them innocent, you do have some history that could have a bearing on this (and I'm not talking about the heroin use). On the other hand, usually if one can aggravate a symptom like this via change of position, it's usually not cardiac-related. However, once again, this is a little bit less usual a set of circumstances than usual, so I'm going to suggest that you get yourself seen, but of course you'll have to decide how far you can afford to allow any further testing to go. You might try discussing the financial situation with the doctor up front or find a clinic that works on a sliding scale. There are a lot of people in financial straits right now, a lot of people out of work and a whole lot of people without health insurance. We can't just tell them to ignore troubling symptoms. You won't get an on-line diagnosis here, first because we never do that anyway,  and second because there isn't enough information, let alone face-to-face,  hands-on exam potential. This is what's needed. I could make some guesses, but that's not how we do business. It's your health we'd be gambling with. I hope you understand no responsible medical person will pretend to diagnose you on the basis of a post or two on line.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck with this, and I do hope you'll find a way to be seen for at least a superficial exam.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If I am not in the right forum please direct me to where I can find some answers.  In March 2008 I had quadruple bypass surgery. Several months after the surgery after normal surgical pain subsided I continuously have a burning pain in my chest, shoulder blades and back. I've been to a cardiologist, neurologist, thoracic surgeon, infectous disease doctor, and internal medicine. No one has any answers for me. Below is a detailed explanation of the pain:  Laying on my back, sitting in chair, riding in automobile gives a burning sensation in the whole chest cavity. The pain is internal, from back through the chest. It feels like a severe internal sunburn. On both sides of my chest I cannot tolerate light touches to the sternum. Pressure on the area does not bother me. However, my shirt, a seatbelt, or any subtle rubbing (pressure) on the area the \"sunburn\" type pain starts externally on the skin but then travels through the chest cavity all the way to my back. When lifting any objects or turning a certain way, twisting, etc , if any pressure is on my chest muscles I get pain after the movement. Please keep in mind that I do not feel the pain when I am lifting objects. The pain comes several hours later and sometimes even the next day. It is a debilitating pain that hinders my ability to be comfortable in any position. Even laying down or resting, the pain persists.  Also note that the thoracic surgeon removed the sternal wires in the hopes that it would help. The pain is still ongoing.   I am on the following meds: Tricor, altace, percoset for pain, citalopram.  I ask that you please send any guidance. Whether it is recommending me to another type of specialist, or a possible diagnosis I will greatly appreciate it. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Burning Pains in chest and shoulders after quad bypass surge",
    "content": "Hello -  It seems you're having one of those rare, really weird sensory side effects from thoracic surgery, probably involving intercostal nerve injury. This is one of the few benign but really annoying potential complications and it does match up well with your description. It also can be sensitive to position -- usually any position that places  pressure or stress on the ribs. This is most common  in patients who've had at least one mammary artery \"pulled over\" to accomplish one or two of the bypasses. These are preferred when possible. If that was done in your case, this is a good bet, and can be treated with drugs capable of blocking nerve pain.   There is also a remote possibility (remote because you've had a very thorough followup by cardiologist and surgeon) that this could be due to pericarditis, which is often seen post CABG, usually sooner, however. If there's no effusion (collection of fluid inside the pericardial sac) it may not show up readily on imaging and can cause positional pain, usually described as either sharp and stabbing or burning. Again, this seems somewhat less likely than irritation of the intercostal nerves.  I'm really sorry you had to have this problem. You may need to have a consult with a  pain management specialist and/or neurologist, since this does sound a lot like nerve pain (thanks  for your very well put history and description of symptoms).  I hope this is helpful. If you think of anything more, please let us know, and of course follow up with us as needed anyway. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I'm male 28 years old. I didn't work out since few years. I started exercising since two week. I ran for 4 day each week, 30 minutes per day for the first week and 40 minutes per day  for the second week plus doing stretching. In the forth day of the second week, I've increased by speed run, later in the night I've woke up and my heart rate was very fast. few days later, I have a pain on the left side of my chest and sometime i feel my hear beat very fast. so I've checked my doctor, and he said that's it's true my heard rate is fast, it's about 90 beat per minutes, but he also said, that there is nothing about that because my heart beat regularly.  My heart rate before starting exercising was about 72 per minutes and now it's about 60 beat per minutes.  I've also like to mention that I'm stressed and perhaps depressed a little since few years.  What I'm wonder about is why these symptom started on night that I've increased my run speed. Also what possible causes that could lead to let appear these symtoms.  Thanks in Advance\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chest pain and fast heart beat rate",
    "content": "Hello -  An increased resting heart rate often remains after a new and markedly demanding exercise regimen is first begun. Sometimes it  is due to some residual dehydration (you must be certain to keep yourself hydrated, by drinking plenty of water before, during and after these workouts); it also can sometimes be an autonomic reflex triggered by the stress of the new exercise.   It appears that now your resting rate has slowed some, which is also typical of an effective aerobic exercise program, and is a good sign that you are making good  progress.  Stress can always cause an unpleasant awareness of one's heartbeat, and can also cause an increase in heart rate. Exercise often has a good effect on stress and helps to reduce it, but concern over the health of one's heart can also be stressful.    It sounds as though you're doing well with the exercise, and your heart should start to adjust to the extra work soon. As long as it isn't running much above 100 at rest it's probably fine, as long (as your doctor said) it remains regular.   I hope this is helpful to you.  Best of luck to you. Keep up the good work with the exercise program.\n\n",

    "title": "T-wave inverson",
    "content": "I am a surgical nurse and I need to find answers to my electrocardiogram showing a T-wave inversion. I am now 34 yrs old, HTN runs in my family at an early age, I am 50lbs overweight, and I have stress(just finished a divorce, little sleep, stressful work environment). I was diagnosed with high blood pressure  01/06(ER visit w/ BP 180/110) and had an EKG showing T-wave inversion. I was not told about this EKG finding. I went to a PCP who did an EKG and it was normal sinus rhythm - no T-wave inverson (in 03/06). I was put on propanolol 80mg/day.  My next EKG was 12/06 at the hospital, when I passed out at work from very high blood pressure (170/110). An EKG was done, and showed a T-wave inversion, the same as my previous hospital EKG, so nothing was said. My PCP then prescribed me to divide my meds to take twice a day, and so far, it appears to have solve my HTN issues.   Two weeks ago, while driving home from Houston, under no physical stress, I developed certain, noticible chest pain. The pain was midline, under the sternum, and was about a 7 out of 10 on the pain scale. I have never had pain like this and was constant for the next 24hours . It slowly disappated over the next 4 days. It did not change or move and it was very uncomfortable, hard to decribe, except that it hurt pretty bad. I went to my doctor the next afternoon and the EKG showed a T-wave inversion, a different result from the previous EKG in the office showing NSR in 03/06.   He wanted me to have a Thalium stress test done. I went ahead and consulted a local cardiologist and I am now scheduled for a nuclear stress test.  My question is: What medical issues could be the cause of the T-wave inversion, given my medical history and what are the possible outcomes of my situation(how serious is it).  Thank you for your comments.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: T-wave inverson",
    "content": "Hello -  Inverted T-waves are often a cause of much consternation, and at least half the time they don't signify anything serious. However, you have enough risk factors to warrant the stress test, and that's a great idea. I'm happy you'll be doing that and look  forward to hearing how it turns out.  It is possible you have some early coronary artery disease. With the symptoms you experienced the one time, plus the markedly elevated BP, overweight, and an EKG abnormality, it is possible the T-wave inversion signified some intermittent ischemia, and if this is the case you're going to want to know about it so as to take the necessary steps to avoid damage and mitigate any disease.   You also may not have any disease. The chest pain was in the appropriate location to be at least suspect, but the fact that it was so severe and localized makes me wonder if it wasn't due to something else. There is, of course, no way of knowing for certain,  but most substernal pain due to cardiac causes is usually described as dull, as pressure, and not generally severe in nature. Once notable exception to this rule is when the pain is due to coronary artery spasm, but that doesn't usually last more than 15-20 minutes. And before I go any further, I would urge you, should this happen  again, to no allow it to go on for 24 hours, or even 24 minutes, but maybe 5 at the most, before you get yourself to an ER. For one thing, it would be easier to rule out heart-related issues. Of course the flip side of that is that it could also be life-saving. Please don't play the odds on this sort of thing. You do, after all, have a couple risk factors, and women actually do sometimes develop heart disease young.   Did the T-wave inversion occur in all leads or just a few? Can you relate which ones? Also,  do you know if the inversion was deep or just flipped? These things are significant. Often stress itself, dehydration, low potassium and a few other factors can cause flipped T-waves. So can ischemia,  but in the absence of risk factors and symptoms, it is a less likely cause.  While we can discuss what might be going on, the only sure way to find out is for you to have that stress test. Please follow up with us here afterward, if you don't mind. Hopefully it comes out negative, but if there is something more going on, you'll need to know that too. I'll  look forward to hearing more. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I've done a ECG past month, but I most likely won't be able to have a cardiologist to take a look at it and really explain it to me until some day in the next month, or maybe somewhat later (public health system constraints).  The ECG was indeed analyzed by a doctor, whose specializations are \"intensive medicine\" and \"internal medicine\", but I've never met him face to face, I've only received the ECG with his signature on.  His interpretation of the data differed somewhat from the computer's \"interpretation\". The values that came printed with the ECG are: vent. rate 69 bpm PR int. 134 ms QRS dur. 108 ms QT/QTc int. 392/ 412 ms P/QRS/T axis 34/69/18\u00b0 RV5/SC1 amp. 1.595/ 0.735 mV RV5+SV1 amp. 2.330 mV   The doctor's numbers, on a pre-printed paper with underlines: MCF: 60 bpm Pri: 0,13 seg QRS 0,11 seg  Conclusion: 1 - right bundle branch block; 2 - Alteration of the ventricular repolarization on the anterior wall  And a scan of the ECG itself is here:   http://img377.imageshack.us/my.php?image=outmi5.jpg   I'm a bit suspicious of the V1 lead. Whereas I and V6 look reasonably like the samples on [url=http://medinfo.ufl.edu/~ekg/QRS%20&%20BBB.html]this web page[url], I think that the V1 looks somewhat more like the LBBB one. :(  And also there's this discrepancy on the QRS duration between the doctor and the machine. If the machine is right, QRS is ok and there's no BBB of any sort, right? Searching a bit about it on the net I've read vague statements such as \"don't rely on the machine's results\" (not directed to me, but on ECGs in general), but I wonder why, and where these extra milliseconds from the human read would have came from...   I'm somewhat scared with the whole thing, I've read that RBBB ranges from something that's harmless to something that commonly results in sudden death among young people with it. I've some eventual mild symptoms, what I think that is presyncope (the best example/description is that I'd be reading and would miss the line for about a second, as if someone had shaken the book of my hand; it's somewhat like falling asleep too, which is scary when I'm actually trying to sleep) and even sporadic, but quite light pain on my chest, and some days I feel somewhat as if I were wearing a tight sleeve on the left arm alone. I once (2006) went to the emergency for these symptoms , had an auscultation and ECG, and the doctor said that it was nothing to worry about.  Thanks so much for an answer. All the wait I have ahead is quite disturbing.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is this really an RBBB? Is this important?",
    "content": "Hello -  First of all, there is no bundle branch block pattern, right or left, in the sample EKG you included here. Second, RBBB is not serious, often occurring in otherwise healthy, normal hearts. It may, in rare instances, be  a precursor of a more serious type of block, but usually and of itself it has little to no significance. However, it's also not there, and if it were (or LBBB for that matter) it would show up in all leads, not just one or two.  On the other hand, your EKG is not textbook \"normal\", as it has some repolarization abnormalities as noted,  with non-specific T-wave changes in III, avr and V-6. This could be due to a number of relatively benign factors or could even be a \"normal abnormality\" for you. Many of us do have fixed abnormalities that are non-specific, but are like a signature and are good to know about in case anything changes in the future.   T-wave inversion (what shows up in the three \"abnormal\" leads) can be caused by anything from hyperventilation to potassium depletion to positioning of the leads. It can, of course, also signify some non-specific heart disease, but in the absence of symptoms this is extremely difficult to know. A stress test would resolve any lingering questions about this. Deeply inverted T-waves are suggestive of ischemia or possibly an acute myocardial infarction. Flipped T-waves like those in the three questionable leads in your EKG, frequently mean nothing.   I don't think your symptoms match up with anything that shows up in your EKG. You may have hypervetilated during or prior to the test, or your electrolytes may have been off. The leads may have been improperly placed, or, and this is a stretch, you may have some old injury or ischemia, but it doesn't look like it. As  you mentioned regarding \"vague statements\", a resting EKG won't always reveal occult heart disease -- only a stress test, with or without nuclear scan, and possibly a consequent angiogram, can determine this with any certainty. However, in the absence of classic symptoms, most doctors would consider this EKG mostly fine but with \"nonspecific T-wave abnormalities\" in III,  avr and V-6. Not really much  of a finding, but if it causes you a great deal of concern then you most certainly ought to follow up with  the doctor about it. Again, although it would not be important anyway, there is no RBBB nor LBBB present in  the  EKG nor do the abnormalities resemble either of those patterns, so I'm perplexed by the doctor's notation in that regard.  Overall it is an unremarkable EKG, given the lack of symptoms.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks very much for answering.  It's very relieving to read this sort of thing, despite of feeling somewhat odd about the diverging interpretations about RBBB. For what I've been reading, I'd guess it were an \"incomplete\" one, but I don't really know much about it, I've just noted that the EKG does not fill all the requirements, starting with the length of the QRS, which strangely differs in the machine's diagnosis and the doctor's notes.  But my main worry was actually these inversions on the T waves, specially the one that does not match with the expected inversions if it were an RBBB, since I've read that the \"good\" inversions are typically asymmetrical, unlike these ones. But as you've explained, there's more to it.  I've finally scheduled a visit \"in real life\" with a cardiologist, and hopefully everything will be further clarified. According to what I've been reading, it could be a nasty-looking cluster of annoying things that are in fact harmless, \"precordial catch syndrome\", \"da Costa's syndrome\" and things like that. Some of them occur at clusters during one's lifetime, which is also good to know. Well, that's for the doctor to tell in the \"real life\" visit, but is a seemingly realistic perspective that helps me to sleep.   Thanks again.\n\n",

It's more difficult to recognize, and I don't see it, but it is somewhat open to interpretation and I've seen (and been in ) a few lively debates over things like this.   The T-wave inversions are odd, especially since they're not deep,  so not especially scary looking. There are a lot of potential causes for this to happen, and you've listed some of them.

While  not everyone has equally palpable pedal  pulses on both sides, usually at least one side is easily palpated. Your sister is correct in that this could represent a serious problem,  either involving a nerve in the  involved leg or, more likely, a disturbance of the blood supply to the  affected leg, somewhere along  the course of the left femoral artery. It  definitely deserves further study, at least.  Hopefully this is helpful to you.\n\n",

In February 2008, she went in for triple bypass surgery.  She spent about 30 days in the hospital recovering and then returned for another 15 days and finally was fitted for a pace maker.  Her Cardilogist said her heart is significantly weaker than prior to the surgery.  He recently informed her that her heart is operating at approximately 15-20% after performing some tests and there is nothing she can do to strengthen it.  My Mom is now 64 year olds and I do not believe there is nothing she can do to strengthen her heart.  This diagnosis of \"nothing you can do\" has negatively impacted her confidence in any hope of getting back to a semi-normal lifestyle.  Do you have any advice?

    "title": "Re: 15-20% Heart Strength after quadruple bypass surgery",
    "content": "Hello -  I think the first thing we need is some clarification of terms. You (or your mother) need to determine if the doctor actually means the heart is functioning at 15-20% of its former capacity, then that  needs to be qualified somehow. If, on the other  hand, he meant  the left ventricular ejection fraction is at 15-20 (not a per cent figure) this would  be more concrete and would  tell me the heart is severely compromised.   Even if this is the case, there do exist some therapies to strengthen a failing heart muscle. There are medications that are often used, there are even devices which can sometimes either  improve the cardiac output or at least give the weakened heart a break so it can hopefully regain some of its strength. I can well understand your mother feeling demoralized by this bleak outlook, and I wonder if there isn't a second opinion (perhaps at a more sophisticated medical center) that could help. Your mother is really pretty young to be in such dire circumstances, and I would very much  like  to know what took place during (or rior to) the second bypass surgery that might have caused such a dramatic drop in output.   If there are any additional facts you can think of, that might be helpful. I can't imagine a heart considered a candidate for bypass surgery that afterward would work so much worse than before the surgery without there being some other factor involved. I also feel that making a flat, factual statement that there is \"nothing you can do\" is a dangerous and utterly unhelpful act. The mental outlook of the patient is a huge part of the potential recovery process and telling a patient something like this does nothing to help, that much is for sure.  Please follow up with us as needed. Best of luck to you and your mother.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  I can think of no reason to not take the prescribed medication and every reason to take it. Your score puts you at a slightly increased risk of a coronary event, and demonstrates that you have some early heart disease. The Pravachol could slow or arrest the development of plaque, and may well even, over time, help in its reduction. It is well worth the inconvenience of remembering to take one pill daily. Think of it as a sort of vitamin. It will be beneficial and rarely does any harm (there is, of course, the requirement to check liver enzymes after a few months or if you should develop persistent muscle aches, especially in the legs, but this is rare and usually not a problem).   Hope this is helpful.\n\n",

It was 97/59 (for me normal is 115/75). My pulse was 115 (normal is about 80 - 85).  Since then, I have been monitoring my pressure daily. The only symptom I have is fatigue, but I do still have the occasional dizziness. I have found that my pressure barely crosses 100/60. Many times it is lower, and my pulse is consistently over 90, mostly over 100. I have gone to my GP who doesn't think it is a problem. This is not normal for me and it is not resolving itself.

    "title": "Re: Low blood pressure, high pulse rate",
    "content": "Hello -   The attack of dizziness needs some explication if you don't mind, since the blood pressure variations you report would not be enough to cause faintness (which wouldn't perisist for a day or more anyway, without either going away or you passing out). It sounds much more like benign positional vertigo caused the dizziness, and this is often accompanied by a feeling of confusion, since one's surroundings seem to be moving. If you could describe the episode in a little more detail it would be helpful.  Again, and especially given your petite stature, the slight decrease in blood pressure should not have caused prolonged dizziness, nor the marked increase in heart rate. Since you already knew your normal rate and pressure I have to assume you check it fairly often, which could suggest you are by nature an anxious person. If this is so, a sudden bout of dizziness could make you feel anxious and cause a modest increase in heart rate.   Your current heart rate and blood pressure readings are fairly consistent with a person of your height, whereas the dizzy spell, having lasted more of a day, almost certainly was vertigo, probably of the benign positional sort.   If the fatigue persists and/or the dizziness recurs, I would certainly inform my doctor if I were you, but I can tell you your vital signs are within normal limits at this time, even though they may not be  what you consider normal for you. They don't account for the dizziness, and if related to the fatigue at all, are probably secondary to the cause of that.   I hope this is helfpful. Please stay in touch.\n\n",

The PF testing may help to be sure that your lungs are OK since they can impact the heart as well.  Seeing a neurologist about your MS is important to be sure you are on the right treatment plan for you.  If you continue to have the persistently elevated heart rate, seeing a cardiologist is reasonable.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: increased heart rate",
    "content": "Hi Brittany628 -   While there is nothing intrinsically wrong with a heart rate in the 90s, it does represent a change for you, and it may be worth looking at what could have caused the change, especially since you are athletic and so more likely to have a slower heart rate than normal at rest.   Simple things first: Any new or increased caffeine intake? Stress? Sleep disturbance? Anxiety? All other things being equal, these are the usual suspects.  Also, are there any other symptoms associated with this increased (and presumably resting) rate? Any heartbeat irregularities or palpitations you're aware of?  Do you otherwise feel perfectly fine and normal?  All other things being equal, and assuming no other problems exist, you might just casually mention this observation at your next regular doctor appointment. There is always the remote possibility it could signal the onset of a thyroid problem, but generally \"normal\" range of heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. It tends to be faster in many people who are petite, and slower in those who are athletic, but there is a lot of room for variety. At the same time, a marked change is worth at least a quick look.   Please let us know if any of the above questions could be answered \"yes.\" Otherwise we'll just assume this is within nornal limits (WNL).  Best of luck (and health) to you.\n\n",

The results were good, with only a very slight, initial sign of \"possible diastolic dysfunction\". According to the 220-age formula, my max heart rate should be 188, but during an all out 5k recently, I pushed it hard competing and was over my max(around 195 on my heart monitor) for a good 8-9  minutes.  Using the \"perceived exertion\" method, I felt I was at a 9-10 on a 1-10 scale.   My question for you is: Is this safe to do if I am in good health, or am I damaging my heart?

    "content": "Hi,  There are two types of exercise. Aerobic and Anaerobic. The former depends on the consumption of high amounts of oxygen and is the exercise which involves prolonged sustaind mid level activity like running, walking, swimming, cycling.   Anaerobic exercise is typically short but intense bouts of activity like weight lifting. This is also called Isometric exercise. This exercise causes different kind of muscle development, which is massive and long lasting.   When one exercises upto heart rate of 85% of 220-age, it is Aerobic. After this the metabolism turns to lactate and the exercise becomes anaerobic. There is usually nothing wrong with doing anrearobics, provided you do not have a heart disease.   The instance you have been talking about is called 'Fartlek'. This involes a prolonged sustained bout of exercise at aerobic level interspersed with short bout of intense exercise at anerobic level.   Apurva\n\n",

There they ran all kinds of tests on me, the results of all of them were normal. I have mentioned the details of these reports below. Then they sent me back saying that it was probably just the acidity or anxiety..(Let me also tell you that till this day I was a heavy smoker..almost a pack a day and was drinking alcohol occasionally..now its been more than 7-8 months since I quit smoking completely and don\u2019t drink more that a drink or two once or twice in a month)  But after this episode I have always been getting these weird chest pains..sometimes in the left below my nipple or below the last rib or sometimes in the right near nipple or near/below the ribs..and sometimes its in the center..and sometimes just below the ribs\u2026these pains keep coming back everyday..4-5 times a day or sometimes just once in 2-3 days..though these pains don\u2019t last for more than a minute most of the times.. I have been to all kinds of doctors and everyone sent me back saying that I was just fine..

    "title": "Abnormal EKG After Car Accident",
    "content": "In 2003 I had three normal EKG and ECHO test results after experiencing a few-day incidence of high blood pressure/bradycardia ten days after giving birth.  Almost five years later, two days ago, I was a passenger (husband was driving) in a car that slid into a ditch (slowly, thankfully) while travelling home just at the beginning of a snow storm. I have a small bruise on my left chest where I \"hit\" the seat belt. Because of the bruise the responding police officer insisted I be transferred to the ER, where they did a \"precautionary\" EKG. My results were abnormal, but the attending physician said the results were \"not indicative of anything.\" He did another EKG; compared the results to my 2003 EKGs which were  done at the same hospital; and consulted the on-call cardiologist, who told him I could go home and should follow up with my regular doctor. The attending physician said he did not believe the EKG results were related to the accident, and I probably need an ECHO to see \"what changed.\"  I have an appointment with my doctor for next week. In the meantime, I am wondering if everything going on at the time would be sufficient to cause an abnormal EKG.  For one thing, I felt stressed that I was taken to the ER and kept there late into the night while I had older children at home alone, I was concerned about money (deductible, what this will do to our insurance, will insurance pay the hospital, etc.), we had another person with us who hurt her back and was also being evaluated at the hospital, etc.  Thanks to the busyness of the holiday week, I had had little sleep the night before and only a late, light breakfast and two cups of coffee before a big dinner at 8:00PM. Before the dinner and four hours before the EKG I had one cocktail (husband had a soda), and I don't usually drink because I have a low tolerance.  Could my atypical schedule, eating habits, and stress be enough to cause an abnormal EKG?  I am 5'4\", 155 and have a normal-to-low regular blood pressure.  I've never had chess pain (except now from the bruise from my seat belt), but I have been rather sedentary the past three months due to work. (I went to the gym four times a week until September and have since gained ten pounds.) Of course, since the ER visit I'm feeling a little anxious about the abnormal EKG as well as shaken from the accident, but I'm trying just to enjoy the holidays with my family.  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Abusymom,  It is unlikely that the stress you are describing would cause EKG changes.  The heart is basically shielded from these types of things.  Stress can certainly affect the heart but it tends to be a long term issue.  Basically, stress tends to increase the blood pressure.  Elevated blood pressure makes the heart work harder, which can \"wear it out\" over time.  It is possible that if the bruise was over the area where the EKG electrodes go, the associated swelling could potentially cause problems with the EKG.  My best advise for you is to have the EKG repeated in a few weeks once the bruising has resolved.  If it continues to be abnormal, seeing a cardiologist would be appropriate.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My pulmonoligst ruled out sleep apnea and said it was something that needed to be followed.  From what I have read some say this reading is not significant at all while others claim it may get worse.  The only advice my cardiologist wanted me to follow was to repeat an echo once a year.  Well that time has come but my Primary care docotor said that it does not seem important to get it done (I am HMO and need his referral).  Is this something I should push for?  Also are these readings something I need to followup on and get a second opinion?  Are there specific causes that could create this problem and is it likely to get worse or better over time?  Thanks.\n\n",

It may have been an incidental thing that has since resolved but it is safest to be sure.    I would recommend you readdress this issue with your doctor and see what his reasoning for not needing the follow up is.  There may be a very good reason.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Usually, if a medicine needs to be stopped they would have told you at the time that the test was scheduled.  However, if there is a contact number for your doctor to contact him ahead of time just to be sure this would be best since there are a few medicines that should be stopped ahead of time.

I'm overweight, with a family history of heart disease (grandmother and grandfather both died of heart related problems).  I recently started allowing myself a few soda's a day, and noticed that was about when the chest pains started, but I'm still worried.  Oh and the pain is dull, not sharp, if that helps any.  Oh and almost forgot, I have issues with depression and anxiety, and when I have anxiety attacks I have chest pains as well, but this feels different then it normally does when I have anxiety attacks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi TiredMomof2Angels,  Typical heart chest pain is often described as being more of a severe pressure than a sharp pain.  It is often difficult to pinpoint exactly where the pain is coming from.  Rather, it is a more vague chest pain.  Sometimes, there will be associated arm, neck, or back pain as well.  If this describes your pain you should definitely have it evaluated.  Caffeine in soda can increase reflux so it is possible that you are experiencing is due to acid reflux.  If this is the case it would be expected that reflux medicines and antacids should help some.  If your pain continues or worsens I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My dad had a heart attack last December and my maternal grandma had heart attacks as well.  I had gall bladder surgery and ablation surgery, approx 10 years ago  My EKG, blood work were fine, my blood pressure is great 108 over 80, cholesterol is also low.  My chest x-ray was abnormal and showed swelling near my sternam area, my doc seems to think that it is paricarditis and prescribed prednisone, it has helped the pain somewhat but if i am veyr active at all it hurts more and i am still having one or two \"espisodes\" per hour.  My doc doesnt want me to come back for 5 days, should I seek a second opinion, or should i go to the ER and have more tests done?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jellybean1972,  Pericarditis can certainly cause the pain you are describing.  Typically, pericarditis will cause ECG changes.  It would be unusual to see any changes on an X-ray associated with pericarditis.  If the \"swelling\" was around the heart there may be some fluid in the pericardial sack (the covering of the heart).  This condition is called a pericardial effusion.    Prednisone is a steroid that will treat inflammation so it would help a pericarditis if it is present.  Your symptoms may also be due to reflux.  If your pain continues to improve you can likely wait until your follow up.  If it gets worse I would suggest seeing your doctor sooner.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While a look at his EKG would be extremely helpful, it may well not be adequate by itself to explain what the problem may be. Because of his young  age, if there is any actual heart problem it is probably structural and present from birth. The types of congenital structural heart disorders are numerous and range from the fairly benign to the  rather dangerous. The exercise intolerance and chest pain suggest he may suffer from hypertrophy of the heart muscle, which must be followed by a cardiologist and can often be managed medically. However, the symptoms could also be due to something less serious, such as prolapse of  the mitral valve.   If you are able to find a way to upload an image of his EKG, that might  be  of some help in determining what may be wrong, but he certainly should be examined by a cardiologist. Hopefully the problem is not very serious.  Please let us know if you can find any more information. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Pain induced by changing conditions is less likely to be cardiac related.  It may be that you have costochondritis.  This is a condition where the cartilage of the ribs becomes inflamed.  If you push on the area that hurts with movement and it causes the same pain, costochondritis is likely.  Given your family history it is important that you have regular check-ups and stay in contact with your doctor.  If you have not had an evaluation in a while I would recommend you do so to be sure that this pain is not related to the heart.  It most likely isn't but if I'm wrong the consequences could be severe.  (Keep in mind that I am not examining you and only giving some general advise based on the info I have.)  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My father (71) just went to see his cardiologist after having extreme fatigue. He's doctor did an EKG, which he said was normal; however, he estimated his pulmonary artery pressure to be 68 mmHg. All the literature I can find on the internet says that the normal range is around 20...with 70 mmHg, an average starting pressure for heart attacks/failure. His doctor has ordered a sleep test for a month from now, suspecting that sleep apnea is the cause of what he thinks is pulmonary hypertension. Can he wait this long if his pressure is so high? And, how accurate is an EKG at estimating pulmonary artery pressure? And, finally, can you really diagose someone with pulmonary hypertension with simply an EKG?  Any help would be greatly apprecited!(really worried).  Thanks, concerned daugther\n\n",

    "content": "Dear qwert, I respect you for doing your research into your father's clinical condition.  An EKG is an electrocardiogram - which is by definition the tracing of electrical activity across the heart.  There has been established over decades what would constitute a normal tracing - with certain allowable variables in the parameters for \"normal\".  With that in mind, one could see, to some degree, certain anatomical abnormalities such as hypertrophy or cardiomegaly.  Based on ones knowledge of the clinical concurrencies of these abnormalities, one could certainly suppose certain probabilities such as pulmonary hypertension related to Right sided heart failure, especially if your father also has COPD or other pulmonary complications.  To use an EKG alone for determining the degree of hypertension seems unlikely.  Did the cardiologist also do an echocardiogram?  This could account for his diagnosis, since it would show some of the clinical contributing factors for pulmonary hypertension.    Is your father short of breath, as well as fatigued?  Have they done other tests to rule our pulmonary emboli? (Such as  VQ scan or Chest Cat Scan done specifically to rule in/rule out PE). PE can be very serious, but has readily available treatment options.  The only way I am aware of to get a definite diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and to ascribe a value of the pressures associated therewith, is to do a heart catheterization or other internal heart pressure monitoring (such as a SWAN that may be placed post surgery to closely monitor cardiac pressures in an intensive care unit.  I suggest you consider taking your father to the local emergency room if he is still symtomatic, and let the ER physician evaluate him for pulmonary emboli, as well as being able to run lab tests to see if his chemistry is within normal limits, or even his CBC (complete blood  count) to see if he is anemic.  There are so many reasons why one might be fatigued.  Since you are obviously concerned and think there is possibly something other than sleep apnea at work here, please explore other possibilities.\n\n",

What would be the best non-invasive test to do this?  Also, I tried getting into a cardiologist but they said I need a referal and none of my docs will give me one.  The places just say \"follow up with your primary care doctor\" which just sounds so absurd to hear when obviously that's what I've already been doing.  Anyway, I'm trying to find a doc who will pay attention.  Because I tell them I've had a workup, mainly urological and some blood work and cat scans, the docs automatically say they can't help me.  But, they can if they would try.  So, my new approach is going to be a more direct one, simply asking a doc to do specific tests.  So, I'm looking for one to evaluate blood flow from the pelvis and down in the body, preferrably non-invasive.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Poda,  In general, angiography refers to visualization of the blood vessels (whether arteries or veins) using a dye under a special x-ray machine. Virtually, it is a term used when arteries are visualized. There is what is known as a venous phase, where after injecting the dye into the arteries going to a certain organ, the veins that are draining the blood coming out of this organ will show the dye but weakly.  Venography refers to visualization of veins. The dye is injected into the veins directly with very good visualization to diagnose any diseases of the veins such as blood clots.

    "title": "Unknown chest pain in 22 y/o male",
    "content": "First I'll tell you a bit about myself so you might know why I am concerned [I apologize for the length of this post, I'll be as brief as possible]:  My recent history:  I am a 22 year old male with mild arthritis [an unspecific diagnosis], narcolepsy [confirmed by MSLT]. I have persistant asthma and sinus problems. I have had strep infections every year, multiple times a year for many years. Around 25-30 times total.  The last few infections have been a bit intense. I went to sleep one evening, with no symptoms, and awoke 6 hours later with most of my joints completely frozen and in a puddle of sweat. I was home alone, unable to walk, talk, having trouble breathing and hallucinating. I awoke again with red patchy skin, swollen nodes but was able to get to the phone so I called someone to take me to the ER.  I was treated for a massive strep infection. An injection of rocephin, 2 injections of penicillin, an injection of medrol, methylprednisolone dose pack, amoxicillin [later switched to clindamycin] as well as saline drip and pain killers.  For several months now, I have had recurring chest pain in the area of the heart. This pain is generally concentrated in the middle to left of the chest, around the pectoralis major. This usually presents itself as a brief, sharp pain. Occassionally, pain is felt at the same time in the left shoulder blade and near the armpit.  I don't appear to get short of breath at the time but left the chest muscles twitche and I feel a pounding in [what feels like] my chest. Sometimes I feel hot or get flushed and feel throbbing in my head [especially my left ear].  My family has a history of cardiovascular disease. My parents both have high blood pressure and vascular diseases. My grandmother had her first stroke when she was 37. My brother has blood pressure which is quite often over 200/150 (as high as 237/180), even on medications.  I *do not* have high blood pressure and have had a few EKGs, which were normal. The pain was never present during those exams.  I did suffer a pretty severe injury to the left clavicle, just around the joint. The bone was shattered and it took several months of healing and therapy to regain somewhat full use of this arm. This injury happened when I was 16 and the pain has only started within the past year or so.  About a year and a half ago, I was taken via ambulance and treated for hypokalemia. The cause was unknown (I have a good diet), but the effects of this were intense. I was seeing dots, disoriented, unable to think clearly and had pretty bad cramps. I was told I could suffer muscle damage. I was treated successfully and released.  My doctor does not see concern for this chest pain. Once, when the pain was pretty severe, I went to an ER and the triage nurse actually laughed when I told her I was having chest pain.  I waited for 9 hours and left because I had to work early and had final exams. The second time, I went to my PC and he was reluctant to even give me an EKG in his office. He believes this chest pain is musculo-skeletal in origin but besides an EKG, I have had no other tests performed.  Am I overly worried or is the genuine reason for concern? I find it unlikely that I would have heart problems at such a young age, and I know there can be multiple causes of chest pain unrelated to heart conditions. However, I am worried about the medications I take for narcolepsy (Provigil now, was on Ritalin) and my medical problems / family history.\n\n",

    "content": "Costochondritis has never been considered as a diagnosis. This is possibly due to the fact that I have a very odd list of variable symptoms that no one can seem to attribute to a single condition.  I have not had bacterial infections since in the ER.  Studies have shown that frequent strep infections over a period of months or years can have quite severe complications. However, most literature I find on this is related to pediatrics and the frequency of strep infections is categorically higher.[http://intramural.nimh.nih.gov/pdn/web.htm].  My principle concern with the aforementioned symptoms is the chest pain. I can live the others, regardless of whether strep or genetics is the causative factor.  The chest pain bothers me because it is, at times, instantaneously debilitating when it occurs. Sometimes accompanied by pulsating senesations in the area commonly associated with the common carotid. Having narcolepsy subjects me to treatment with stimulants of one classification or another, unless of course I want to fall asleep in the middle of driving, talking, walking. I would like to have the possibility of a heart condition ruled out, but I think the PCP considers this a non-issue.  The fact is, I have been on Ritalin, Strattera, Desoxyn, Dexedrine and actually, at one time Xyrem [sodium oxybate/GHB] was considered, though it is a controversial treatment method which I was not comfortable with trying. As of now I am taking Provigil, which seems to carry less physical stimulant characteristics.  I just want to know how a heart condition could be confirmed or ruled out. Maybe its angina. Maybe its muscles spams. Maybe its a vascular problem. Maybe its idiopathic. I just want to be sure.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello oldhen - Well it sounds like you've run into a bottleneck. At this point you have a diagnosis, from the vascular surgeon, but he seems to think the cardiologist should correct the problem, which is actually an odd response because the cardiologist isn't really a vascular surgeon. All of the specialists and your primary provider now need to huddle and come up with a plan of treatment for this. It can be treated medically and may not be treatable surgically, but at this point it sounds like you're getting the ping pong approach - bounced back and forth between specialists, both (or all) of which should have a hand in deciding what's the best way to manage the problem. The Lyrica may well do the trick in time, and it's always tricky treating a nerve impingement involving scar tissue, which may be adhering to the nerve. A CT scan won't usually show up much in the way of soft tissue, which a recent scar is (although with time it will probably accrue some calcium and become visible but that could take years) and CT won't show blood vessels and nerves at all, so that's not going to demonstrate the problem very well. You need yourself a good quarterback at this point, someone to coordinate the effort. That probably should be your primary physician.   Good luck to you and I hope the Lyrica helps block the pain while you're waiting for a more definite prognosis.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello itsmethere - One of the most common abnormalities found in the general population is mitral valve prolapse (MVP), which also occurs (or at least is diagnosed) much more frequently in women. While you haven't mentioned a specific diagnosis of MVP, many of the abnormalities you've mentioned, though, are often associated with Mitral Valve Prolapse Syndrome (also known as dysautonomia). While the physical abnormalities often cannot be connected directly to the symptoms, there seems to be an association of some sort. This opinion has been controversial at times, but Montclair Baptist Hospital's Heart Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, has a long-established clinic devoted to this especially annoying and anxiety-producing phenomenon. Most of the symptoms you describe could possibly be ascribed to MVPS associated in some obscure way with your congenital heart abnormalities.  As for the suspicion of stroke, while not impossible, it does seem unlikely that a stroke would manifest itself in such a way. However, the additional symptoms might fit with MVPS.   While emotions play a role in this (or any) illness, to a greater or lesser degree, there can be no doubt the symptoms you feel and describe are physical and quite real. The important question is \"What is causing them and what can be done to minimize them?\"   MVPS/dysautonomia, while not life threatening, can be \"lifestyle threatening\" (a phrase borrowed from one of the founders of the Birmingham center). It might be worth exploring this possibility, since six cardiologists have declared your heart to be functioning in a healthy way, but with some benigh abnormalities which are often found to be present in people with a syndrome which causes most of the symptoms you've described.  Good luck with this. I hope this has been of some help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi itsmethere - The short answer to your question is no. However, that begs another question, and that is: is your shortness of breath genuine and if so, is it causing you to go into  a state of acute hyperventilation? What you described originally matches the  description of episodic hypervenitlation more than it does classic shortness of breath, and  is often part of the overall galaxy of symptoms associated with MVP Syndrome, even when actual MVP is not proven.   Brain damage may be caused by prolonged anoxia (no oxygen to the brain) which occurs during cardiac arrest from any cause, and usually occurs after 4-6 minutes have passed. In these instances the patient is unconscious virtually the entire time. Hypoxia, if real, will not cause brain damage. The  additonal work we do to breathe is what compensates and allows us to function during periods of hypoxia.   Have you ever been told you have been hypoxic by a medical person who has actually applied a pulse oximetry device's clip on your finger? The borderline range for concern is between 90-93 per cent O2 saturation. Below 90 is hypoxic but still quite sufficient to sustain consciousness and bodily function. On the other hand,  hyperventilation can make one feel as though breathing is being done in an airless environment and often  involves more physical effort than is involved in true shortness of breath (except, of course, in cases of severe asthma, where  one is actually breathing against an obstruction). Some patients with emphysema walk  around with pulse oxygen  levels in the low 80's. They  walk slowly, but they do walk.  Hyperventilation is often an unwelcome  diagnosis or suggestion, because it sounds a lot like being told \"it's all in your head.\" That's not the case. We can often breathe in a faulty way either due to emotional causes or physical ones, and either way the result is the same: we blow off more carbon dioxide (CO2) than we are designed to. There has to be some CO2 left in our blood in order to let the brain know to tell the body to take the next breath. When we accidentally blow off too much (through sighing, overbreathing, etc.), the  signal is not received, but since breathing is a semi-voluntary action, we are then  aware that our impulse to breathe is missing,  which feels like an  inability to breathe, and so we commence to overcompensate,  resulting in a truly horrible cycle where we continue to blow off ever more CO2 until there is virtually none in our system, we feel as though we cannot possibly breathe, get lightheaded (but almost never actually faint), become weak, shaky, experience numbness in the face, scalp and  hands, and may even develop spasm in the hands and/or feet. The more we fight for air  the more we feel  as though we are not getting any air at all! Eventually we are unable to sustain the energy level to do this,  and it corrects itself - until the next episode.    A sense of impaired cognition  is often  another very real phenomenon known as depersonalizatoin, which may take place before and/or during hyperventilation.  This  does not mean  you might not have some degree of shortness of breath (or even hypoxia) to start with, but it makes it a moot point, and of course it is impossible to know, long  distance like this, if my hypothesis is correct, but I strongly suspect it is. Some people deal  with this problem for many years because no one takes the time to demonstrate to them how it can be controlled and even eliminated. Some  healthcare providers believe it is unwise to discuss even normal clinical findings with an anxious patient, and sometimes this  is  a wise course, but more often,  in my experiene, a little extra time   spent explaining,  reassuring and even demonstrating (this is fairly easy if you are having bouts of hyperventilation) the cause and  effect process involved.   I sincerely hope you find a practitioner who will take the time to determine what is  causing the shortness of breath, let you know exactly what your oxygen saturation  level is and why, and  if it is normal proceed to demonstrate to you how hyperventilation can  be triggered, stopped and ultimately avoided. If there is true underlying shortness of breath this simple cardiorespiratory check would expose it and it could be traced to its cause, which doesn't seem likely to be due to any of the anatomical abnormalities which  have been found so far.  The best of luck to you and please do keep us apprised of anything new you may find out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi itsmethere - Barring any possibility of hyperventilation this really doesn't fit any textbook scenario very neatly. There are, of course, other possibilities. The best chance you have to uncover what is going on is to somehow manage to be in a clinical setting when these symptoms take place. The racing heart could, of course, be paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, which is essentially benign (except that it can be momentarily disabling for some people) but the severe shortness of breath, being intermittent and also paroxysmal, is much more difficult to pin down from afar. How long do these episodes usually last? Is there ever a chance you could get a paramedical unit to where you are or get yourself into an ER while they were still going on? A cardiac monitor and hemodynamic monitoring during an episode would be very telling, as would getting an accurate oxygen saturation level. It's conceivable you're having some sort of atypical asthma (and not all asthmatics produce audible wheezing without benefit of a stethescope - it's not always obvious). Other than these ideas I'm pretty much stumped at this point and would urge you to try and capture one of these events in a clinical setting, even if it means dialing 9-1-1 to catch the event in action. If this has already been done and there is no detectable abnormality then I'm totally stumped.  You do have some physical abnormalities which have been documented, but they are not capable of causing this sort of intermittent problem (except for episodes of rapid heart rate, which can sometimes be caused, indirectly, by an atrial septal aneurism). With any of these symptoms a feeling of faintness and leg weakness would be unsurprising, regardless of the root cause.  Good luck to you with this very frustration situation.\n\n",

    "content": "Well then you've done everything you can do in the short term, and they are still telling you everything's fine, which it may be - from their perspective. Something, however, is obviously causing a perceived and possibly intermittent shortness of breath - and it's not affecting your uptake of room air oxygen. That doesn't make it any more pleasant. It's possible the PFO (or intravascular shunt) changes its dynamic in some way from time to time (I only say this as speculation because some parts of the heart appear to be able to almost shape-shift at times). Grasping at straws here, because the problem is so weird relative to the clinical findings. And yes, everyone will, at some point, try on the anxiety answer to see if it fits. It's not unreasonable, but if you've totally ruled it out then there has to be some really unusual problem, possibly with perception of breathing effort, or perhaps there is some unrecognized neurological problem affecting the breathing apparatus alone, such as a pinched diaphragmatic nerve or something, which could make breathing intermittenly difficult without upsetting the hemodynamics. It's a stretch, but if it's the case it wouldn't be the first time.   Again, best of luck, and do keep us updated.\n\n",

Depending on how hard you push, you could cause yourself some pain by smashing on the trachea.  It's unlikely that you would cause a significant amount of damage but it can be unpleasant.  There are a few places to check your pulse that are easier.  1st is the radial pulse that you can feel on the thumb side of your wrist (palm side not back of hand side).  Also, you can feel your pulse easily  by checking your carotid pulse which is located on either side of the neck in the \"groove\" between the midline and the strap muscles of the neck.    Simply place your fingers on one of these areas and press down gently to feel the pulse.  Only press hard enough to feel the pulse, no harder.  Using this method is safe.  In the neck, it is good to only press down and not \"massage\" the area as this can cause some heart dysrhythmias.  Also, don't check both sides of the neck at once, lest you risk cutting off a significant part of blood flow to the head.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Willa -  This is  an unusual situation, since all your vital signs seem to run contrary to the findings. There are some possible explanations, however, and most of them could be ruled in or out by means of an angiogram. For instance, there is a condition known as Right Ventricular Dysplasia, in which the wall of the RV is often paper-thin and somewhat dilated; with ARVD there is usually a family history and the patient usually complains  of frequent palpitations. This would likely have shown up during your echocardiogram, although it is more difficult sometimes  to get a good view of the RV using echo.   There is also the possibility of an old and unrecognized RV infarct (possibly a \"silent\" MI). This can cause dilation of the RV without the thinning seen in ARVD.   One other thing that could be ruled in/out via angiogram is extensive small coronary vessel disease of the RV, causing it to dilate to compensate.   If there is an actual PFO, the RV may have dilated in order to compensate as well. This is sometimes known as \"remodeling\" and sometimes such an abnormality has been known to more or less \"fix\" itself through such remodelling.   One other question arises: Have you ever used the Fen-Phen combination of drugs? It is now well established that many people who were prescribed this combination have developed PH.  Each problem requires a different therapeutic approach, so the angiogram would be a very useful. It is an invasive test that takes a day or two out of one's schedule, but since you don't have any symptoms it might actually be an  ideal window of opportunity to do this, as the associated (and normally very low)risks would be far less than if you were to begin  to develop symptoms.   The angiogram is certainly a personal choice for you. You might consider it if you should ever begin to experience any symptoms, and it may be that your abnormality is just a \"normal\" one - for you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your reply AJCalhoun- I have never taken Fen-Phen or any diet drugs.  But, almost 3 years ago I had a lumpectomy for breast cancer. I did not have chemo since the tumor was small and there was no lymph node involvement, but I did have radiation treatment on my right breast. A pre-surgery chest X-ray showed everything to be normal.    Could the radiation treatment be the cause of my tricuspid regurgitation and enlarged right ventricle?  The doctors I have asked could not give me a definitive answer to this question. Could the radiation damage small coronary vessels, and if so is there any remedy for this? The pulmonary hypertension specialist said that an alternative treatment for PH is l-arginine, I think it is an amino acid that can dilate blood vessels. I continue to feel fine, and have no symptoms.  Willa\n\n",

    "content": "You are very welcome.    The long-term effects of radiation therapy are not entirely understood and  can  vary a great deal from  one  person to the next. I can  well understand your doctor's not being able to give a definitive answer to your question, but given the rather random outcomes of any cohort of subjects who have undergone RT, it seems entirely possible that this could have had some effect on  underlying structures. There is, at this time, no way to know for certain, but it is within the realm  of possibility. If it is the culprit then the problem may not be as serious as PH often is, as it probably would not be progressive since it may have been  caused by an external factor rather than an internal one.   Given this new information and the fact that you report no symptoms, I am inclined to suspect the RT had something to do with the changes in your heart and that they will likely not progress beyond the present state. I would definitely continue to be followed and be certain that there is no progression of the condition, but as long as you otherwise feel well you probably have an unusually good outlook. I wouldn't shelve the whole issue, however, but feel strongly it should be checked semi-annually at least for now, and of course if any symptoms should develiop you should immediately bring them to the attention of your doctor.   I hope this is useful to you.\n\n",

I only ask these questions because i had a stress test/stress echo performed on me back in June, but today i read something on the internet and it said that if you eat a meal, you should wait a couple of hours before having these tests performed on you...   I did eat  a  meal (not a big meal) about 20 - 30 mins before the tests only because i didnt wanna jump onto a treadmill on an empty stomach....i do not recall the cardiologist saying anything to me about not eating....the only thing he told me to do was to wear comfortable running shoes...   i felt fine on the treadmill plus my tests were normal....everything should be ok right?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello borninbc - It is difficult to give a pat answer to your first question.  For complete digestion to take place it might take as much as 12 hours. However, for the sake of ordinary things like  exercise, if it is going to be serious exercise, then an hour at least, as the body's resources are being devoted to breaking  down the food and moving it out of the stomach  during the first hour.  Some people digest more slowly than others, though. Generally if one no longer has the typical \"full\" feeling then the  bolus of food has largely left the stomach. This is important for sevaral  reasons. One is the fact that the energy being used to digest the food is subtracted from that  available for exercise,  which puts a mild to moderate stress on all  the systems involved. Exercise is best accomplished when  nothing else is demanding attention.   Secondly, when food is still  in the stomach vigorous  exercise can upset the stomach, as there is then  competition for the energy and resources. This can also lead to reflux or regurgitation of food and, if swimming, can lead to muscle cramps in the extremities. Much depends, however, on the size of the meal. A heavy meal deserves an hour or more before vigorous  exercise.  A very light meal might  not place much demand on  the body, so a shorter delay would be in order.  Generally the symptoms  one would experience if exercising too soon  after eating would be indigestion, acid reflux, possible chest pain or heartburn,  and a lowered energy level leading  to less ability to exercise. If a person  were to have heart disease all these things would become more exaggerated and the heart could be stressed as well.  In the case of stress tests, especially with echo, doctors usually will  allow a light breakfast the day of the  test, a few hours beforehand,  and usually a light snack in between the treadmill portion and the  second set of pictures if a nuclear scan is done.  If it is a stress echocardiogram it's more important to keep the stomach relatively empty because the stomach is so close to  the heart that the presence of food in there can  make it difficult to visualize the  heart's structures.  (the heart normally rests just above the upper part of the stomach,  and food tends to collect there in defiance of logic, so can get in the way of the view).   Since your doctor didn't tell you to avoid eating and since there were no  complaints or problems with performing the test, my guess is everything went fine. You would have heard about it if the  light meal had interfered with anything. Sounds like it all worked out just  fine.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, i just got an echocardiogram done and the results are shown below, i wanted to know why my cardiologist said that my echo was normal when it shows \"the mitral valve has evidence of systolic flattening\", what is that. also is shows trivil tricuspid regurgitation, what is that? and what is trivial in regards to tricuspid regurgitation.  lastly are these two conditions or anything else in the report related to or show signs of Ventricular septal defect? i am 20 and male no history, no meds  thanks.  the aortic root is normal in size, measuring 2.9 cm across. the right ventrcle is normal in size, with normal systolic function. the right atrium is normal insize, measuring .6 cm in the apical views.  the left atrial volume index is normal, measuring .6 cm in the apical views.  the left atrial volume index is normal measuring 13.61 cc/m2.  the left ventricle is normal in size, with an end-diastolic diameter of 4.3 cm, and an end-systolic diameter of .9 cm. wall thickness is normal, with the septum measuring .8 cm and the posterior wall measuring .9 cm across.  relative wall thickness was normal at .42, and the LV mass index was 65.8g/m2 consistent with normal left ventricular mass.  regional and global left ventricular systolic function appears normal with a visually estimated ejection fraction of 65%.  mitrral inflow patterns reveal an E:A ration of 1.5, with a deceleration time of 173 msec., consistent with normal diastolic function.  the doppler derived stroke volume equals 90 ccs.  all valves appear structurally normal.  the mitral valve has evidence of systolic flattening.  there is trivial tricuspid regurgitation. right atrial pressures as assessed by IvC dynamics are normal at 5-10 mmHG. the estimated PA systolic pressure is 32 mmHG.  there is normal systolic/diastolic flow in the pulmonary vein indicating normal left atrial pressures.  there is no evidence of pericardia effusion, intracavity mass, thrombi, or vegetation.\n\n",

Trivial or mild tricupid regurgitation is normally found in healthy general population up to an extent of 40 %. So your Echo is normal, don't be unduly bothered about it !\n\n",

I had an ECHO done 1 month ago, it showed nothing new. Should i worry? Should i contact my doctor?

    "title": "chest pains",
    "content": "Chest pains that radiate to the left arm as you have described are often symptomatic of cardiac ischemia, or lack of oxygen to the heart muscle.  The heart muscle gets a cramp, so to speak, and blood flow is impeded to your body which deprives your tissues of much needed oxygen.  It would be important to know if rest or sublingual Nitroglycerin relieved your symptoms, which would be a positive indicator of ischemia.  Since your recent echo was unchanged it may be more likely that coronary artery disease is the contributing factor.  I would suggest that you visit your cardiologist so he can judge if a cardiac catheterization is in order to look at your heart vessels for blockages.  Heart vessels impede blood flow two ways, by blockages and/or spasm.  Your doctor can discern if either is happening to you.  My final recommendation is if you smoke, quit.  Karen Marshall RN\n\n",

His chest pains started when he was running he didn't black out or anything, When he's upset and/or gets mad he gets chest pains in the center of his chest. holding in his anger only makes his chest hurt more. He's 19 years old 5'9'' and 150lbs. He also has mood swings, spasms when he's irritated or aggravated, mostly tired even after a good nights rest. He had an (ekg) before about two years ago and the said that nothing was wrong since then it's gotten worse and I think that maybe it's just anxiety.  He wants to play basketball but can't because of his chest problem. I'm wondering if I should really concerned about these chest pains he's having. I ask that you please respond as soon as possible.

    "title": "Persistent Chest Pain over last month",
    "content": "I am a 29 year old male who is very active. I lift weights Mon-Wed-Fri and do 20 minutes of high intensity circuit running Tues-Thur-Sat. About 10 weeks ago I woke with a strange feeling that my heart was racing. Not sure what to do, I called 911.  I went to emergency and the EKG was normal and blood test showed that no heart damage enzymes were released. My AST and ALT were a little high. Over the next few days I was uncomfortably aware of my heart beat but that went away. Over the next six weeks I carried on with my exercise routine and diet as normal and I didn't experience any pain.  About 4 weeks ago I woke up in the middle of the night again with the same feeling. I convinced myself that it was all in my head and went back to bed. Again I was uncomfortably aware of my heart beat for a few days. After a couple of days I started to feel a little pain in my chest. I would describe it as a slight, tight and pinching feeling in the center.  I went to see my PCP who said given my age and the normal EKG from the ER, I should be fine. I asked to see a cardiologist just for peace of mind.  The cardiologist gave me an EKG and checked my pulse over the entire body and did some listening and he said everything was normal. He suggested I put on a 24 hour monitor. I scheduled the appointment for a week and a half later as I had to go out of town. Since the chest pains have started I know that anxiety has become an issue. I don't know if it was the initial problem but it is one now as every time I feel a pain I think negative and I can feel an adrenaline release that makes it worse. While I was out of town (over the last week and a half) the chest pains have been growing steadily worse. In the beginning I would define them as a level 1 pain and now I would say they are level 3. I am experiencing shortness of breathe and the pain lasts all day. When I wake up in the morning I feel fine but after an hour or two it starts and lasts until I go to bed. After I returned home I did go into the emergency room again and the EKG and blood tests were normal again. I did the 24 hour monitor but won't receive the results until this coming Wednesday. Three nights ago I was feeling the pain fairly intense and I was afraid it was my heart again. I decided to go for a run. My thinking was, if this is my heart we'll just find out. Maybe that was foolish but I did my regular run and pushed almost as hard as normal and immediately after I actually felt better. There was almost no pain. Last night I did the same thing. The pain didn't go away as well but it was less intense after the run. I know that anxiety is an issue here since I get nervous because of the pain but I really don't believe anxiety can be the cause. I am generally happy in life and not too stressed. Besides, the pain is almost a constant tightness. Sometimes I feel it on the left and sometimes on the right. Mostly right in the center. A lot of times it is a slight burning sensation just under my sternum. I also feel it up in my lower neck from time to time. If that wasn't enough there are \"popping\", \"shooting\", and \"stabbing\" sensations. The popping and shooting feeling unnerve me but the stabbing hurts. Yesterday I was having an irregular beating feeling in my upper abdomen. I think that is about it.  I really appreciate your time in considering these matters. I believe I could rest easier if I just knew what this is. Is it possible with several normal EKGs and the running that I have done that this could be my heart? If not the heart, then what could cause these pains? Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi aminks,  You have given a very detailed history, thanks.  On clinical grounds you do not seem to have cardiac pain. However it is advisable to undergo a Stress EKG as well as a Color Doppler Echocardiogram. Likely diagnosis would be a Mtral Valve Prolapse syndrome, a benign condition where one of the heart valves is a little long and it \"skids\" while closing under force. This is not considered actually a disease and is a normal variation.   Second possibility is aGastroesophgeal reflux. This is a form of Acidity disorder where acid from the stomach rushes back in the foodpipe and mimicks the heart pain.  I recommend the following tests:  1. Echocardiogram. 2. Stress electrocardiogram 3. Upper GI Endoscopy.  Apurva Madia\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mike,  A subcostal view is routinely done when having a transthoracic echocardiogram.  Asking you to take a deep breath and hold can be due to many reasons while having an echocardiogram.  The right atrium can be seen on other views besides the subcostal view.  The murmur of an asd and pulmonary stenosis occur roughly during the same time of the heart cycle, that's why (especially in kids who have very fast heart rate), it is sometimes difficult to tell which is which and the best thing is to have an echocardiogram done.

    "content": "I turned 36 today. Yesterday, I had a second follow-up with my internist regarding chest pain (midline and to the right) and shortness of breath. On the first visit, he tapped my back and listened to me breathe. He had wondered about asthma, but the ENT tried to treat me for asthma with AdVair the week before, with no change in my condition. The doctor wondered about viral pleurisy, and wanted me to wait a few more days, which I did, but today he has ruled that out.  Today, the chest x-rays read as normal, as did the EKG. They drew blood - I don't know what to test for. He then listened to my heart with his stethoscope and got kind of quiet. He said something about hearing a murmur. He didn't say what level or anything. Next week, I am being sent for a Stress ECHO, but the doctor was very non-talkative about why I am going for the test. I know that he cannot say something without being sure after tests, but he only said that they were \"ruling things out\". I have no history of heart trouble. I am on meds for depression and hypothyroidism, but am an otherwise healthy person.  What am I missing here? What are they looking for with the ECHO? What are the odds of something actually being wrong with my heart? This is going to be a long week to wait until the tests, and then another long wait to see the doc again.  I'm not looking for a diagnosis here, but in all reality, what could they be looking for in a healthy 36 year old woman with no heart trouble history? Thanks for any info that you can offer.\n\n",

Even though I'm not terribly stressed about whatever my problem is, it is not easy to wait... mostly it's not easy to wait because I just don't feel well and want to figure out a way to start feeling better. The waiting game is frustrating. I'm not running through horrible scenarios in my mind, but taking it easy because you don't feel well is enough to make you go nuts - no matter what is happening in your body.  I am also readying myself for the tests in regards to my own sense of modesty. I do not like to be \"uncovered\" in any public (and YES - the doctor's office is public, with different people who come and go) situation. I sucked it up and made it through the chest x-rays and EKG last week, but I didn't have much time to think about it.   I know that \"these people are professionals and they do this every day\", but I don't... and it is important to me that they take measures to make me as covered-up and comfortable as the test will allow.   I know that they need to be able to \"get to\" different parts of me before, during and after the tests, but I would also like them to stop their assembly line procedure long enough to realize that I may have modesty issues that are different from their last patient... or from their own. I find that medical folks often have no concept of their patients' attitudes and beliefs, and I think that is careless and insenstitive.   I won't hold up the testing and get them off schedule, but I will be asking for some assistance in maintaining my modesty as much as the situation will allow. I am a very compliant patient, but this is one area where I will ask for something that they may not consider a big deal.  How pathetic is it that the procedure of the testing is more troubling to me than the results at this point?   Also sending out a kind thought to anyone who is reading this - I guess you wouldn't be looking around this site if you or a loved one weren't having a situation of your own. Good luck and take care.[/b]\n\n",

    "content": "Just popping in with an update - meager as it is.  The doctor called me today (on a Saturday afternoon - weird) and said that the stress ECHO had been sent to the cardiologist (we don't have one in my town) and that he had seen something that \"didn't look quite right\" with an inferior vessel. My doc wants me to see the cardiologist - they'll set up and appointment and call to tell me when.  I want to talk to my doctor and ask him about some options, and whether he wants to take on part of this or not. I still have a very specific pain in my back - right side, mid back in the rib area - and I'd like to know what that is about. If they are going to want me to lie down for any kind of tests that take more than a few minutes, we're going to have to work on that spot first. I'd like to know if it is related to the chest pain.  I don't know if the cardiologist wants to mess around with some of this, or if my doctor will refer me to someone else first. I was wondering about having:  -X-rays that would be read by an osteopath or someone else  in the bone/muscle field.  -An MRI to see if there is anything happening that shouldn't be. (They can do contrast, etc. right?)  -Another stress ECHO so that they can check that vessel.  I don't know who would handle the different areas/tests, but I will ask the doc and see what he says. My doc mentioned an angio, but he said that the cardiologist would decide that. (I hope that I get to decide that, too.) That's a pretty invasive procedure and I think that there is a lot between where I am now and that test.  I am apparently not in any danger, so I don't need to rush into anything. My chest is pretty dang painful and I'm moving slower than my 92 year old grandma, but I want to make sure that we touch all of the bases.  I don't know anything about cardiologists and their reputations. Will there be some good bedside manners or will I be on the assembly line? I'm all for efficency, but not at the expense of my health care.   I'll update when I get more info. If the kind doctor here would like to put in a few words, I'd be happy to hear something.  As I've been saying: I don't feel sick at all... except that I feel like I'm going to drop dead.      Have a good day, all.\n\n",

About 3 months ago my wife fell ill in relation to her pregnancy and I have been suffering sleep depravation and bad diet, also my excerise came to a halt.  About 4 weeks into this night mare I started to suffer chest pains, dizziness, weekness and gastric problems - which I put down to sleep depravation. I had a health screen.  I fasted on the day for bloods, then took a treadmill test. I got to level 6, before they finally got my heart over its calculated max of 182. I had a little pain on the rcovery which I put down to tea and biscuit prior to the test, but this prolong my recovery, which is normally fast.   The result showed a T Wave Inversion from lead III at rest before the test and that the ECG was borderline.  I have read abit, and wondered if recent hectic lifestyle could have caused this and are there other possibilties relating to bad sleep, diet and gastric probs - like hypokalemia?  Is a T Wave inversion a warnign signal to slow down, or change life style?\n\n",

Dear Ashish,Its nice to know that you exercise 4-5 times daily and do not smoke or drink. You have not said so but i presume that you do not get short of breath or have chest pain while exerting.  Now at your age and with your lifestyle the most common reason for inverted T in ECG is \"non specific\" meaning that it does not relate to any specific disease condition and is just there. Again I would qualify this statement by adding that you have not given details of which Leads of the EKG are showing these T inversions. If they are in \"Inferior\" leads, mostly they are of no importance.  In any case you have been very rightly advised to go for a TMT as this test is more sensitive and will resolve the matter and give the correct cause of your T wave inversion.  Dr Apurva Madia  :)\n\n",

Once its normal, you are not sufferring from 'Angina' or ' Heart attack'. The description you have given of your symptoms would also point to a condition of Acid Peptic disease with gastro esophageal reflux disease [GERD] wherein stomach acid regurgitates back in your food pipe. Yoe need to consult a gastroenterologist and need to undergo an Upper GI Endoscopy.  Apurva Madia : :)\n\n",

    "content": "About 3 weeks ago, I thought I was having a heart attack and my wife took me to the ER. I was admitted to the hospital for observation. I was told that my cardiac enzymes were normal, my Ekg was fine, and that my xray showed a slightly enlarged heart but that it was ok. The next day they did a stress echo and said that showed my heart was fine. I was not referred to a cardiologist. This was all done by my family doctor. Well, I did get a copy of my ekg and it read: Sinus rhytum. Inferior T wave changes, consider ischemia early transition- cannot rule out old posterior MI  RSR' in V1, normal variant.  I also  had a lipid panel done recently and found out that I have high cholesterol and all my other levels on those labs were outside of normal limits. I have been having chest pain on and off for about 6 years now. I had a stress test done about 4 years ago and they said it was fine. I do have an appointment with a cardiologist next week. This was only due to me asking for the referral. My family doctor didn't think I needed to see one. I tried to be brief in the history. My question is does this EKG seem questionable and what does it mean? Also, did I make the right move in requesting to see a cardiologist? Thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mmansur,  Ofcourse it is always right to ask for a referral especially when you are in doubt...or else you will be you in continous stress all the time because you are concerned about your heart condition and that can cause cardiac problems as well!   Listen... your EKG is good...you cannot judge inferior t-wave changes unless you have an old EKG to compare it with and see if that's new.  I am concerned about your repeated attacks of chest pain(can you describe it?)...and your high lipid profile. I suggest you to cut down the fat in your food and increase your healthy habits and start doing a light exercise.  There are a lot of factors predispose to Ischemic heart diseases...includes smoking, drinking alcohol, high fat intake,genetic predisposition(does any of your family have heart problems?) , if you are hypertensive, if you are diabetic, and the list goes on, you can read about it in our website in the cardiology section :   http://www.doctorslounge.com/clinlounge ... angina.htm  but I think if the stress test was all right ...then there are no worries...provided that it was done correctly ....it shows the electrical activity of the heart during stress...and this is a simple test to show if the heart is having enough blood supply when you are doing effort/ in stress or not.  That's all for now, Best wishes,\n\n",

Some plaque beginning to build in right artery.  I was referred to a cardiologist.  Another EKG was done.  It also showed I had had a heart attack.  I couldn't tell you when.  I am now being told I need a stress test with an echocardiogram.  The pains in my chest have become less frequent, but I have a spot in my back that aches.  It also feels sore in that spot.

That's wht you call a dynamic EKG...so we compare it to an old one... if your stress test is fine....and you still have these pains...please do the echocardiogram and there are also a lot of other causes for chest pain not necessarily the heart..including oesophagitis , myositis,etc... you can check them out in our site here.

    "content": "hi,   my 13 year old son had an ECG today. it says that he has sinus bradycardia with premature supraventricular complexes.  should we be concerned? he is autistic and has tardive dyskinesia from an antipsychotic he was given when he was 8. lately he has been sweating very badly at night while sleeping and his reynaud's syndrome has been acting up. could these symptoms be related to the findings on this ECG? he has joined the wrestling team. should we allow him to continue working out or wait until we know more? his last ECG done 6 months ago was normal but did show early repolarization. My sister died unexpectedly of a heart attack when she was 13..thirty some years ago.   thank you for answering my multitude of question.\n\n",

Is this serious? My doctor didnt seem to overly concerned, he sent me home and told me to come back in 1 week. I had a stress test in Dec of last year and everything was fine. I also had a high Lipase count...not too high, like 272 and normal is 118-246 I think.   I am a worrier though, should I be overly concerned about the abnormal t wave thing? I have been having chest pains, not bad, more of a burning and a dull ache than anything else, some dizziness and shortness of breath. I also have bad stomach problems......acid reflux real bad, and gastritis.   Please tell me what you think....like I said, my doctor didnt seem too worried about it, should I be?\n\n",

    "title": "Short PR interval - Wolfe Parkinson White",
    "content": "Subject: My athletic 16 y/o Hisp/Amer. son. 160#, 5\u20196\u201d with chest pains and rapid heart rate. Over 3 months he self managed a 20 pound weightloss program utilizing low carbohydrate/high protein diet, whey protein shakes and wtlifting/workouts.  Per my snoop/investigate no other supplements used. At the time of these incidents, only medication he was taking was Pannaz for sinus congestion \u2013 this was d/c when the chest pains episodes began.  Hx:  1. Oct, 05 c/o of bad chest pain w/episodes of racing heart beat \u2013  increasing over a couple of weeks.  He could make the pain stop by lying down and bringing his knees up to his chest.  Make racing heart slow by walking around real fast to \u201ccatch up to his heart\u201d.  At times the pain is not associated with a racing heart.  Some occurrences have not even been related to workouts occuring during unstressful times \u2013 e.g. Sun. morning at church; Sat. night playing cards. 2. Pain described as \u201ca cramping up\u201d or \u201csomeone sitting on my chest\u201d, sometimes, a sharp pain occurs w/ deep breaths. 3. When he was a small child, I recall feeling his heart beating hard \u2013 pediatrician never heard anything abnormal so no testing was ever prescribed 4. That Oct. weekend he also had 2 incidents c/o of total exhaustion, once was after a bout of racing heart and chest pain, the other seemed unrelated to pain/racing heart. 5. Family Dr. did office EKG \u2013 noticed a short PR interval and wanted to rule out pericarditis and Wolfe Parkinson White syndrome, so he initiated a 24 hour monitor and sent us to cardio for ultrasound. 6. Echo/u.s. normal with no unusual anatomy noted. The cardiac event mon. read by a cardio and the study revealed numerous runs of Supraventricular tachycardia with rate as high as 150. 7. Inderal 10 mg BID prescribed and was taken on Wed.PM and again on Thurs.AM. On Thurs. PM, he wanted to change his window blinds, and after about 10 min. of working in this overhead reach position, he climbed down off the chair complaining of pain and exhaustion, sat down on the end of the bed, and then went down on the floor c/o being so exhausted he couldn\u2019t move.  BP was 110/40 and pulse 40 - 45. Remained conscious w/feet elevated to prevent syncopal episode.  Skin cool, clammy, very pale. MD notified and the Inderal reduced to 5 mg BID. A reduced dose that PM and on Fri. AM. Then Inderal d/c per order of the EPstudycardiologist. 8. EP study on following Monday A.M. \u2013 Dr. said that he could not induce an abnormal rhythm (other than sinus tachycardia with an Isuprel infusion) but did express concern that during the study, my son woke up in severe chest pain associated with the sinus tachycardia \u2013 concluded that EP was considered normal, but the fact of the severe chest pain during the stimulation was not and should be investigated and followed up.  No ablation occurred; no need for pacemaker. 9. He was placed on a 30 day event monitor \u2013 only several minor \u201cuncomfortable\u201d chest feelings which he recorded.  There have been neither further bad chest pain nor heart racing episodes since the EP study. 10. Now that we are taking his pulse, his pulse seems to run between 45 and 75.   11. The original cardio has informed me that he does not know why my son is having these incidents and believes that the chest pain does not correlate with anything \u2013 therefore, he will outgrow it.  Problem:  I am his Mother \u2013 I feel very concerned about just \u201cletting him outgrow\u201d something that we don\u2019t know what it is.  I just want to be sure that he will outgrow everything, just keep growing period -- I want to know what it is that he can outgrow.   Question:  What other avenues should be investigated to get to the bottom of a \u201cshort PR interval\u201d and and racing heart rate and chest pain that doesn\u2019t seem to correlate with anything?  Where do I turn now?  What questions do I need to ask of  the cardiologist or the family doc?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   My name is Patrick. I'm a 37 yr old male roughly 150 pounds..I've been diagnosed with SVT about 4 years ago, even though I've had this condition for most of my life. My episodes could happen maybe once every 2 to 3 yrs and last 5min up to 1 hour. It seems as though when it does occur it's always when I'm bending over to pick something up or getting up from kneeling down. Last night was working on a Bathroom floor on my hands and knees smoothing concrete for about 30 min when I stood up I went into SVT. I tried to convert it but the only way I knew how to was to bare down and hold breath. Can you tell me if there's any other ways to convert that have been successful in other people. I would greatly appreciate any advice...  P.S. I do not want to go through the Catheter Ablation  Thanks    Patrick\n\n",

    "content": "Brief history:  My brother passed away very suddenly when he was 6 1/2.  This was almost 13 years ago.  I just got a copy of his autopsy report last week.  The medical examiner called me himself and said it was extremely important that my children's pediatrician have a copy of the report.  The main findiing was endocardial fibroelastosis as a result of dilated cardiomyopathy.  He also had left ventricular hypertrophy as part of all this.  We had always kind of suspected Long QT syndrome as part of this.  So, all 4 of my kids have had ekg's done now.  3 of them came back with left ventricular hypertrophy.  My daughter had a murmur diagnosed last weekend.  I was told the sounds they heard are consistent with atrial septal defect - but her ekg was fine.  My pediatrician said he is not a cardiologist, but has no problem getting us into one to discuss all this.  He told me though that we had nothing to worry about.  He told me he felt that the LVH was not significant since the cardiologist that read the ekg's did not call him personally about it.  He also said the ASD with my daughter was nothing to worry about since the ekg was fine.  I'm VERY confused.  I've been reading that LVH is commonly missed on ekg's.  So, how is it that 3 of my kids may have it?  Why is my concern being dismissed since we do have a familial history of that related to a sudden death in a child?    Also with the ASD, my daughter is 5 1/2, so it's my understanding that it will not close on its own now.    Am I way off base with my concern?  Is it probably best to have a consult with a pediatric cardiologist and look into all of this further??  Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "T.M.J. or cardio related??",
    "content": "Sorry about my other posting about \"is there a doctor in the house\" I was not familiar with how this forum works. anyway, I am a 26 year old male 5,8 tall and around 185 lbs. I used to be alot heavier than that. I  once weighed 235 lbs. This all started around 4 years ago when  I was 22, One night I was just sitting at home when I began to feel mild chest pain and numbness in my left arm. At this I instantly began having anxiety attacks thinking that i was having a Heart attack. this is when I began walking 2 to 4 miles daily and lost the extra pounds.  This went on for about 1 year and I got to the doctor to have it looked at. I have actualy been to 3 doctors over the last 4 years and all have told me that It is not my heart. All my bloodwork was good  with bad cholesterol of only 174. I have not had any x-rays done  but my blood pressure is always good, even when I am having pain, usualy between 130 over 70 to 139 over 80. My mother works in the medical field and she has listened to all 4 chambers of my heart and detects no abnormalities. Just recently, probably with in the last year my jaw has began to hurt as well.  when there is a lot of sound in a small area my hearing gets \"staticy\" like a distorting speaker. I have pain in my chest,sometimes brief but sharp and sometimes burning. also stiff sholders and neck and not limited to just the left side. I have also had tooth pain, headace, and the most worring part, Numbness. The numbness alternates where it takes place, sometimes my hands but recently has been my feet, one time I had numbness in all 4 limbs at once and felt dizzy for a moment.all of these symptoms come and go vering in intensity. I do alot of research on the internet  and this all matches T.M.J. symptoms, and my jaw does pop when I push on the joint and open my mouth, but the anxiety mounts and I feel like \"what if The doctors are wrong?\" \"what if I have something wrong?\" I get really scared and usualy get in the car and drive to the hospital E.R. but by the time I get there the symptoms are dissapating and i just turn around and go home. I really need reassurance that I do not have a heart problem, I try to tell myself all the positive things I mentioned but anxiety still takes control. I am now taking st.Johns Wort and it seems to help keep me calm. sorry for the legnth of this post but I needed to tell you all that I could. Thanks for being there.\n\n",

    "content": "Bumping this up for you so someone will see it... AND to add my thoughts.    To ease your mind, your symptoms really do sound like something much more skeletomuscular in nature. Neck/back problems can cause numbness and pain in the areas you've described. TMJ is also another viable option in what's possibly ailing you.  Take a deep breath. Look at the statistics. You are young with good lab work. You've lost the weight. Are you maintaining that weight loss with a healthy diet? No smoking? Regular exercise? If not, make these lifestyle changes if you can. Your blood pressure is within a reasonable range as well. Your risk factors seem to be very low, from what you've described.  Anxiety seems to be an issue for you. I would be anxious too if I thought I was having a heart attack!! I'm glad the St. John's Wort is working for you, but have you spoken to your physician about your anxiety?? An anxiety attack can also mimic the symptoms of heart problems... shortness of breath, feeling sweaty, etc. Please talk to your doc about this. Anxiety is nothing to be ashamed of, and there are ways of treating it. You deserve to feel better!! I honestly think that if you address the anxiety issue, you will resolve a lot of your symptoms.   Also, a visit to the dentist to confirm a TMJ diagnosis might also be very beneficial, both to discuss treatment options and to calm you.  Good luck to you, and I hope you can get a resolution to your problem. Please feel free to post anytime you have questions.\n\n",

    "content": "Yes, that does have something to do with it.  During a cardiac arrest, blood flow to the brain can be considerably decreased. This can lead to some brain damage due to lack of oxygen (which the blood normally brings), which is why you're seeing the behavior your friend is exhibiting.   I'm sure that a neurologist has been consulted for your friend, and it sounds as though rehab may be in his future, if he doesn't improve, once he's stable enough to go to that sort of unit. As a friend, you can give the most support by visiting and bringing reminders of his life, like pictures. Talk to him, give reassurance, and have patience. A lot of people with a brain injury do things that are not rational, or that may even hurt your feelings. This is NOT intentional.   Good luck to your friend and thanks for visiting The Doctor's Lounge.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 37, no family history of heart disease, blood work all fine for cholesterol, sugars, etc.  I have a history of costrocondritis of left chest wall, Meniers disease, and GERD.  I have been having chest pressure, pain in shoulder blades, sometimes worsening with movement. I have recently started walking 2 miles a day for a week now when all these symptoms in my back started.  I do have anxiety due to my Meniers symptoms and do take medication for this.  I also have a pain in my left shoulder which worsens with movement when lifting up my left arm.  The pain in my chest when I would walk would be pin-point and go as fast as it came only lasting not even a second.  I would get it left side, or right side, never the same and not all the time.  I was sent to physical therapy for back pain a while back and the therapist hit a trigger point in my low back that sent the same pains radiating into my left chest, neck and jaw and down my left arm.  I have had a 24 hour holter monitor-EKG's both being negative 2 yrs ago.  I have been troubled with the left sided costrocondritis for around 8 years now.  I get worried being everything seems to be left sided and the same as cardiac symptoms??  Please help.\n\n",

Just seems to be taking longer this time to get into my system and work?  As far as the chest pain, its more like pressure feeling in the front, the pain is actually through my shoulder blades.  When I have someone rub my back, he says its hard as a rock and very painful to rub.  When I bend over forward the pressure in my chest is relieved.  Could this be fibromyalgia?  I cannot really take muscle relaxers cause with my Menier's it just seems to aggrivate the dizziness of that.  I do take Tylenol for pain only when it gets really bad.  Do you recommend ice or heat for the back pain?? Thanks\n\n",

Chest pressure and pains all around it also result from stress in many people who have been cleared for any cardiac involvement.  There are conflicting views about cold vs. heat. Cold tenses people up, so I recommend heat, it is a natural muscle relaxer.  Do you feel some better after a hot shower?  Try a heating pad at home, do some deep breathing, take some time every day JUST for yourself and try to unwind.  GERD is also aggravated by stress, because stess and tension cause excess gas and stomach acid to be produced.  Do stay on the Protonix.\n\n",

    "title": "BP 160/100",
    "content": "I'm way overweight, and up to about three months been living a seditary lifestyle for awhile and had palpitations. I went to my doctor who gave me an ecg, physical, and blood work and said that I was okay, but I was worried so I asked for a stress test. That weekend I felt lightheaded so I went to the hospital since the doctor had told me if I felt lightheaded/dizzy I should go to the hospital. There I had another ECG, Bloodwork, and Chest X-rays plus another physical examination (The stethescope and listening to the heart) The doctor there also told me that I was okay and when I came in my BP was like 159/95 or something but the last time they took my BP before I left it was 136/90 or something like that.  Anyway I went to the doctor for the stress test who gave me another ecg but not a stress one, and she took my blood pressure and it was 160/100. But then I talked to the doctor and he assured me that I was fine, but warned me that if I didn't change my ways I wouldn't be so lucky 5 to 10 years from now and then we walked to his room (I was feeling much better because I believe what he said) and he took my blood pressure again and this time it was 130/80. He then proceeded to tell me that I had to ask for a large arm cuff and that small ones would give inaccurate readings.  Anyway zoom about a month or so later when I start my job which is like about 2 hours of cleaning it's pretty intensive I sweat bullets so I figured I was probably doing good healthwise. Anyway they decide they want to try cleaning the building in an hour and half so I start worrying and my palpitations come back, but after the weekend they went away but then I started to feel kind of lightheaded dizzy all the time. It would become more pronounced when towards the ends of my walks or when I was at work but never got to the point where I couldn't stand sometimes I would lean to one side or stumble but it was rare.   I began freaking out so I went to my doctor again and she checked my blood pressure which was 160/100 and listened to my heart but said that I was suffering from anxiety not heart realated issues. Anyway I had a fasting glucose and lipid panel and continued to feel lightheaded and dizzy pretty much asuring myself that I was dying. Went to another doctor since I noticed my dizzyness got a bit more noticible after exercising which freaked me out and I found that dizzyness can be associated with CHF and Cartiroid Artery Disease and thus went to another doctor who said my BP was 150/100 and my esting heart rate was 120!  That scared me and she perscribed effexor and atenolol, but I didn't take it until reffering to my main doctor who has my history and such. She said that there is nothing wrong, that it's my anxiety and that I should just try to ignore it or take the fluoxetine she perscribed and that I don't need to worry so much.   Oh my fasting glucose was low so she told me to eat 3 meals and 3 snacks a day to keep it regular and that it could be partly causing my lightheadedness. My HDL was above 1.1mmol and she said my cholesterol and stuff was normal- not optimal.   Anyway I told her my concerns about my HBP and Heart Rate, and that I thought they would go down after 2 months of exercise, but she said not to worry about it and that I am still very overweight. She told me that I should just keep doing what I am doing (Eating right, and exercising daily) and they will come down in time.  I should also note that while that one doctor said my heart rate was 120, I have taken my heart rate after exercising while lying down and my heart rate while sitting and when I am lying don it takes about 10 minutes to drop to anywhere between 75-85 beats a minute and when I am sitting it will usually go o about 85-90.  Anyway is there any reason that she would not believe that my dizziness was caused by my hbp and that I don't need medication? I am thinking that my anxiety was raising my heart rate and BP which is why she doesn't think I need medication.\n\n",

    "content": "Your doctor is correct; you have been cleared for heart disease (at the moment), your blood pressure and pulse go to normal when you relax.  I recommend you do what she said about eating small meals (not junk food) every 3 hours and don't skip meals. This way you avoid low blood sugar and the dizziness that accompanies it.  Try the medication; it will probably help immensely.  You will probably have strange side effects at first, that is to be expected.  Give it at least three weeks, unless the side effects are serious.  But don't rely on just the meds to do it all, do continue your excercise, eat right, get plenty of sleep, no caffeine or alcohol.  I hope you feel better soon!\n\n",

Obviously I can't rule out a heart cause over the internet but your description does point in another direction. Have you perhaps lifted something heavy?  If you did it just the wrong way, you could have that kind of pain.  You might try some advil twice a day, it sounds musculoskeletal.    Age 19 is too young (although not unheard of) to worry about coronary artery disease (that causes heart attacks), the plaque that blocks arteries accumulates over many years.  The fluttering in your chest sounds like palpitations, probably PVCs which are nothing to worry about, they happen to everyone at some point.  To avoid them, excercise regularly, eliminate caffiene, alcohol, sugar, get at least 8 hours of sleep every night and reduce your stress level as much as possible.  If the advil does not help, see your doctor.\n\n",

My dr sent me for a stress echo and since i used to do cardiac telemetry the clinician who did my stress echo after was quite candid with me . he stated that my ecg part of the test seemed normal yet my echo part showed a \"sluggesh\" part of the left ventricular wall.this was after the stress part had finished. he said that it was clearly visable on both windows and showed it to me. now being from the field im no where nearly as edjucated asthe cardiologist however i know that could be indicative  and i stress could not that it is to an artery problem.  Now here is my question.. When I was in the hopsital recently. i was given some medication that hardend the veins where the medication was administered and traveld all the way up to the shoulder.  There isnt any way that this medication can do this anywhere else in the body is it?   The Dr. asked me if the palpitations i had comboned with the sharp pain and nausia was when i was exersising. I thought that was funny because i get short of breath as soon as i hit a flight of stairs. so i said No its only when i get up or if i get starteled (sp).. When i was hospitalized 2003 for the same thing the noticed that the enzyme in the CPK panel that shows muscle damage or harm was elevated yet they never took it any further they said that it was insignificant. since then i have had this problem. Could you please sshed some light on what this all could mean? Thankyou\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Celeste012,  If you don't have any major risk factors for coronary disease including hypertension, diabetes, family history of early coronary disease (in first degree relatives), high cholesterol, smoking, being above 50 (in males) and 60 (in females) and being a male.  Females of the child bearing age are naturally protected from coronary disease unless they have had major coronary risk factors for many years.  What kind of stress echo was it? Was it a treadmill or a chemical test? If it was a treadmill, how long did you stay on the treadmill and did you reach your target heart rate?  i can't judge what your cardiologist saw but i believe that he saw something. What did he decide to do regarding this, did he want it pursued or he thought  it is not significant?  Seeing an abnormal motion on the echo after stress could mean that you have coronary disease or a false positive result.  Being short of breath when climbing stairs or when performing any exercise could be due to many causes starting with being non-fit physically and ending with heart failure or lung failure. You have to have a regular echo to check for the ejection fraction of the left ventricle (how well the heart contracts) and rule out diastolic dysfunction (abnormal relaxation of the left ventricle).  If you don't have any major risk factors for coronary disease, i don't think you should be worried especially that the symptoms that you are complaining from are atypical as compared to the symptoms of coronary disease.  Regaring the cpk, it can elevated from many things as well. There is another enzyme that is now usually tested called troponin that is most people consider far more important than the cpk.  i can' t really tell what is the vein hardening medication that you took and what is its effect unless i have its name.

My Father has hypertension,cad with a pretty high percentage of blockage. he has had this problem for the past 20 yers hes now 64. My mother im not sure about only because she refuses to discuss it.. I am a fit 32 5'7\" 145lbs woman.  The shortness of breath with sharp chest pain and nasea only happens when i get startled if i jump up quickly or if i lean foward or sit up from a flat position.  The shortness of breath also will happen suddenly if i stop moving (like climbing stairs).  I had a normal echo wich stated that i had minimal regurgitaion  in th e mitral  tricuspid and the Pulmonic was not well visualised the left ventrical was at at 58% if that makes sense and right was greater than 60%  The stress test was on a tread mill i went about 9 minutes and my heart rate was right at about 168 beats. I have not heard from the Dr. yet so i am just waiting to hear from him.  I am a normally healthy person other than this heart problem lol this whole thing started in 1992 when i had passed out while at work (ironically a hospital) when they hooked me up they noticed that the heart was beating very fast and having pvc episodes.  they werent able to figure out what it was but showed some concern due to being tachicardic with heart rates at 170 ironically wich is the same thing i am going through now. and last year...  I am pretty sure its nothing i think its the jolt in he chest then trying to keep from fainting scares me. Thankyou\n\n",

The story now is totally different, i think you should be seen by an electrophysiologist if you were not already seen and evaluated by one, these episodes of tachycardia leading to syncope have to be evaluated. i think something else has to be looked for and not coronary disease.

    "content": "I am 32, but I do have a family history of heart disease.  I am not a diabetic, but I am overweight, have mildly high cholesterol (although my \"good\" cholesterol is very high), my blood pressure usually runs about 140/90 so that's been a concern as well.  I have hypothyroidism and Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.  My chest pains are very frequent & they last not even 2 seconds but they sometimes take my breath away.  I had a stress echo 2 years ago and a nuclear stress test about a year ago.  Both came back normal & I did not have any pain while on the treadmill & had no problem reaching my goal heart rate.    My biggest question is:  How long after the above tests can one start developing blockage?  If my nuclear scan was normal a year ago - should I be ok the next year, next 5 years, etc.?  I don't want to assume that I am still ok a year later, but I don't know how fast things like this can change.  I'm sure it's different depending on risks, etc.  Any insight would be very much appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Palpitations and HBP -- Holter results",
    "content": "About 4 weeks ago, after years of normal blood pressure, my blood pressure went up to 156/100.  At the time, I felt breathless, weak, heart missing beats, and a sense of pressure in my chest.  Things calmed down after 30 minutes or so, but my blood pressure has been high ever since.  The doctor put me on HCT, for about a week, but my blood pressure stayed high and the palpitations increased in frequency.  She put me on Cardizem and ordered a 48-hr Holter monitor and a chest xray.  I just got the results of the Holter but don't see the doctor again for 2 weeks.  I have to assume this is not life-threatening or they would have called me, but I don't understand what is happening to me and I am worried.  I am feeling better since the Cardizem, fewer palpitations, but my BP is still running no lower than 140/90 mostly, with spikes of 150/100.   The impressions on the Holter says:  16 hours of recording (why not 48?)  Sinus rhythm. Ocassional ventricular premature contraction. Frequent atrial premature contraction, no atrial tachycardia. Patient complained of palpitations during the recording. Not much correlation with ectopics. Mostly reliable computer analysis of ectopics.  It reports 4 ventricular events, max of 1/minute, and 4/hour. No couplets, triplets or bigeminy runs. 497 supraventricular events, max of 8/minute and 178/hour, with amean of 31.1/hour and 14.2 SVE/1000. 1 couplet.  Heart rates: min 45, max 113, avg 64. 35 bradycardia runs, longest 23 beats.  Can you help me understand what this means and the possible cause for such a sudden change?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Bonnie,  i am not sure why there are only 16 hours of recording but sometimes the holter machine does not pick up the signal or the tracing is not good enough for analysis by the machine so it ignores it.  Explanation of the report: - Sinus rhythm: Base line rhythm is normal rhythm. - Occasional ventricular premature contractions: Rare early beats originating from the ventricles. You had only 4 of them. All occured within the same hour. Within very acceptable range. - Frequent atrial premature contractions: Frequent early beats originating from the atria. You had nearly 500 of them. i would say within acceptable range. No need to worry about these beats as there are no signs of them going into an irregular rhythm called atrial fibrillation from the analysis. - No atrial tachycardia: You did not have any continuous episodes of fast heart rate originating from the atria. - Patient complained of palpitations during the recording. Not much correlation with ectopics: When you felt the palpitations, you did not have any actual arrhythmias or extra beats at the time you felt them and when you were actually having the extra beats you either did not feel them or you did but you did not push the button. - Heart rates: min 45, max 113, avg 64:  Normal range of heart rates is between 60-100. You had heart rate below 60. If this was during sleep, it is very normal. Your maximum heart rate was 113 which is very acceptable during the day as well in case of activity. Your average heart rate was within normal range.  - 35 bradycardia runs, longest 23 beats.  You had 35 episodes of heart rate below 60 beats/minute, the longest of them was for 23 beats. Once again, if during sleep, this is normal.    What do you mean by your last question causes of this sudden change? And change from what? If you mean what causes the early beats, these can be caused by: - In your case, the sudden increase in the blood pressure can cause it. - Coronary disease, if thought to be present. - Mitral valve prolapse (a condition associated with palpitations, atypical chest pain in the other healthy young adult). - Hyperactive thyroid gland. - Electolyte disturbances. You are taking hydrochlorothiazide which can cause low potassium. - Smoking. - Drinking alcohol. - Drinking too much caffeinated beverages. - Being tired and not getting enough sleep. - Stress.   If you have not had any blood tests for thyroid problems and electrolyte disturbances, i would recommend that you have them. i also recommend that you have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart).

    "content": "Thank you, Dr. Mokhtar, for your reply.  I really appreciate the detailed analysis!  The sudden change I am concerned about is the blood pressure increase.  I had been checking it nearly daily because I was checking my husband's, and it had always been well below 140/90.   The PA I saw when this started was concerned about the sudden increase and wanted to find out why, but this new doctor didn't seem concerned and said it wasn't uncommon. I hope she is right.  All the other causes you mention have checked out ok, except for stress and lack of sleep.  Maybe that's the major problem. I did have similar palpitations but no BP problems 5 years ago when I was anemic, but once that was solved the problem went away.    The doctor added HCT back with the Cardizem this week, so hopefully that will help get the BP down,  I can quit being so stressed out, get my cholesterol down,  and all will be well again.  Thanks again for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "To make a long story short. I have Familial Hypercholesterolemia and was diagnosed in '95 and at that time was well into the 400's on my lipid panel. I have been on low Sat fat/Cholesterol diet since that time. I was taking Lipitor for about six months, until I lost my insurance. I also have jogged/run regularly up until about a year ago, when I started experiencing some uncomfortable symptoms when I would get my heart rate that high. I thought I was doing all I could to lower my cholesterol so I really didn't worry much about it.   As of 3/2005 my lipid test results as follows; Triglycerides 209mg Total Cholesterol 394 HDL 36mg LDL 316mg  My Primary Dr. has referred me to a Cardiologist for stress test etc. He placed me on a restricted diet. Chol: under 50 mg per day, Sat. Fat: under 5 mg per day, which I am following faithfully. He has also requested I not run/jog and I'm to limit any walking which may raise my heart rate, until the Cardiologist sees me this Friday. I am currently taking 40mg Lipitor daily.  I'm scared and I believe I am frightening myself. These past few weeks since my last visit to my PF, I have suffered numerous dizzy spells where all the color drains from my face, my hands sweat and I feel like I'm going to pass out and I have to sit down quickly. I also feel tightness in my chest. I often wake up gasping for air in the middle of the night. Am I simply in panic mode because of my recent test results and Dr.'s concern?   Also, what can I expect from a stress test/ Cardiologist visit? Should I fast? The nurse who scheduled the appointment didn't give me any information on this. Thank you in advance for any assistance you can give me. Sorry this was so long.\n\n",

I think you should be fasting may be 4 hours before the test , so you won't get nauseous....you won't run for a mile don't worry..!!   those dizzy spells you get might be from uncontrolled blood pressure while tightness of chest and gasping for air in the middle of the night  this sounds like something called cardiac dyspnea/asthma...due to lung congestion and low cardiac output.   These are just hypothesis... that cannot be answered except after visiting your cardiologist and having all the appropriate investigatoins . If they find that the stress test is abnormal , they might want to do an echocardiography to check for your heart's valves and wall status and your heart's contraction power.   a simple Chest X-ray would be useful as well.

    "content": "Dear Dr. Mokhtar,             Quick background. I started having dizziness back in October last year and was diagnosed with  labyrnthitis, then BPPV. After a number of months, and failed manuevers to correct it, I started noticing muscle weakness and some spasms at night. I was then sent for an MRI and referred to a neurologist. The MRI was fine, as was the eeg and baer. When the neuro examined me, he noticed tachycardia and ordered a slew of blood tests, all of which came back just fine. Went back to my PCP on Monday, a few weeks after the blood tests came back, and he did a quick EKG which showed the tachycardia was still present.  Tomorrow, Thursday, he wants me to come back in  to get the Holter Monitor. My question is this: If that test comes back \"normal\" too,  is it reasonable to stop having tests? I ask only because I guess there are probably a whole lot more of them possible. How much damage can a rapid heart rate do?  One nurse, at the ENT's, took my pulse and it was 120 and she let out a little squeak LOL Let's say the Holter Monitor shows it is not always rapid, but only sometimes, would I be able to avoid medication? I do not smoke, I do not drink, I do not drink coffee, tea or cola. I exercise moderately 3 times a wekk. My mother has a rapid heart rate and is on medication.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: How many tests",
    "content": "Dear Leamea,  i assume that you had your holter monitor by now.  Tachycardia is defined as a heart rate above 100/minute.  Tachycardia, if it was sinus, i.e. originating normally from where it should arise from, has so many causes and to treat it, its cause should be found. Causes include anxiety, exercise, physical unfitness, lack of sleep, caffeine, alcohol, smoking, dehydration. Diseases that can cause tachycardia include overactive thyroid gland, low blood count (anemia), electrolytes disturbances, fever, heart failure, coronary disease, low oxygen in the blood amongst others.  i am not sure what kind of blood tests you had, but the usual ones are thyroid blood tests complete blood count and electrolytes.  In the doctor's office, if you just came in and your pulse was taken then, it might be the cause of the tachycardia or if you were anxious, your pulse would be high as well.    The benefit of the holter monitor is that it would show how your pulse varies all over the 24 hours period (or more if needed) especially during sleep, and not just a spot measurement like the one that you had at the doctor's office. If you have tachycardia even during sleep, i would recommend that you have the thyroid blood tests repeated, may be try a small dose tranquilizer and see if it makes a difference. If it is still there, i would recommend that you be seen by a cardiologist (and potentially and electrophyiologist who is a cardiologist specialized in arrhythmias) to be evaluated as there are arrhythmias that look exactly like sinus tachycardia but are not sinus tachycardia. You might be given a medication that will control your heart rate.  One test that i think should be done is an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) if your doctor thinks it is indicated. Echo shows the heart, the size of its chambers, its valves and its function.  Sinus tachycardia is not easy to treat especially if a cause is not found. If you had as many tests and they were all negative, i think it is not a bad idea to watch it for a while.  If a patient have tachycardia for a long period of time, rarely, this patient can develop what is known as cardiomyopathy (dilatation of the heart and decreased heart function) induced tachycardia, but this is very rare like i said.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sheri,  Pothrombin g20210a mutation is a mutation in the gene regulating the formation of prothrombin causing the patient to become hypercoagulable (more prone to blood clots).  Cardiolipin antibodies increase mean that you might have a syndrome called antiphospholipid syndrome where there is an increase in clotting as well.  Low Antithrombin iii is of clinical significance is that it causes as well increase tendency to blood clotting.  i think that you better see a hematologist (blood diseases specialist) about these results for a better interpretation and the possibility that you might be started on long term anticoagulation.

But last week I had different pains and had been under a great deal of stress and my blood pressure has be very high, so instead of going to the ER went to my Dr. and I was sent to the hospital by Ambulance. Once again all my test came back fine. i don't know what to do in the future I feel like if I every have chest pain don't do anything but what  if that was the one time it was a heart attack. What should I do?\n\n",

You have 2 major risk factors for coronary disease. i am not sure about the characteristics of your chest pain. Have you ever had a stress test?  My recommendation is that every time you have chest pain, you have to be evaluated by a health care professional. i also recommend that you have a stress test to rule out coronary disease as a possible cause for chest pain if you had not had one.  Mitral valve prolapse can cause atypical chest pains and if it turns out that it is the cause of the chest pain, there are medications of the beta blockers group that you can use (and they ca take care of the high blood pressure as well.

    "content": "OK, first thing \u2013 relax.    My first advice is just that ... relax and think about this logically.  Why would you be hypertensive (have high blood pressure), look at the risk factors, hereditary, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, caffeine, stress, diabetes, etc.  You\u2019re only 19, that\u2019s a definite plus.    Second, it\u2019s pretty common for someone to take their BP one day and get say 120/80, then take it another day and get 130/90 \u2013 and then panic.  Your BP fluctuates!  It can vary depending on your activity level, position, if you just had a coffee or cigarette, stress level (see \u2018white coat syndrome\u2019), etc.  It\u2019s normal for it to go up and down, if it\u2019s exactly the same twice in a row, it\u2019s pretty a much a coincidence (obviously within limits!).   You\u2019re considered as being possibly hypertensive if your systolic (the top number) is above 140 and your diastolic (the bottom number) is above 90 (those numbers can vary a bit depending on the source).    As for the chest pains \u2013 it\u2019s not unheard of for someone your age to have a heart attack (or some other heart condition) but the odds are definitely in your favor of the pains being something else.    What exactly did you mean when you said you\u2019re having more \u201cfun\u201d than you ever have had so do not want to alter your lifestyle?  Seriously, maybe there\u2019s an answer there somewhere.     I recommend that you go see your GP; it\u2019s better if you have a \u2018problem\u2019 to know about it, then it can be treated and/or monitored, than to have a problem and not know about it!    Ignorance, denial, and indifference are not words that should be used to describe anyone\u2019s attitude about their health.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Madison,  To be diagnosed with high blood pressure, you have to have blood pressure readings equal to or higher than the normal limits (140/90) on three different occasions (three different days) during the same week.  It is very rare but not unheared of to have high blood pressure at such a young age,  but there is no need to panic as most of the time, it is just a random high reading that does not necessarily reflect the blood pressure all over the 24 hours.

    "title": "Pains in my chest and head",
    "content": "I am a 38 year old male living in the United Kingdom and recently nearly 2 weeks ago was went to the accident and emergency here in the UK with pains in my chest and head. After numerous blood tests they said that i may have a possible blood clot and so they did more tests over the next few days to rule it in or out which the VQ test came back as Low Probability, while i was having the VQ test i was getting bad chest pains again and they did an ECG at the Nuclear Department which the staff and the doctor said something about the ECG showing AF which i don't understand what AF means. The doctor at the time said to me he could not let me go anyway as my heart rate was high. Last year i was also in hospital with bleeding stomach ulcers, and whilst in started to get chest pains and my heart rate reached 190+ at times but they said to me it was a problem with low potassium and gave me some potassium drinks. Now over the past 10 or more years on different occasions i have ended up at the accident and emergency for chest pains but the only thing they always said is that i had tachycardia which is a fast heart rate i think and let me go each time. When i was released this time from hospital they gave me two medications named Cardicor and ramipril and never explained to me what the medication is for. The reason i am writing is that when i am admitted they never seem to get to the bottom of the problem and now this evening i am feeling a tightness and heavy in my chest again and pain up the right side of my neck but i am hesitant to go to the accident and emergency again as i feel they will just release me after a while with no real answers. Is there anyway you can put me in contact with someone in the UK or give me some information as i am at a loss on what to do next.  This is an update to the above text which i wrote a few days ago until i found somewhere like your website that i could ask for some advice. I was admitted to hospital again yesterday morning but released the same day later that night after being taken ill at the outpatient department that i was attending for a routine appointment for another condition not connected to all this what as been happening to me lately. I had not felt well since i was first released from hospital the first time which is explained above. I will outline what happened to me yesterday Thursday 17th March. It was around 10:30 am and i started to get severe chest pains and also felt terribly sickly and my heart was pounding and short of breath. The staff at the outpatient clinic phoned for an ambulance. When the paramedics arrived they first of all gave me oxygen as i could not get my breath and they also gave me a squirt of a spray under my tongue which they said would help with the pain until we reached hospital. The paramedics also did an ECG and the only thing i could hear them talking about it was that the ECG came back with a result of a VT which i tried to look up on the Internet but could not find much information on what that means. Anyway when i arrived at the Hospital assessment area they did numerous blood tests again and another ECG.A little later that afternoon the Doctor came back to me and wanted to do another chest Xray and also another VQ scan as again one of the blood test came back as positive for a chance of a blood clot which i already had both those test 2 weeks ago. The results of the VQ scan again came back again as low risk but the staff in the Nuclear department were very surprised they let me out of hospital the first time and thought i was still in hospital and they sent me for another follow up scan.  The Doctor in the Nuclear department also told the staff i think he would be better off with a different kind of scan and the Staff Nurse and other staff were urging him to put a request in for it but then he said no to them because it was another doctor that arranged these same test again that i already had. I am not sure what the name of the test he said to them would be better as i had already had this one only 2 weeks earlier as i was still getting some chest pain and my heart pounding as they were doing the test again. They also squirted a spray again under my tongue during me having the VQ test again as i could not keep still with the pain in my chest whist breathing trough the mask.  Anyway a few hours later that evening the Doctor came back saying that the VQ test again came back as Low Probability of a PE. Now i was still feeling very sickly but the pain in my chest had lessoned somewhat, just leaving the sensation i have been getting now for over two weeks since i was first admitted which is a very heavy feeling over my chest like a weight on my chest. He said that i should just take the medicine i was given before which was Cardicor for my heart rate and ramipril for my very high blood pressure which he said was unusual for someone my age. He also said he thought the pains were muscular which i very much doubt, but he is the doctor and who am i to argue that point over to him. So here i am again at home and the sickness feeling and heaviness is still there and i have hardly eaten anything since coming out as soon as i have eaten a bit the nausea sickness feeling seems top get worse, the only pain in my chest i have been getting since i was out is every now and again i get a sharp pain in center of my chest which then takes my breath for a few moments and my heart pounding on and off all day and i keep burping every now and again.  I just don't know what to do next as if i feel the same again..I will feel such a fool to go to the emergency department or call for an ambulance as i feel nothing will be done and this will just go on and on with no end in sight.  Sorry for explaining this how i have but i just don't know who to turn to next.  Thanks for listening  Best Wishes Robert\n\n",

    "content": "I will tell you that even if you need to leave the UK to find a good Cardiologist, you need to do this. Your life is in danger if everything you are saying is correct. You are in danger of a possible HEART ATTACK, STROKE and/or DEATH and you are way to young to have a heart in this condition. This is a personal question, are you an intravenous drug user? Something has beat your heart up for it to be acting this way. It may have been injured or attacked by a virus or possibly you inherited this but a Cardiologist can help you out, I'm talking NOW, you don't have time to waste, you are be in extreme danger as we speak. You can blow a blood clot and die or stroke at any moment, especially when your heart starts fluttering. Did they tell you to take an aspirin a day or anything like that?  My educated guess would be that you are having atrial fibrillation causing possible clots to form and ventricular flutters  but are they being cardioverted by electricity? You may need a pacemaker put in place. When you complain of chest pain they spray nitroglyerine under your tongue to dialate the cardiac vessels so the heart can breath and they should put you on oxygen at this time also.   AF - Atrial fibrillation - In it the heart's two small upper chambers (the atria) quiver instead of beating effectively. Blood isn't pumped completely out of them, so it may pool and clot in the bottom of each chamber. If a piece of a blood clot in the atria leaves the heart and becomes lodged in an artery in the brain, a stroke results. VF - ventricular flutter is a ventricular rate of 150-300 bpm and requires defibrillation or cardioversion (where they shock you) usually to get out of it.  This link is the the American Heart Association in the USA but it can explain AF, VF and other cardiac stuff, look around on their websites. Maybe you could even contact someone for a good Cardiologist reference. Just PLEASE don't drop this, I feel very insecure with your treatments as you have explained it.   http://www.americanheart.org  and go to warning signs\n\n",

    "content": "Hello AZ Paramedic  Thank you so much for the information in your reply. To answer your questions about drugs..I have never taken any form of drug in my life and the only thing i can think of is that a lot of my relatives and close family have had heart problems. My uncle had an heart attack but had bypass to put that right, my grandmother and grandfather died of heart related problems. MY mother has a heart murmur from birth and high blood pressure. I think the link to my problem how i am at the moment must be inherited. I forgot to mention that while i was  on the assessment ward I had some kind of attack which i am not sure what it was....I went very hot and sweaty all of a sudden and very sickly but just before that happened i had a big pain in my chest and then it left me short of breath and gasping again, i did notice on the machine that was attached to my finger which i glanced at during having this problem was my oxygen was 72 , not sure what that means and my heart rate i kept seeing it go from 130 to 240 then down to 80 then up to over 250 all over the place. I  called over for a nurse who came to me and said she would get the Doctor but he never came as i think he must of been with another patient and only came over after that episode had died down and to tell me he needed to do a VQ test again because a blood result again like 2 weeks before came back positive that there was a chance of a blood clot, But as i said in my other post again the result came back low probability. I really wished that the other Doctor at the Nuclear scanning department would of insisted on that other test he said would of been better because i had only had the VQ  test 2 weeks earlier and with him working in that area i thought maybe he mentioned this other test because he felt a better result would come of it to at least find out what is going on with me.  When i was sent in the first time just over 2 weeks ago, it was head pain very sharp that i had from early morning and lasted all day and into the early hours of the next day, The following day i started with chest pains and the heaviness , weight feeling over my chest and so went to the emergency department. The sharp pains i still get in my head..not like a headache but when they come are just sharp pains and also i get a very heavy feeling in my head similar to what i get in my chest, like a weight is pressing down.  Like i said in my other post I just wished they could of got to the bottom of what is wrong so at least i know it can be treated and to stop all these symptoms i have been getting for over two weeks now.  I forgot to mention that they also  had been giving me Heparin  injections whilst i was in hospital the first time in my stomach and then again this Thursday last week they also gave me a injection earlier that afternoon of it, but then released me as i explained.  If my VQ scan came back twice of the low probability of a blood clot but the blood test they do to see if there is a chance of a blood clot comes back positive does this mean i have no blood clots and the problem is related just to my heart. The reason i can't understand it is why has the blood test they did each time i was admitted come back that they needed to do a VQ scan because the blood test was positive?  Thank you for your advice and the link you gave me, it has helped me a lot, and  I will take a look on that website to see if i can find a cardiologist that will at least get me sorted on medication or something to stop me feeling how i am. If there was one thing i wish that could just go it would be the heaviness over my chest which is so hard to describe what it feels like and the pounding sensation of my heart....and also the sickness which i am not sure is related to al this or not, but i have had this sickly feeling since Thursday and it's not gone yet.  Best Wishes Robert\n\n",

I feel that you are in a life threatening emergency here and I can't stress it enough to find a Cardiologist and see them as soon as possible. Do you have one around you? The weight you feel in your chest is your heart having a hard time pumping and \"breathing\".

I would not know really how to get the copies of the ECG that they took, but they must have them in my hospital records. The heparin i was pleased in one way that they gave me an injection because i was thinking that at least it will help if i have got a clot even thought those two VQ scans came back low probability..but i am not on the injections at home they only gave me them till they released me from hospital again. Thank you for going to so much trouble to help me and try to find a cardiologist to contact me.  If he needs my phone number or email just tell me how i can give them to him, by email or something. The only other symptoms i have at the moment is dizziness and also sometimes a dull ache up my neck.  Robert\n\n",

The R wave is the first tallest upward (positive) deflection on your ECG reading when the heart starts it's beat.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Thank you for thinking about me and your concern. Because i feel so poorly and the heaviness, sickness  and chest pains i keep getting are not bating off, i am thinking of getting to the emergency hospital again in the morning if things are no better or if they get worse will go tonight instead of waiting for a referral to a cardiologist to come through. I just wished this heavy weight feeling would go. The only thing that is putting me off doing this again is i feel such a fool because this will be 3 times now in just over two weeks i have been admitted, but  i just can't stand feeling how i am each time i come out without the problem being sorted for me. The other reason is that i feel they will just do all the same blood work again and it will come back fine except again for the clotting one which i am not sure what it is called but it seems to come back positive each time, then i just hope it wont be another repeat of the VQ scan as i have already had 2 in 2 weeks.  You see when your admitted i don't think it will be cardiologist who will be there, maybe just  a Doctor who works in all areas. Have you any advice if it seems to be a repeat again of what  test i need to tell if they have done or can it only be sorted with tests a cardiologist can ask for. Another thing i can't understand is if all my blood work is coming back okay for the test they are doing, could they be missing certain tests. The other thing is can i still have clots even if the VQ scan keeps coming back low probability. Thank you and for your kindness and help.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Robert,  To determine whether or not chest pain is caused by coronary disease, major risk factors for coronary disease and the characteristics of the chest pain (as compared to that caused by coronary disease) are looked at and then the probability that the chest pain is due to coronary disease is then determined.  You have one major risk factor for coronary disease and that is being a male. Otherwise you don't have any. Your chest pain is atypical. The probability that your chest pain be due to coronary disease is low.  The chest pain that you are getting is the way many people describe the palpitation feelings that they have, every time that you have palpitation or fast heart beat, you feel this pressure or pain. So, what you are feeling is not actual pain, it is the feeling of your heart beating fast (and may be even contracting stronger) and this gives this uncomfortable feeling in the chest that you describe as pain.  Atrial fibrillation (af) is a condition in which the heart, instead of beating in a regular fashion, starts beating in an irregular fashion. This irregular rhythm could be fast or slow but the main characteristic is the irregularity of the rhythm. Atrial fibrillation has many reasons including but not limited to high blood pressure, hyperactive thyroid gland, electrolyte imbalance, heart problems such as valvular heart disease and lung problems such as developing pulmonary embolism or having chronic lung disease such as emphysema. In some instances, a cause is not found and in this case, atrial fibrillation is called lone atrial fibrillation.  Ventricular tachycardia (vt) is a condition in which the electrical impulses of the heart abnormally originate from the ventriles which are the 2 chambers that pump blood into the body (left) and the lungs (right) instead of originating from the atria which are the 2 chambers that receive blood from the body (right) and from the lungs (left). Ventricular tachycardia (in addition to the causes that are mentioned above as causes for atrial fibrillation) usually points to a heart problem. This heart problem can sometimes be a serious one.  i never heard of the term ff in ecg.   i am not sure why they keep doing vq scans everytime you go in to be checked and i am not sure what is the blood test that came back positive saying there might be a bloot clot (which makes them do a vq scan everytime). i think that the other test that the nuclear medicine doctor was referring to was spiral ct scan with contrast. This is a good test for detection of big central pulmonary emboli. The gold standard test is pulmonary angiography and may be this the test that the doctor was referring to but this test has some side effects. Low probability means that the probability that you have a blood clot when you have a low probability scan is very low. If you don't have any risk factor for pulmonary emboli and you have little or no symptoms to suggest the presence of a pulmonary embolus, then most probably, you don't have a pulmonary embolus.  It sounds that you have been having these episodes quite often and as Web-medic suggested, it is imperative that you be seen and evaluated by  a cardiologist and if possible a cardiologist specialized in heart arrhythmias (called an electrophysiologist).  There is no need to feel stupid every time you think of going to emergency when you have these symptoms. Please, go. You are not stupid, you are a person whose needs have not been met and you need to be treated and that is why you have to go every time till you are treated.  i am not sure how the health system works in the United Kingdom, but do you have a primary care physician to whom you can go to for checkups and if anything wrong arises? If yes, i think you should talk to him about being referred to a cardiologist instead of waiting to be referred from the emergency department.  If not already done, i would suggest having blood tests for a complete blood count, electrolytes including calcium, magnesium and phosphorus, thyroid blood tests, echocardiograpy (ultrasound of the heart), Holter monitor (24 hours heart monitor) that will record your heart rhythm and rate over 24 hours and this is going to help to determine what kind of rhythm disturbance youb have.   Please, keep us updated on how everything turns out.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "My husband's father and oldest brother both had heart-attacks before the age of 40. His next oldest brother (my husband is 36, the youngest of six children) has been diagnosed with angina.  Yesterday my husband experienced chest pain and pressure with fatigue and dizzyness. Took him to the emergency room and he was admitted to the hospital overnight for observation. EKG's were normal; blood tests throughout the evening showed that his enzymes were also normal.  The cardiologist wanted my husband to have an angiogram, but my husband is alergic to shellfish. We've been told that he can't have the test, or that if he did it would be extremely risky. Surely there is a synthetic alternative to the squid-ink derived dyes used in an angiogram? Surely there must be many, many people with seafood alergies.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Shellfish alergy preclude an angiogram?",
    "content": "Dear Monkey,  Patients who are allegic to shellfish do have an increased propensity to reaction caused by the dye but it is no greater than patients who are allergic to peanuts, eggs, or strawberries.  There are medications that can be given within the previous 12-24 hours period to patients with food allergies such as shellfish or allergy to the dye itself. These medications will recude the incidence of such allergic reactions but it does not reduce the risk to zero. These are steroids and antihistamines.  The risk has to be weighed against the benefit and then a decision made, whether or not go ahead and perform the angiogram.  If your cardiologist does not feel comfortable performing this, most probably he thinks that the risks of performing the angiogram with your husband's history of chest pain and that of allergy, outweighs the benefits.  Your husband is a male who has a very strong positive family history of coronary disease and these are two major risk factors for coronary disease, nothing else was mentioned about other major risk factors for coronary disease he might have such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol. Does he exercise on regular basis? You also did not mention the charateristics of the chest pain your husband had when he was admitted to the hospital.   An angiogram sounds a very reasonable next step with your husband's family history.  There are other dyes that are not iodine based and there are other alternatives to an angiogram such as magnetic resonance imaging (mra) of the coronaries and heart but these are not as good as angiography with an idonine based dye.  A second opinion is always another option.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

Although he is active - he walks 8-10 miles a week -  he is admittedly overweight at 72\" tall,  265 lbs.  We just learned that he does have high cholesterol and are taking steps to radically change both our diets to reduce fat and cholesterol and add more fiber.   He described the sensation in his chest and neck as \"pressure\" and \"squeeze\" rather than sharp pain. He was a little short of breath. He did not get sweaty, though he was  warm to the touch and nauseous.   His blood pressure has always been fine, even on the low side, though not abnormally so.  His mother and paternal grandmother both had diabetes.  He is scheduled for a stress-test this week and we hope to learn more.  Once again, thanks so much for your response. Would welcome any additional information you may have to share.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Monkey,  Thank you very much for the update.  Your husband has 2 additional major risk factors which are high cholesterol and smoking (even though he stopped a year ago, the effect of smoking on the risk of developing a heart attack goes down to 50% by 1 year and goes away completely after 15 years).  At his age without his risk factors, most probably, he wouldn't have gotten even a stress test. A stress test is not an unreasonable choice, but i personally think that your husband's case warrants an angiogram like it was first thought but with his history of allergy, let's wait and see what the stress test will show.

    "title": "Moderate diastolic dysfunction, abnormal ECG",
    "content": "I had an ECG and corotid ultrasound because I woke up with blurry vision one day. Opthalmologist found no cuase except a cataract. Blurryness subsided in a couple days.  My PCP called and said the carotids looked normal, and the ECG showed no cause for the vision change. But there was something about the walls of the heart and he wants to look at my blood pressure (which has been high at the doctor's office(145-160/85-100),but not at home (132-140/78-85).  I got the ECG results in the mail yesterday, and it sounds to me like something serious may be wrong. It says:  \"Summary  Overall left ventricular systolic function was normal.  Features were consistent with a pseudonormal left ventricula fillingpatter, with concomitant abnormal relaxation and increased filling pressue. Features were consistent with moderate diastolic dysfunction. There was no echocardiographic evidence for a cardiac source of embolism.\"  Left ventricle: - Left ventricular size was normal.  - Overall left ventricular systolic function was normal. - Left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated in the range of 55-60%. - There was no diagnostic evidence of left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities. - Left ventricular wall thicknes was normal. - Mitral annular TDI was severely abnormal. Doppler interpretation: - There was a normal transmitral flow pattern - The ratio of systolic to diastolic pulmonary vein flow was reduced (diastolic predominant). - features were consistent with a pseudonormal left ventricular fiilling pattern, with concomitant abnormal relaxation and increased filling pressure. - Features were consistent with moderate diastolic dysfunction.\"  Valves all looked normal except for \"trivial mitral valve regurgitation\".  How worried should I be? Is this serious, should I be concerned about having a stroke or heart attack?  Is this a precursor o something more serious?  I don't see my PCP until 3/28 and this has my wife and I worried. I am 50 years old, and have a disk problem in my neck but am otherwise healthy. I do weights 3-4 times a week. Cn you help me understand this?  Thank you for any help you can provide!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear wvrich,  Your echo findings are consistent with diastolic dysfunction which simply means that your heart is not relaxing the way it should. There is no need to worry. It is not a precursor to having a heart attack or a stroke. It can be a manifestation of risk factors causing such ailments. This is not an emergency and you can safely wait till you see your doctor on the 28th of march.  Otherwise, your echocardiogram report does not show any other abnormalities.  Diastolic dysfunction can be caused by aging, high blood pressure, diabetes and coronary disease.  You don't have diabetes, so, i could be aging, having high blood pressure or coronary disease.  i recommend that you discuss having a 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to know how does your blood pressure look around the clolck. Also, you have three risk factors for coronary disease and even though you are not having any chest pain, discuss this with your doctor and if he thinks that it is indicated, i suggest that you have a stress test.

    "content": "Thanks for your reply, Dr. Mokhtar.   I have been monitoring my blood pressure for the last week several times a day.  It averages about 130/78.  My blood pressure has generally been high (145/90 or so)  when I go to see my doctor, but not at home.   If my blood pressure was high when the ECG was done, would that account for the abnormal reading?  Why do they use the term \"severely abnormal\" for the mitral TDI if this is a moderate dysfunction?  If this is not related to \"white coat syndrome\" blood rpessure readings, does it indicate I have another heart problem that will need treatment?  Thanks again for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear wvrich,  Thank you very much for the update.  One reading during the day when you are at home and may be relaxed might not reflect your blood pressure readings over the whole 24 hours period. Discuss having a 24 hours blood pressure monitor with your doctor.  This could be a case of white coat hypertension.  If this diastolic dysfunction is not secondary to hypertension, and you had a stress test to rule out coronary disease (which is a cause for diastolic dysfunction), and you are found not to be a diabetic (have a fasting blood sugar test), then most probably, this is due to aging. It could be due to rare diseases in which some substances infiltrate the heart muscle, but this should have been picked up on the echocardiogram.  One more addition, some patients will have high blood pressure during night time because of sleep apnea. So, if you snore loudly during sleep or was noticed during sleep to stop breathing, i recommend that you have a sleep study.  Diastolic dysfunction usually takes a while to develop, your blood pressure being high only at the time of the echocardiogram will not cause the echocardiogram results to be different.  tdi refers to tissue doppler imaging which describes the tissues themselves. i am not sure why it was described as severely abnormal unless you had mitral annular calcification but it was mentioned that all the valves looked normal.

They put me on fluid pills and potassium which worked fine to begin with but as soon as I stopped taking them, the swelling was back within a couple of days.  I sleep with my feet elevated so it is not so bad in the mornings.  They have run all kinds of tests to see why I keep swelling, but so far they haven't been able to tell me. I also have been told that I may have costochondritis because if I stay bent over, like looking through a box of stuff, and raise up, I have chest pain and shortness of breath, but that doesn't happen unless I stay bent over.  The doctor ordered an echocardiogram last week, and they told me that it said that I have mild mytral regurgitation.  When I got online and started to look up mytral regurgitation, I noticed that ankle and feet swelling is associated with that.  Do I need to worry or just keep taking the fluid pills? Thanks!!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear lstock,  The information that you provided is not complete. i need to know a few more things from the echo results such as how bad is the mitral regurgitation, what is the ejection fraction, what is the pulmonary pressure, are there any other abnormalities?  In very rare instances, protonix might sometimes cause leg edema.  Edema of both legs mean that most probably there is a generalized cause for the edema which could be related to kidney disease, liver disease, heart disease or lung disease.   In some instances if the patient has varicose veins in both lower extremities, this will cause edema also. Local causes that can cause lower limb edema are pelvic tumours or masses compressing the veins of the pelvis and causing back-up in the lower limbs veins leading to edema but these are usually apparent and in most of the cases the edema is on one side only, rarely on both sides.  Edema is caused by increase in the pressure inside the veins of the legs and for any reason such as standing all day or sitting with your legs hanging all day, edema will develop. In this case, the best way to deal with it, even though it is annoying, is to wear a compression stocking first thing in the morning, before you even step out of bed. Diuretics will be needed indefinitely in this case.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

The borderline left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) and the diastolic dysfunction can be caused by high blood pressure. In combination with the mild root dilatation could be caused by aortic stenosis which was not there on the echo.  What was your ejection fraction? The shortness of breath can be caused by the fact that you have diastolic dysfunction.   What was your pulmonary artery pressure on the echo? The combination of your echo picture could be secondary to obstructive sleep apnea. How were you diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia?  What did your cardiologist tell you the diagnosis was? Why does he want a ct of the chest as opposed to repeating the echo?  Where you taking the inhalers before or after this episode and did you feel better after taking them?  Have you taken any medications for weight loss in the past?

    "content": "Dear Lisa,  It is possible to have hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction with normal blood pressure. Usually diastolic dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy occurs with normal blood pressure in the elderly population and you are not that old.  However, other causes include  1. Having a condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and it should be easily diagnosed with echocardiography. 2. Athlete hypertrophy. Some patients develop mild hypertrophy if they exercise on regular basis. This category does not need treatment. Once exercise is stopped, the process is reversed. 3.  Some conditions called infiltrative diseases, where some substances that are not supposed to be there, accumulate in the muscle of the heart itself. These could be diagnosed by echocardiography and they could be diagnosed by other imaging techniques such as ct scans and mri scans.  Other factors that may help in the development of lvh: 1. Obesity. Are you obese? 2. Age. 3. High dietary sodium intake. Try to decrease your salt intake. 4. Diabetes. Were you checked for diabetes?. 5. Insulin resistance.   Pulmonary pressure is called pulmonary pressure on the echo.  The lack of sleep is the cause of your fatigue. i am not an expert in sleep disturbances but these signs are very close to sleep apnea. Sometimes, sleep apnea occurs on some nights only and it is sometimes difficult to diagnose. i am not sure about the effects of primary hypersomnia on the heart, but the echo profile can be one of a sleep apnea patient. i recommend that you talk to your sleep doctor about the echo findings and see whether primary hypersomnia can have such effects on the heart.  Root dillatation for the time being (mild) does not pose any danger and can be safely monitored.  The chest pain could be due to neck problems, if you have not had any neck x-rays or ct scans, i suggest that you do to exclude neck spine problems. And even though your upper gi series were ok, try an over the counter antiacid medication and see whether it helps with the pain.  lvh has to be treated even in the absence of hypertension. You should be taking high blood pressure medications that reverse this process. Most probably, you will have to take them in small doses, unless this is due to athlete hypertrophy (no need for treatment as mentioned earlier).

    "content": "Dear lsmith1,  The diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy relies on dilatation of the left ventricle and systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (low ejection fraction).  An ejection fraction of 53% is considered by many to be on the low normal (but normal) and you did not have a dilated left ventricle on the echo, so i am not sure that peripartum cardiomyopathy is the correct diagnosis. You have quite a bit of pvcs and bigeminy.  Arrhythmias can be caused by: 1. Mitral valve prolapse. Your echo did not show that. 2. Abnormality in the electrolytes levels in the blood. i recommend that you have a blood test to check for your electrolytes level. 3. Thyroid gland problem. i recommend that you have a blood test to check for your thyroid gland function. 4. Drinking caffeinated beverages. If you are drinking then cut down on the caffeine as much as you can. 4. Smoking. i hope you are not. 5. Drinking. i hope you are not. 6. Not getting enough sleep. i know with a 3.5 months old, you are probably not getting enough sleep, but try as much as you can to get some rest. 7. Coronary disease. Low probability in your case.  Shortness of breath can be caused by many causes starting from being physically unfit and ending with heart failure.   A beta blocker is a medication that will control the arrhythmias but this is just symptomatic treatment, the reason behind the arrhythmias has to be sought.

My doctor already put me on a beta blocker but still does not know what is wrong with me.  I have one doctor telling me it is anxiety and another telling me it is cardiomyopathy.

    "content": "Dear lsmith1,  Thank you very much for the update.  Please, stop smoking and drinking, these simple measures help lots of patients get rid of their symptoms.  In my personal opinion, from what your echo shows, you don't have cardiomyopathy (at least not peripartum).   To be evaluated for cardiomyopathy, and if your doctor has not referred you to a cardiologist, i would recommend that you be referred to a cardiologist.  Anxiety can sometimes cause palpitations but i don't thin it causes pvcs unless you have severe stress with high levels of adrenaline.  Have the beta blockers helped your symptoms?  How about your other blood work, if you have anemia (low hemoglobin count), this can cause shortness of breath as well.

Obviously it is not a heart attack or I would be dead already but aren't beta blockers suppose to help angia?  Maybe it is muscular from holding my child all the time.  Today my big toes feel numb don't know what that is but it feels pretty weird.  My doctors think that 53% is low EF for someone my age and I have a cardiologist consultation tomorrow morning.

    "content": "I am wondering if I could get advice on this :  I am a male and I just turned 21.  I got chest pain since about a year on the left side of the chest, around the heart area.   I went to the hospital 2 times for this, both time they told me it could only be some normal inflammation, so they put me on pills boht times, but it did no diffirence.  The pain is constant, it is like it wants to stick out of my chest, it feels sore, when i move my arms it feels like it needs to stretch like an elastic or something in the kind. Sometimes I will have heart pain and my heart rate will beat faster when it will occur.   The chest also has a pretty bad bumb (It sticks out) and you can notice easly if I have no t shirt on, and a little if i wear oine, but it is still noticable.  I also have hard times swallowing sometimes, but not often. (When it hurts)  Right now it is hurting and burning, but sometimes it gets pretty bad, like a very sharp pain.  Any Idea what this could be?  Thanks, Stephan\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Stephan,  To determine whether or not chest pain is caused by coronary disease, risk factors for coronary disease and chest pain characteristics are looked at and then the probability of this pain being due to coronary disease is determined.  Your risk factors include you being a male. Your chest pain characteristics sound atypical, so the probabililty of this chest pain being due to coronary disease is very low.  At such a young age, there is a common condition known as mitral valve prolpase that is common and known to cause atypical chest pain and palpitations in the otherwise healthy young people. It is diagnosed by an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) and it just needs to be watched.   Other causes include inflammation of the chest wall and you are getting the medication for it and it is not helping. Neck problems, so i recommend that you have a neck x-ray/ct scan to exclude such problems. Acid reflux disease is well known to cause chest pain, so i would advise you to try over the counter anti-acids to see whether this is going to help espeically with the burning sensation that you have and the history of difficulty in swallowing.  With your history of depression, these pains could be secondary to recurring depression or anxiety, please, talk to your psychiatrist about these symptoms.

    "content": "Dear Vonda,  You have very mild pulmonary hypertension. For now, i don't think you should be worrying. This being said, however, i would like to add that a reason for this pulmonary hypertension has to be looked for.  In the obese population, developing pulmonary hypertension without an obvious cause usually points to the presence of obstructive sleep apnea. So, i would recommend that you have a sleep study.  Can having chest pain be associated with increase in the pulmonary pressures? The answer is yes. In cases of acute pulmonary embolism (blood clots to the lungs). But in your case it is a long shot because if this was the case, you would have been very sick and need to be admitted to the hospital. Can it happen in your case, it could, in case you were having very small repeated showers of pulmonary embolization to your lungs.   Chest pain has many causes and any person who has chest pain has to be evaluated by a health care professional. Please, schedule an appointment to be see by your doctor or if over the week end the pain intensifies, i would recommend that you visit the emergency department.

I went to the doctor and did have a ultrasound exam of the heart, im sure or think they said it wall clear or things look good. They said since i have done practically every test even having a 24 haulter i should be fine. They told me i would be running 1 or 2 final exams, A stress test exam and something else with ym lungs on a trend mill also. The doctor said that what this could probally be is just muscle tension around the heart or something of the sort but nothing to worry about. The  thing is i am still getting it its like sometimes when i breathe in i might feel a pain there or a sort of sharp pain hard to describe or sometimes i just might feel paine there out of no where. Again i am 15 years old bout 5 to 7 pounds overweight really 5,5 never had any health conditions of any sort and thats about it. Also  i think i have kind of experienced sort of a heart burn sensation sometimes after eating greasy foods. I hope i am not turning into a hipochondriac or how ever you might spell it.    I would just like to be healthy the same way i had been before about a year ago. O and no , no one in my family has past record of heart diesease or heart related problems.\n\n",

I also experience shortness of breath and this is present even without the pain.  These pains typically last less than 10-15 seconds each but they will reoccur throughout the day.    Back in Sept, I had a chest x-ray, blood work, ECG, ECHO and stress test with nuclear imaging.  All the results came back normal.  My problem is that the symptoms have not gone away and I'm concerned that something was missed.  Would all these tests be definitive in diagnosing a heart problem?  Could blockages in arteries still exist as I've read that these tests are not as accurate in young females?    Since 6 months have passed, should any of them be repeated since my symptoms still exist.  I am very concerned and would appreciate some advice.    Laura\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Laura,  To determine whether or not chest pain is caused by coronary disease, the risk factors for coronary disease in the patient complaining of chest pain are assessed and the characteristics of the chest pain are looked at and the probability of this pain being caused by coronary disease is then determined. If the patient has many risk factors for coronary disease (these are hypertension, diabetes, smoking, drinking, family history, advanced age, male gender and hypercholesterolemia) and the characteristics of the pain are typical as compared to characteristics of the pain caused by coronary disease, the probability of the pain being caused by coronary disease is high and such patients don't even go through stress test but they are directed to coronary angiography. If the patient does not have any risk factors and the pain is atypical, the probability is low and such patients are not even subjected to stress tests. If the patient has one or two risk factors and the chest pain has some of the typical features, these are the patients that are subjected to stress test because the probability of this pain being due to coronary disease could not be determined.  In your case, you did not mention whether or not you have any of the risk factors for coronary disease and from your description, it sounds that the pain that you have been suffering from is atypical as compared to that of coronary disease. This being said, however, females of the child bearing age are protected against coronary disease unless they have diseases that are considered major risk factors for coronary disease such as hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol for a long time enough to affect their coronaries (because these diseases take quite a while to affect all the blood vessels in the body including the coronaries).   So, to begin with, you are a female of the child bearing age and unless you have been hypertensive, diabetic or have high cholesterol for the last 10-15 years, you are protected against coronary disease, in addition, your chest pain is atypical, so the probability of your chest pain being secondary to coronary disease is low. On top, you had a stress test (if it was an exercise stress test and you kept exercising till your heart rate reached its goal without you having chest pain, this is a very good sign that you don't have coronary disease) with nuclear imaging (which increases the sensitivity and specificity of a regular stress test quite a bit) and it was negative. So, i am confident that the chest pain that you have been having is not caused by coronary disease. Also, echocardiograms show changes in the way the heart muscle contracts if the patient has coronary disease and yours was negative as well.  If after six months, you are still having the same chest pain, and if this chest pain was not secondary to coronary disease to begin with, then, i would say that still this pain is not seconadry to coronary disease after 6 months.  If you are still really worried about this being caused by coronary disease, then the ultimate test is a coronary angiogram where a dye is injected into your coronary arteries and the arteries is visualized with x-rays real time. Of course, this procedure is not without cmplications and i am not sure whether or not a cardiologist would be willing to perform it in your case because of low probability and the negative stress test that you had.

    "content": "Thank you for your reply, Doctor.  In response to your question about my risk factors.  There is no family history of coronary artery disease.  My blood pressure is normal as is my cholestrol level.  I am a non-smoke and not diabetic although my grandmother was but she lived to be 90.  I'm 5 feet tall and weigh 105 pounds so I'm not overweight although I'm afraid I'm not very active.    My big concern is that my chest pains persist and my shortness of breath is also constant sometimes with little exertion.  This causes me much anxiety.    I was able to complete the stress test (with thallium) to my maximum heart rate but am still concerned that a blockage might be present as my symptoms have not disappated.  At the time of the test, the cardiologist was confident that my pains were not related to my heart but that was 5 months ago.  With them persisting, I'm not so sure.  How accurate is the stress test with thallium at ruling out blockages in someone with my medical history?  I just don't know what other tests I could ask for extra reassurance without going the route of an angiogram as I'm sure the doctor will discourage.  Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated, Laura\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Laura,  Thank you very much for the update.  If you reach your maximum predicted heart rate on the treadmill and you did not get any chest pain and the thallium was negative, this is a very good indicator that you don't have any blockages and that actually you have a very good coronary reserve and that you don't have to worry one bit.  Since this is the same chest pain (no change in the characteristics of the chest pain) and you are the same peron with no change in risk factors, the probability of this being due to coronary disease is still the same (even after 6 months), low.   The gold standard to diagnose coronary diseases is coronary angiography. So, if you want to be 100% sure, the way to go is coronary angio but still i am not sure that many cardiologists will go for it.

    "content": "In 2003, I had prostrate cancer with radiation and hormone treatment. I only had to take 4 hormone shots. I have not had any more problems with my prostrate.  In August 2004, I had a heart attack and a quadruple bypass. A echocardiogram showed that all 4 valves have mild regurgetation.  I am miserable. I feel cold most of the time. I feel like I'm freezing or I am in a deep freeze. I have the most excuricating pain all over my whole body. If the room temperture gets a little too warm, I break out into a sweat. This is really a heavy sweat and I will have to change my T-shirt. It's almost like I am having a hot flash. My whole head feels like it is on fire.This happens 2 - 3 times a day. It's almost unbearable.  My doctor seems puzzled. Said It could be some of the medicine I am taking. Suggested I take Ibuprofen. It has not helped. All blood tests came back ok. I have no appetite. I just don't know what to do.   I'm thinking, it could be lack of hormones, a circulation problem, nerve damage, etc. Maybe they didn't hook me back up right after bypass. These problems didn't start until after my bypass.  I am about at my wits ends. Any help or suggestions will be appreciated.  I am a 72 yer old male.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear raineyjd,  i only have some suggestions for you.  i am not sure whether this is possible or not, but have you asked your doctor about this being a late effect of hormonal treatment being stopped. Can men have withdrawal symptoms of famle hormones that late? A question that i think you ought to ask your doctor.  i would certainly check a tsh level and make sure that it is normal and you are not taking a higher dose of synthroid that is causing these symptoms. Synthroid on its own can cause increased sweating.  i think also to check a psa is not a bad idea.  Check your blood sugar as well even though it does not sound like a typical hypoglycemic episode, still low blood sugars can cause profuse sweating.  You don't have to worry about them hooking you up right after bypass because i think you are doing just fine except for this sweating.

    "content": "I am a 17 year old female who attends high school.  I'm average height and weight and I do not engage in any type of drinking, drugs, smoking, etc.  In fact, because of religious views I do not even drink any type of coffee, tea, or caffine.  I feel that although I am not in the best physical shape, I do feel  that I am fairly well in \"shape.\"  I do not feel that my pains have anything to do with stress as I do not lead a very stressful life.       About 2 1/2 years ago I started to experience chest pains.  The pains are exceptionally random.  The usually occur in my upper chest on both or either the left or the right. Sometimes the pain is very sharp, while other times the pain is a dull and extremely uncomfortable pressure.   Sometimes the pain is very light and it does not really bother me, while other times the pain becomes so unbearable that I have had to leave school and come home.  The pains come and go in a completely unpredictable fashion and remain for however long they feel like (or so it seems).  Lately, I have noticed that with the chest pains I have been experiencing tiredness and strange pains in my right arm and/or leg.  The pain in my limbs is usually very uncomfortable but not unbearable.  It radiates down and encompasses the entire limb.  In my hand I have noticed that my fingers feel weak and stiff when I experience this pain. The pain in my arm and leg never comes by itself, it only comes with the chest pains, so I feel certain that they are related.        I have been to the doctor numerous times because of my pains.  I've been in ER as well as just  normal doctor visits.  I have had check-ups as well as EKGs done and blood samples taken.  The doctors have been unable to find anything wrong.  Because the doctors are unable to find anything wrong sometimes my parents express in \"not so many words\" that they think that I may be faking the illness.  I can assure you that my pains are real and that I have no knowledge of their source. Because of the reactions that people have been showing I have lately (for the past several months) kept my pain and discomfort to myself.  I have stopped telling anyone when they occur or how bad I sometimes suffer from them.  I am finding all of this very frustrating and I do not know what to do.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear MormonGurl,  The pain  that you are having is not secondary to coronary disease. First of all because you don't have any risk factors for coronary disease and the charateristics of the pain are atypical as compared to the pain of coronary disease.  Atypical chest pain in a young person usually rises the suspicion of mitral valve prolapse, a very common condition that needs to be watched. i would recommend that you have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) done to rule out this condition.  Regarding the pain that you are suffering from, in addition to possibly being due to mitral valve prolapse, it could be due to neck spine problems, chest wall problems such as costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilages of the ribs), acid reflux disease and anxiety attacks.  What kind of measures have been taken to take care of the pain? Have you had any pain relievers? Have you tried any antiacids? Have you tried any sedatives?  Sometimes, treatment is used as a diagnostic test, so if a patient comes in with a certain symptom and the doctor is not sure what is going on, treatment is given and if the treatment works then the suspicion was true.  So, i would recommend that you try any of the above mentioned treatment modalities after you discuss it with your doctor.

    "title": "Why?",
    "content": "I want to thank you for responding to my questions!  I looked up some of the problems that you mentioned that could possibly be causing my pain and yes, they do look like they could be a possibility.  As far as measures to take care of the pain, the only things that doctors have told me to try things such as an antacid and advil.  They have never given or even mentioned any type of special medicine or prescribed medicine.  I supposed that it was because they didn't find any definite thing wrong with me, so they just told me to take a simple pain reliever when I experience it.    One thing I failed to mention in my previous post was that I have seemed to lately be prone to hyperventilation.  Well, it's only happened twice, but they were within a few months of each other, and fairly recently.  The first time was at a dance where I believe that I merely became overheated and there was a trained nurse there who helped me calm down.  However, the second time was a bit strange.  I was at school, nothing unusual was happening and I just passed out.  When I woke up a few moments later I knew what was going on around me but I felt as though I couldn't move my head, my arms or my legs and they had a severe \"tingling\" sensation like when a limb falls asleep.  I was taken to the hospital, yet again, and had tests done.  They said that it was probably just that I hyperventilated, even though they couldn't tell me why, and that I should be fine.  I returned to school that afternoon and had no more problems with passing out or such since.    Even as I sit here now I am feeling these chest pains.  Today they seem to be more of a burning and pressure sensation with pain extending down into both of my arms and causing my hands to feel weak (which is making my typing this a bit strange feeling). I often feel very tired while I experience these pains.  I understand that these symptoms could possible be pretty serious but I still hesitate to go to a doctor again about them.  As many times as I have been to a doctor and as I have described my pains to them not one of them have ever suggested what you have.  They all seem to believe that it is nothing to really worry about and that advil will solve whatever it is.  I've rather lost my faith in the doctors around here after seeing so many of them to only, time and time again, have them come up with nothing they believe it could be.  Do you believe that there could be a reason that none of the doctors that I have seen have felt that it was serious enough to be concerned about?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear MormonGurl,  Thank you very much for the update.  i would recommend that you have an echocardiogram to rule out mitral valve prolpase. The main symptom of this condition is atypical chest pain and palpitations and It occurs mainly in young females. If you have an echocardiogram and it turns out that you have mitral valve prolpase, you will put your mind to rest and never worry about this chest pain again.  If this hyperventillation is part of the whole symptomatology, then most probably you are suffering from panic attacks.  About your last question, i think if you see the same doctor over and over again with the same symptoms and the doctor does all the tests that are supposed to be done in this situation and nothing comes up, then some doctors will sure think that you have nothing (tests negative over and over) serious to worry about and i think they might have a good excuse to think that way.

    "content": "Hello, my name is Grant and I'm a 30 year old male.  I am having some mild/dull pain on the right side of my chest (towards the center).  It feels deep and its hard to pin point where exactly its coming from.  I worry a lot and I've had several tests done in the the past.  Last April I had a ultrasound/stress test done.  They scanned my heart, I did the actual stress test, then I laid down real quick and they scanned it again.  They said that I didn't have any problems at all.  Everything checked out perfectly.  Well recently I started worrying again.  I had a Cardiac Score (ultrafast CT) test done earlier this week and the tech said that she didn't see anything at all and that I would more then likely get the lowest score (lower being best) possible.    I take 20mg of Zocor daily to help keep my cholestorol down.  It was at 236 back in 2002.  I've had several follow ups since then and it is way down.  I have also recently started taking a Bayer aspirin every day.   I started a workout program three weeks ago, weights and cardio.  I do not feel any pain during or after workouts.    I am also having some numbness in my right hand (middle and ring fingers).  I feel it every once in a while on the bottoms side of my right wrist also.  I've been told I have bone spurs in my neck and I've had to have physical therapy on my neck several times for neck pain.  I'm hoping my numbness is something neck related and not heart related.    So, I have had a stress/ultrasound test done, a cardiac score (ct) and I don't have any pain duirng or after exercise.  I've been told I don't have anything to worry about.  This mild/dull pain in the central/right part of my chest triggers anxiety.  I immediately think the worst, and that it's heart related.  I just want to get a second opinion from someone else.  Should I have any other tests done.  Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.  Sincerely,   Grant\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Grant,  To decide whether or not certain chest pain is due to coronary heart disease, risk factors for conoary disease in the patient suffering from the chest pain and the characteristics of the pain are looked at to see what is the probability of this person having coronary disease.  In your case, your risk factors are merely being a male, i am not sure what a cholesterol of 236 means without telling me what is your good cholesterol (hdl) and your bad cholesterol (ldl). You don't smoke, you don't have any of the major diseases strongly associated with coronary disease namely diabetes and hypertension and most importantly, you don't have a family history of coronary disease because family history of coronary disease means that you have to have a first degree (dad, mom, brother or sister) relative who has a heart attack before the age where coronary disease is to be expected, roughly 50 in men and 60 in women.  Your chest pain is absolutely atypical as compared to that of chest pain typical caused by coronary disease.  So, to start with, your have a very low probability of this pain being due to coronary disease. On top of that, you had a normal exercise stress echo and an ultrafast ct that was normal as well.  i don't think that you have coronary disease. So what is causing this right sided chest pain? It is your neck problem, neck problems can cause chest pains. You can take a look at the forum if you have time and you will find several posts to which i replied that if a person has chest pain that proves not to be due to coronary disease, my personal bias is that a neck x-ray or ct scan even have to be done to rule out neck problems.  Another cause might be reflux disease, you might try taking over the counter aniti-acids and see their effect on the chest pain that you get.

The only thing i have had since iwas little was a Moto Tick, which i don't know if might be part of these pains but well ok, These pains started happening about 1 month ago and for the last 5 months i have had anxiety so my mother and my doctor says. I feel these strange pains in my chest that feel sort of sharp or might be different everytime.They come at random and really last about from 15 seconds to a minute. Maybe i might feel like an after affect for alittle longer later. I have had an EKG done and many other tests for my brain and other things that might be provoking the pains, they all came out clear. I even had a heart monitor straped for 24 hours and that came out all clear too. My mother says that this is just being provoked from stress and says that playing to many impacting video games for a few hours might be stressing me out specially since im a teenager.

    "content": "Dear Relax,  From the description of the pain that you mentioned, it is not consistent with the characteristics of the pain of coronary disease. At your young age, frequent atypical chest pains, especially if associated with palpitations are suspisious for a condition called mitral valve prolapse which is a very common condition that just has to be watched.  i would recommend that you have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) done to rule this condition out. Otherwise, i think that there is nothing to worry about.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "About four months ago I experienced heart block and had to get a pacemaker. I was told that the heart block was the result of calcification of the aortic valve which may have been caused by mitral valve prolapse.       A pacemaker interogation recently showed one incident of ventricular tachycardia in the preceding 2 month period. My doctor prescribed to take a beta blocker to prevent VT and said that I should have a pharmacological stress test.       I told the doctor that I had had no symptoms of VT and believed that the VT was due to sleep apnea made worse by drinking alcohol, and that I can prevent sleep apnea by sleeping on my side as long as I do not drink. I concluded that I don't think I need the beta blocker but he prescribed it anyway.      I told the doctor I would rather have the exercise stress test than the pharacological test as I am not intolerent of exercise. He said that the pacemaker could result in a \"false positive\" on the exercise test.      QUESTION: Is there any real reason I should have the pharmacological stress test rather than the exercise stress test???\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Stress test for pacemaker users",
    "content": "Dear Jack,  A stress test depends mainly on the ekg for interpretation in addition to the patient's symptoms. Whether this stress test is an exercise stress test or a chemical stress test, you will have ekg leads to monitor the ekg changes that might occur if there is ischemia.  The problem in patients who have pacemakers is that the ekg becomes abnormal and does not change and it is not possible to interpret ekg changes during a stress test because they do not occur as the ekg morphology does not change because of the pacemaker.  Ventricular tachycardia is not just a simple arrhythmias, it has to be taken seriously. Having ventricular tachycardia can have lots of reasons including ischemia (which is a serious condition) for which the stress test is being done. It can also mean that the pacemaker is not working as one of the causes of ventricular tachycardia (believe it or not) is bradycardia. So, having a stress test might show that you have coronary disease but it is not an absolute proof that the ventricular tachycardia was secondary to this ischemia. However, if it turns out that you have ischemia, then most probably, this could be the cause behind the ventricular tachycardia.  So, in cases of patients who have pacemakers, usually something besides the ekg is used for interpretation of the test results such as a nuclear study or an echocardiogram. Personally, i think that if a patient can exercise, then the best thing would be to do an exercise test. i am not sure whether your doctor wanted you to have an echocardiogram or not, but if this was the case, then it is better to have a chemical study because, with the patient hyperventillating, it is not easy sometimes to get good echo views of the heart and it is better if the patient has a chemical stress but if a nuclear study is to be done, then both chemical stress and exercise stress can be equally done.    i am not sure what kind of pacemaker you have but most probably you have a pacemaker that accelerates when you exercise but if this is not the case, then i would go with the chemical stress test and not just any pharmacological stress but adenosine stress in particular because you don't have to achieve a certain heart rate to be able complete the study.

    "content": "Dear Ibrehim,  i don't think that weight loss has anything to do with this pain.  To decide whether or not chest pain is due to coronary disease, risk factors for coronary disease of the patient suffering from chest pain and the characteristics of the chest pain itself are looked at. If the patient does not have any risk factors and the characteristics of the pain not typical of pain caused by coronary disease then the possibility that this pain might be due to coronary disease is low and another diagnosis is looked for (another cause for the pain).  If the patient has several risk factors for the pain and the pain has the typical characteristics of the pain caused by coronary disease, the patient is taken to coronary angiography. If the situation is not clear like the patient has one or two risk factors and has some typical features of the pain, the patient is then subjected to a stress test.  In your case, you don't mention having any risk factors for coronary disease and the characteristics of the pain contain some atypical features, so i will assume that this is not coronary disease and that this pain has other reasons.  Chest pain has many other causes besided coronary disease, and you have to be clinically evaluated by a doctor to decide the reason behind this chest pain.  i would recommend that you be seen by your doctor to make sure that there is nothing serious about this pain.

He had an Echo, chest Xray, and blood/urine work done  My blood pressure was high 158/100 and up as high as 210/105.  The blood work came back with everything being okay, he said the chest X-Ray looked fine but the echo showed leakage on the left side.  The doctor put me on 2.5mg per day of Altace and asked me to chart my blood pressure and come back in 4-weeks.  The lowest it's been for the last week is 146/76 and my heart rate is always in the 90's-100's  I woke up a few days ago feeling like I slept on my left shoulder wrong.  My shoulder from the middle of my back, around the top, circling the left part of my chest, and all the way down to my fingers hurts like heck!

The shortness of breath that you were having, most probably was related your blood pressure getting elevated during exercise.  i think your doctor did not do a stress test because you did not have any risk factor for coronary disease (till you were diagnosed with hypertension) and i think that the chest pain that you get was deemed atypical by your doctor, so the probability that this chest pain or shortness of breath being secondary to coronary disease was very small, so there was no need for the stress test.   Even though there is a possibility that this pain that you have been experiencing could be related to the heart as rntdj mentioned, yet the description that you provided for the pain is atypical for pain of coronary disease origin.  It is very wise to call your doctor to tell him about any change or worsening in your symptoms like rntdj advised you to do.   What could this be? It sounds to me like shingles, but let's wait and see what your doctor will say.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "title": "Re: Thyroid related to heart problems",
    "content": "Dear Joy,  Thank you very much for the update.  i am not sure what you mean by thyroid antibody level.  Is your thyroid gland overactive or underactive and i need the exact name of the blood test that you are referring to.  If your thyroid is overactive, thyroid hormones are well known to cause excitation of the heart so patients would get palpitations and arrhythmias.  If your thyroid is overactive, there are medications that you can take that cause slowing of the heart rate and block the effects of thyroid hormones on the heart and other tissues as well. In addition, medications that are directed towards the thyroid gland that would cause a decrease in the hormone production amongst other things.  If you have an underactive thyroid, the treatment is to take thyroid hormones.   There is a condition though where there is inflammation of the thyroid presenting initially with symptoms of over active thyroid gland followed by symptoms of under active thyroid gland if the gland is destructed by the inflammation. So, at the begining you might get anti-thyroid drugs and at the end you might end getting thyroid hormone replacement therapy.  At any rate, thyroid and the cardiovascular system are stongly related and this relationship has been looked at and studied thoroughly.

    "title": "Re: Thyroid related to heart problems",
    "content": "Dear Joy,  Thank you very much for the update.  Thyroid peroxidase auto-antibodies are mainly associated with thyroid inflammation and most commonly auto-immune thyroiditis, where the body forms antibodies that attack its own organs and in this case the thyroid gland causing injury and inflammation of the thyroid gland.  It is better to follow a trend and not actual numbers.  As previously mentioned, inflammation of the thyroid gland may be initially associated with a state of an over active thyroid gland as the inflammed thyroid gland releases the already formed and stored thyroid hormones in them. This stage is usually not treated with immunosuppressant medications such as steroids and the like as the activity usually comes back after the medications are stopped and steroids have many side effects.  The marker of thyroid activity is a test called tsh (with some limitations that you need not know), but if it is low, this means that the thyroid is overactive and if it is high, this means that the thyroid is underactive.  If you are found to have a hyperactive thyroid state, then this is definitely the cause behind palpitations.  i would suggest to have a tsh done, and if it is found to be low, then you have a state of overactive thyroid and if the palpitations amongst other symptoms are really bothering you, then, a medication could be given to alleviate all those symptoms and it is called inderal, it is a prescription drug and it has to be taken under medical supervision. It is administred only temporarily until this phase ends. Many patients after that continue to have normal thyroid functions but many of them end up having an underactive thyroid for which thyroid replacement is indicated.  i assume that you are seeing an endocrinologist, if you are not, i think it would not be such a bad idea if your doctor refers you to one.

    "content": "Dear Jessedolphins,  To decide whether or not chest pain is related to coronary disease, risk factors for coronary disease and the characteristics of the chest pain (as compared to characteristics of chest pain of coronary disease origin) are assessed. You don't have any risk factor for coronary disease and your chest pain (even though your description lacks some of the things that i would like to know), yet still i think it is atypical for chest pain of coronary origin.  When did you start having these symptoms? What are usually doing when you feel these symptoms? What makes the pain come and what do you think makes it go away?  i think that this pain is not related to coronary disease and i think that this condition is related to either a chest wall condition (muscle pains for example) or a lung condition called pleurisy (mild inflammation of the membrane surrounding the lung). i can not say for sure what is this related to.  Chest pain has so many causes, i think you need to see your doctor to have a physical and have a definitive diagnosis.  Even though it does not sound like reflux disease, yet reflux can present with a variety of strange symptoms.   In addition to visiting your doctor, i would recommend that you try anti-acids and see the response but the problem is going to be that you sometimes have considerable periods of time when you don't have the pain, so may be we won't be able to differentiate between the medication effect and the resolution of the pain on its own but i still think it is worth a try.  An echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) at your age is not an unreasonable thing to do as many of the times, atypical chest pain in your age group proves to be secondary to a condition called mitral valve prolapse that is very easily detectable by echocardiogram but your symptoms are not very typical of this condition though.

My primary concern is that I occasionally get a burning pain in my left arm from the shoulder (under the armpit)  to about the elbow. It also seems to spread up my neck under the jawline. (it feels as if I recently exercised that arm, but I haven't.) Predominantly this feeling comes shortly after strenuous work. For example, mowing the lawn, jogging up a steep hill, shoveling. though once it happened when I was just sitting down at work. On the occasion that it happened after shoveling 2 low strength adult aspirin and lying down for 10 minutes helped considerably. However sometimes this pain can linger for several days to a week with varying intenisity. There is rarely any pain in my chest around the rib cage and breastbone, and no tightness. When the discomfort is in my neck I find myself feeling extremely tired, run down, etc. This again seems to clear up once the discomfort goes away.  I've been back and forth to the doctor's office and the ER. EKG test was completely normal, bloodwork was completely normal (aside from that pesky cholesterol thing which I'm working on). I was initially diagnosed with pluerisy. Symptoms went away then came back after about a week. Went back to the doctor's and scheduled a treadmill stress test. Completed that test and the results were again completely normal. Not even so much as a hint of a problem. Also the discomfort could not be reproduced on the treadmil (and I was on it a good 20 minutes). Chest X-Rays show no abnormalities in heart, lungs or liver. So I was diagnosed with Acid Reflux. This seems particularly strange since my stomach isn't upset in the least. And all my discomfort is centered around my left jawbone, neck, and arm. I've had my doctor listen to the arteries in my neck as well, and they don't hear anything that would give them an indication that something was wrong. It's getting frustrating to continually have these symptoms and yet be told there's nothing wrong, or that it's all in my head.   Other symptoms which may be directly or indirectly related are a ringing in my left ear, possibly from TMJ (I should also have my wisdom teeth removed). Also, I occasionally have blurred vision, which may or may not be due to my contacts.   Like I said, the whole thing is getting quite frustrating. Any advice?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Nephilim78,  Definitely, your chest pain is not due to coronary disease.   Chest pain has so many other causes including reflux disease. Somtimes reflux presents with the strangest of symptoms, i am not sure whether or not your symptoms are due to reflux but the treatment for reflux is not that harmful and there are lots of medications for it that are not that expensive, so i am not against you trying the reflux treatment for a while and see whether or not it controls your symptoms.  Personally, i have a bias. If a patient complains of neck pain, arm pain or tingling, numbness, discomfort, etc... in addition to chest discomfort that proves not to be of coronary origin, the first thing that comes to mind is neck problems like arthritis, muscle spasms, overuse of neck and shoulder muscles. So, a neck x-ray, a neck ct scan would not be bad ideas if your doctor thinks either is indicated.  In your case, i think it would not hurt to rule out mitral valve prolapse, and this is done by doing an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart).  Even though this is a remote possibility, but a case of post-herpetic neurlagia might be considered (but this would be a very long shot).

    "title": "Re: Chest pains at very young age",
    "content": "Dear Spartan Tyrant,  At your age, this chest pain, if due to a heart problem, is more probably due to   1. A condition called mitral valve prolapse. Usually, this is a benign condition that just needs follow-up unless it is associated with a murmur which is a noise heard on heart examination (and this means that there is associated mitral valve regurgitation). This condition usually causes atypical chest pain and it is usually associated with palpitations espeically after meals. This could be the case in your condition.  2. Inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart but it does not sound that this is the case in your condition.  Chest pain also has many non-heart causes. From your description, this could be related to muscular strain or a very minor inflammation in the membrane surrounding the lungs.  You can try over the counter pain relievers. If you want to make sure that you don't have mitral valve prolapse, you can mention it to your doctor with your next visit. Usually an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart) is done if your doctor thinks it is indicated.

The information that is printed on the top of an EKG report is what the machine interprets and depends largely on the EKG lead placement and occasionally reports incorrectly. The person reading the EKG looks at the rhythm's and not just at the information printed on the top of the report. If your physician has reviewed your EKG and didn't seem concerned, it's likely that it was due to the lead placement. I hope this helps. Good luck with your biopsy. I hope all turns out well.

If the ecg still shows the anterior infarction pattern, then i would suggest that you get an echocardiogram.

    "content": "Hi, I am a 30 yom. I am a firefighter in good shape, running and working out regularly. My heart itself is in great shape physically (pass stress test yearly with good scores), but my electrical system is pretty mixed up and seems to be stumping my docs and me.   Since I was 19, I've had PVCs and PACs (on stress tests too), no big deal. Then a number of years ago, I had an episode of A-fib (not known then what it was). Event recorder for a month, no repeat so not diagnosed. I ignored it for several years to prevent risk of it affecting my job.  Finally the last couple years, A-fib began lasting up to 8 hours at a time. After an hour, dyspnea and fatigue would start. These episodes were sporadic, lasting between 1-8 hours a few times a year, then every couple months, mostly at night while trying to sleep. Still didn't want to go to the doc for fear of my job.  Then last year, I had a near black out while driving. I can usually always feel every beat every day. It was beating normal, then I suddenly felt it stop, began to black out, got to the side of the road, hard thump, then very tachycardic. Dizzy about a 1/2 hour after. This got me back to the doctor. Captured A-fib on event recorder couple weeks later, but no more pauses (felt same as when I noted a-fib above, which is why I figure above noted items [exc. blackout] was a-fib).  EP study and attempt ablation scheduled. Was in a-fib as soon as medication started, so determined no ablation could occur. Finally diagnosed as vagal a-fib. Various med combos tried, all made arrythmias significantly worse. After several attempts, I elected not to try more.   Was selected for ablation by Dr. Jackman in OKC. At this point having a number of rate changes for no reason. Normal resting for me about 60, will jump from 60-120+ at rest for no reason, sometimes gradual, sometimes instant. Dr. on staff there and a 2nd here stated appears more going on. OKC doc stated needed to get electrodes placed inside near nodes (I think) to determine what else was going on due to so much elec. activity? Anyway, thanks to insurance, procedure fell through.  Now, having very frequent (daily) episodes of sporadic chest pain. Also multiple rate changes and occasional SOB. Just completed additional monitor hard wired that takes recording from 1 min. prior to when I press the button. First sending, receiving company stated dangerously fast (moderate physical activity for about 5 min.) at around 180. Was back fine after 15 min. Another sent after chest pain and company stated a wave change was noted that I needed to talk to the doc about, but still within normal levels. (Also, last stress test for job 6 months ago, computer flagged a problem before starting, but I denied to them any cardiac issues due to job. They allowed stress to continue believing it was a computer glich. I was on meds then, thouhgt maybe related to them). A-fib hasn't been an issue last several months, only lasting 1-5 min. when it happens, but everything else is.  So here I am. Just wanting other ideas as to what's going on. Thank you for reading the long winded post.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Multiple arrythmias",
    "content": "Dear Fyrmnk,   i am sure that before you were labelled with the diagnosis of vagal atrial fibrillation, all other causes of atrial fibrillation were excluded, such a hyperactive thyroid gland among others. This is very important.   i am sure that you had a not at all good experience (i don't want to say painful) with the medications combination trials and that is why you decided not to try anything else. But what are the medications that you tried?   Your chest pain episodes from what i understand seem to be associated with the rapid heart rate that you get. You having chest pain means that your heart rate is so fast that the coronaries don't have time to fill with enough blood (to supply the heart) and then the heart muscle starts to complain by giving you this chest pain. You have to contact your cardiologist with these symptoms as soon as possible. You have to be evaluated.   i am not sure what other options your electrophysiologist discussed with you regarding how to deal with the atrial fibrillation. In my opinion, remember i am not an electrophysiologist, you have a few options.   1. To have good heart rate control and never mind about whether or not you are back in normal rhythm and have blood thinners, i hope you are on them now, because patients who have atrial fibrillation have a significantly higher incidence of stroke than people who don't.   2. Have an ablation of your atrioventricular node, the passage that conducts the electrical impulses from the atria (where the atrial fibrillation starts) to the ventricles (the actual heart rate is not the one that the atria produce but the number of impulses conducted to the ventricles). And after having ablation have a pacemaker implanted. i am not sure what is the ablation that your electrophysiologist deemed unfeasible. i think that this might be a too of a permanent solution as you are young as is but there are many young patients as you are who have had this done.   3. Have what is known as an anti-tachycardia device. This is basically a device that will give a shock every time you have one of these episodes. It is not a comfortable thing and i am not sure whether the fda approved it for use in atrial fibrillation or not.   In any case, i think it is very important that you be on anticoagulation (blood thinners) as long as you continue to have these episodes of atrial fibrillation.

    "content": "Hi Doctor, thanks for the reply. Yes, all other forms were ruled out. I had to stop meds because of multiple side effects with each, including various other arrythmias.   In addition to the a-fib without meds, I also have other arrythmias, including occasional slight bradychardia, tachycardia at rest (normal resting is 60 for me, hits 120+ at rest on occasion), SVT w/o a-fib, pvcs and pacs, and pauses.  Can't do option 2 or 3 because I will lose my job if either are implanted. Can't do Coumadin or related because of risk due to job and active lifestyle. I do take a full strength aspirin a day though.  Have discrepency on when I should go get cardioverted when in a-fib. Had one cardiologist (heart failure prevention spec.) say no longer then 6-8 hours. My current one says he thinks I can make it 24 hours w/o stroke risk, so I'm planning on cardioversion if I stay in over 12 hours. They do say staying in for a length of time is hard on the muscle.  Thanks again.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Multiple arrythmias",
    "content": "Dear Fyrmnk,   Thank you very much for the update.  Having pauses and getting fast heart rate at the same time has always been a tough situation. The treatment is obviously something to treat both but the dilemma is if something is given to treat the tachycardia, it will worsen the bradycardia and if something is given to treat the bradycardia, it will worsen the tachycardia. So, usually, and once more, a pacemaker is inserted and medications to prevent tachycardia from occuring are usually given. But, obviously this is not going to be the case in your situation.  Regarding how long would you wait before going in for a cardioversion, first of all, the longer you wait, the harder it is to cardiovert. The consensus is never to wait more than 48 hours otherwise there is a big chance that a blood clot has formed inside the cavity of the heart and if cardioversion is performed, this clot breaks and goes wherever in the body causing a variety of problems, the commonest of which is a stroke. That is why, if 48 hours pass and a patient is in atrial fibrillation, the patient is not cardioverted, placed on blood thinners and comes back later may be at 3 weeks or so to have cardioversion and then remains 3-4 more weeks on blood thinners before the danger of embolization is gone.  You never mentioned anything about the results of an echocardiogram but i am sure that several were done. If the size of the left atrium is bigger than normal, some cardiologists let the patient remain in atrial fibrillation and start anticoagulation because if the left atrium is bigger than normal the chances of atrial fibrillation coming back are really high.  Continuous tachycardia does cause the heart muscle to be weaker.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

I went for my 3rd echocardiogram (last one was in 1989, just had one in May 2003)     After my echo the cardiologist came in and told me \"Good news, you have a normal heart... well as normal as it can be-- you have a stenosis but the pressure gradient is low and nothing to worry about\"   I asked him if it would ever get worse and he said \"Probably not, if it hasn't already... but you can come back if you like in 2-3 years and we can do another follow up\"  Well I went in to see my GP last week and he had the final document from the cardiologist.  He told me \"Yeah, looks like everything is good with your heart\" then continued to say \"He found the pulmonary stenosis-- also trivial regurgitation in the other three valves\"    So of course after reading I find out that trivial regurgitation is normal-- but not so in the aortic valve.   Is this something that can progress?   Neither docs seemed to be concerned; not sure if this is just a \"fluke\" that the echo picks up or not.    Worried,  Mike\n\n",

    "content": "This is unrelated but I'd thought maybe you could answer this:   My overall health has been great-- no symptoms.   My last lipid profile from 3 years ago was:  (when I ate ALL fast food) unrestricted diet  Total cholesterol:  214 HDL:   46 LDL:   149  I have done the diet change for the last few years and my latest was:  Total cholesterol:  185 (was 182 six-months ago) HDL:  56 (was 65 six-months ago) VLDL:  16  LDL:  112 (was 102 six-months ago) LDL/HDL ratio:  2.0   So my cholesterol has remained under control since my diet change...   My GP says \"maybe you should take a baby-asprin, I'd hate to see you have an early heart attack since you have two risk factors already\"   I asked him what my two factors were and he said \"cholesterol and blood pressure\"   I asked him why the cholesterol since I have it LDL under 130--- he said \"because it was high once before\"  So is this a valid statement and still considered a risk factor if my cholesterol is within normal range?   My BP uncontrolled (3 years ago) used to be 140-150 / 80-90   Now with 25mg Atenolol it is around 132/80 and sometimes as low as 124/80 if I sit for awhile (bp machine at WalMart)   So is my blood pressure also a risk factor still?  My family history:   Mother's side (her father died from asbestos related lung damage at 76)  my mom's Mother alive and well at 84.   Father's side:   Both grandparents alive 87/85 years old; both parents are alive and well  52/54.   There are no history of any heart attacks in our family except for my grandfather's brother (who I think is too distant to render this in family medical history)  So do you think my GP is kind of over exagerating my heart attack risk?   Should I find a new GP?   My heart condition shouldn't warrant him to worry-- he also orders full CBC and chem13 (also thyroid tests) each year (which always come back normal)   Also he wants me to come in for lipid profiles every 6 months (I think thats a little much since I've remained relatively good for the past 3 years)  Sorry this is so long...

However, since you have pulmonary stenosis and you are going to be evaluated at least every couple of years, i would not worry a lot unless you start having new symptoms like new onset shortness of breath on exertion, palpitations, ect...  Regarding the baby aspirin, you have treated high blood pressure which means that you have high blood pressure but since it is under well control, the risk drops significantly but it does not mean it is not there.   Regarding the lipid profile, your ldl and hdl values are great without any medications, so keep up the good work. Of course having high lipids is one of the big risk factors in coronary disease.  The real risk of coronary disease in males starts at the age of 40 especially if they have premature coronary disease history in first degree relatives. So, currently i don't think that there is an urge to start you on a baby aspirin every day but once you hit 40, your gp will a very strong case to advice you to do so.

    "title": "Finally got to see the echo report",
    "content": "Today I finally had the echo faxed to me in regards to earlier questions (thank you so much for answering)     1.  Nothing is noted about high pulmonary pressure but is 33 mmHg considered normal provided what is listed here?    2.  I never had confirmed diagnoses of \"pulmonary stenosis\" but do have a systolic murmur 2-3 left sternal border.  Could this be an innocent pulmonic flow murmur since they found nothing wrong?     3.  Is the \"borderline left ventricular hypertrophy\" probably related to my uncontrolled blood pressure from years ago?   Is this something that could get worse?  Thank you so much!  **ECHO REPORT** The M-Mode measurements demonstrate left atrial size of 3.9 cm, aortic root 2.6 cm.  The thickness of the septum and posterior wall is 1.2 cm.  End-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions are 4.9 and 3.2cm.  2-dimensional echo:  The 2-d images demonstrate unremarkable septal motion, unremarkable posterior wall motion and the left atrial size appears to be unremarkable, as does the aortic valve itself.  The mitral, aortic and tricuspid valves all show good motion without thickening or abnormalities morphologically.   There is no pericardial effusion noted.  The aortic valve showes three leaflets in the short axis view and the tricuspid valve does not show any gross abnormalities.  The pulmonary valve is not well visualized.  In some views we actually do see the pulmonary valve and it shows that the leaflets move quite well.  There are no obvious signs of supravalvular stenosis or infundibular stenosis from the available views.  The right ventricle appears to be within normal limits, as does the right atrium.  Color Doppler:  Dopper interrogation demonstrates antegrade flows across the aortic valve are 2.1 m/sec which would give a mean gradient of 8.4 mmHg.  There is trivial aortic insufficiency noted.  There are antegrade flows across the mitral valve which are unremarkable, and there is trivial mitral regurgitation.  There is mild tricuspid insufficiency with a pulmonary pressure estimated at around 33 mmHg.  The last views across the pulmonary valve show a 1.7 m/sec velocity which would give a peak gradient of 11.6 mmHg and a mean gradient of 6.6 mmHg.  These numbers are considered trivial.  Impression:  1.  Preserved systolic performance of the left ventricle. 2.  Unremarkable chamber dimensions 3.  Borderline left ventricular hypertrophy 4.  Trivial mitral and aortic valve insufficiency. 5.  Mild tricuspid insufficiency. 6.  Increased flows across the pulmonic valve without significant pressure gradient estimate.  This patient has an essentially unremarkable heart with borderline left ventricular hypertrophy and increased antegrade flows across the pulmonary valve without discrete significant gradient.    Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Maestro300,  Thank you very much for the update.  Regarding your questions.  1. A systolic pulmonary pressure of 33 is just elevated above the cut-off of what is considered high pulmonary pressure which is 30.  2. The degree of loudness of the murmur has nothing to do with how severe a lesion is if any. A murmur is caused by turbulence in the blood flow, whether this blood is flowing through a stenosed valve or not, this is a different story.   3. The left ventricular hypertrophy like you said is most probably related to hypertension. It could get worse if hypertension is not very well controlled.  4. Normally, during systole, there should not be any gradient between the left ventricle and the aorta. i don't think that i can predict whether or not you are going to develop aortic stenosis.

However, now that I see the report on paper...results say L atrial size is normal, right atrium is slightly prominent.  L ventr. EF is 70%, mild mitral and tricuspid insufficiency, pulmonary hypertension, with a R ventricular pressure of 45mmHg.  In your opinion, would this warrant a follow up with a cardiologist?

    "content": "Dear Shannan,  You have pulmonary hypertension which means high pressure within the pulmonary circulation.  This is oversimplification of things but pulmonary hypertension is of two types:  1. Primary: Of unknown cause. 2. Secondary: Main causes are either cardiovascular (related to the heart and the blood vessels) or pulmonary (related to the lungs including blood clots to the lungs if you had any).  The echocardiogram should have shown any obvious cardiac causes of pulmonary hypertension but it did not. So, we will assume that your heart is not the cause. The causes that are related to the blood vessels have to be investigated by doing some blood tests. So, assuming that you don't have lung disease including previous blood clots to the lungs and the blood tests come back negative, you might have primary pulmonary hypertension. Remember that i said that this is oversimplification of things.  Your profile says that you had a c-section in the past, so i assume you had a pregnancy that went on well and ended by delivery of the baby at full term.  i don't know though whether this is your first echo or not. If this is your first echo then we don't know what was your pulmonary pressure status during the first pregnancy but i assume you had a full term pregnancy which means that at that time, your heart was ok.  With pregnancy several cardiovascular changes occur and there is strain on the heart with its peak around the 26th-28th week of pregnancy and if you have any heart problem you might go into heart failure and the problem with pregnant females is that they look like they have heart failure (they ar short of breath and they have edema of the legs) and sometimes it is not easy to differentiate.  In my opinion, pulmonary hypertension is not something that should be dealt with lightly and go without being investigated and followed-up carefully.  My recommendation to you at this point is to see either a cardiologist or pulmonologist according to your primary care physician preferrence.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Mokhtar, Thank you for the reply.  Yes, my last child was full term, and there were no complications.  I'm wondering if strenuous exercise can cause the pulmonary hypertension?  This echo was done last Nov.(first and only echo) and I was training for the Disney Marathon.  I'm not a fast runner, I would just stay at a nice easy steady pace, but I was doing long durations. Although, I didn't run for about a week before the echo.  Is it also possible that the hypertension was already there and the exercising just exaggerated the pressure? My primary didn't recommend any follow up or anything, said that it was basically normal.  That's why I didn't take care of this until now (26wks pregnant). It's the first time I ever saw the report.  Thank you again! Shannan\n\n",

    "content": "Dear cdavis,  Was the puncture of the needle through which they passed the cath in the groin or somewhere else?   If it was in the groin which i assume most cardiologist do, i would recommend calling your doctor telling him about the sympoms (to see what he will recommend for pain medications, but i don't see an urgency in going in) and waiting for 2-3 days and if the pain is still there or getting worse, i would then recommend that you go in to be checked.  If the punture was in the subclavian or internal jugular veins and on the left side, i would urge you to call your doctor and go in to have a chest x-ray.  The pain that you are having could be caused by either pleural irritation or muscle pain secondary to the spasm that you had.

At both visits blood tests, chest xrays and EKG's were performed and didn't reveal anthing.  My cholesterol and bp are in the upper range of normal.  My chest pains do not fit the various descriptions i've read of heart disease related pains.  It is not overly painful, and not constant.  Almost like tiny deep muscle cramps all around the sternum and upper pectoral on either side.  I haven't been able to detect a trend as to when it occurs, but I know it doesn't come on after exertion or eating.  It just seems random.  It doesn't affect my work or sleep, but it has me nervous.  I've got almost no stress in my life, unless i'm subconsciously stressed.  I've enjoyed junk food and hated vegetables my whole life... but is it possible to have heart disease despite acceptable blood pressure and cholesterol?  Maybe diabetes?  Maybe a thoracic nerve is compressed?  You're opinions would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Heart rate after exercise",
    "content": "Recently I have decided to start exercising. For a week, I have been jogging for 10 minutes a day and I plan to extend this 10 minutes every week until I reach the point where I am exercising an hour a day. I have not exercised in over a year, and when I started a few days ago, I realized that it took a while for my heart rate to decrease after exercise. My resting heart rate is from 70 to 85, and sometimes it goes up to 90. Whenever I exercise, my heart rate is anywhere from 160 to 190, but sometimes it gets awfully close to 200 but generally stays around a 180. However, this worries me, considering that I am not doing a rigorous exercise. Also, after a few minutes after exercise, my heart rate goes down to a 90. However, it takes a while, usually about an hour and a half to go back to the 80's. This also worries me because according to most medical sources, it states that heart rate goes back to normal within minutes. Also two months ago I went to the doctor because I was feeling fluttering sensations in my chest, and they gave me an ECG, and they said my heart was normal and my heart rate was around a 88.  Would you suggest continuing my exercise, and should I be worried about my fast heart rate? Sometimes, I feel a very weak pain in the center of my chest which goes away when I slow down a little bit. Should I be worried? And will my heart become stronger and beat slower as a result of continuous exercise over time? Sorry this is so long but I have many questions. Please respond to me asap and if possible, please e mail your response to KentaroMiura89@AOL.com   .   Worried  \"Kinko\"\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your maximum heart rate is about 220 minus your age (thats your max or 100%). Your heart rate zone during exercise should be 100-150 beats per minute (50%-75%). You are right to pace yourself since you have been inactive for so long.   When starting an exercise program, aim at the lowest part of your target zone (50 percent) during the first few weeks. Gradually build up to the higher part of your target zone (75 percent). After six months or more of regular exercise, you may be able to exercise comfortably at up to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate. However, you don't have to exercise that hard to stay in shape. These figures are averages, so use them as general guidelines.  So it seems that your working too hard and should reduce the intensity of your exercise at least for now.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I have been diagnosed with sinus tachycardia (resting about 95-105, standing 115-130, walking 135-160).  My doctor says this is nothing to worry about, so I am not worried.  I was put on Diltiazem but kept passing out, having dizzy spells, etc.  I decided to stop taking it on my own and since then the passing out has stopped (my Blood Pressure used to drop when I stood up to below 85/55).  I do not mind having blood pressure a little on the high side (135-170/90-120), and actually feel better.  It has only been above 200/130 a couple of times and I was already in the hospital (pneumonia) and the doctor did not seem to think it was that big of a deal.  How long can I have high blood pressure before it is a problem?  Is it a problem with the fast heart rate?\n\n",

    "title": "Re:Sinus tachycardia ok but what about hypertension with it?",
    "content": "Dear Fearuvhorses,  Thank you very much for using our website.  A couple of thoughts.  Having tachycardia when you stand up might be due to a condition called orthostatic tachycardia which might be caused by autonomic neuropathy (affection of the nerves of the involuntary nervous system) that happens to diabetics and in a neurological condition called multiple sclerosis.  i am not sure whether you also had drop in your blood pressure when you stand up only when you were taking diltiazem or even before that because if you were having drop in blood pressure even before you start taking diltiazem then this is called orthostatic hypotension (and although it does not make sense to have hypertension at the same time yet it is one of the challenging situations in medicine).  i am not sure whether you have other symptoms of autonomic neuropathy such as diarrhea, feeling of bloating and early satiety and indigestion and sometimes if you vomit, it seems like the food that you are vomiting is the one that you ate may be a couple of days ago. You might also have some skin problems such as thickening of the nails, itching and dry skin. These symptoms,  among others, are the most common symptoms of autonomic neuropathy.   This could also be caused by medications that you might be taking like diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide and lasix (if you take too much, you can become dehydrated and have tachycardia and low blood pressure when you stand up). Other causes of tachycardia and low blood pressure when you stand up is an underactive adrenal gland.  An overactive thyroid gland can be a cause for sinus tachycardia as well.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jananna,   Thank you very much for using our website.   The best thing to do is to have an Ekg (electric drawing of the heart) during these episodes. It will allow to see the exact rate and the rhythm of the heart and whether normal or abnormal.   Meanwhile, till you see your doctor try to remain calm. Cut down on the coffee or any caffeinated beverages (pop, mountain due, etc...), stop smoking if you are, and try to get enough sleep and avoid over exertion.   Usually the blood tests will be in the form of electrolyes, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus levels and thyroid function tests because disturbance in the heart rhythm is sometimes associated with abnormalities of these parameters.   i can not tell what this is unless you have an Ekg unfortunately.

    "content": "Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for using our website.  On the electrocardiogram (e.c.g.), myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) have a certain pattern and one can identify these patterns easily.  The problem is that an electrocardiogram is operator dependant.  Confusion can regarding having previous anterior infarcts on the e.c.g. This is because the anterior wall of the heart is under the chest wall and the electrical impulses coming from the anterior wall of the heart are picked up by the leads that are placed on the chest wall. These leads have specific places to be placed and if for any reason, the operator misplaces the leads (which sometimes happen), then the e.c.g. could have a reading of an anterior infarction.   From the message i could understand that you did not have a heart attack in the past and are otherwise healthy. Even without a history of heart attacks for which you were hospitalized, a silent heart attack could happen and this occurs most commonly in patients with hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes.

    "content": "Dear Doobssis,   Thank you very much for using our website.   Taking fen-phen as a combination for appetite suppression to lose weight has been implicated in causing some problems with heart valves.   The fen-phen could cause what you have on your echocardiogram report which is mitral valve regurgitation.   My advice to you is to see a heart specialist as you will have to have serial echocardiograms to make sure that the lesions are stable and because you will have to be followed by a doctor for this condition that you have as it might progress and cause some heart failure.   After cessation of the medications, the valve lesions are stable and tend to be reversible in many cases. Some could get worse, however.   If you are going to have any surgical procedure or go to the dentist or have any medical procedure, your doctor should be aware of what you have and you should receive antibiotics to gard against infection of the diseased valve.

When read on an ecg this implies that the ischemia is in the heart secondary to blockage in the coronary arteries.

If the interpretation that you read on your ecg is made by the ecg machine itself then it is 100% not reliable unless it was confirmed by a physician.  You have to go back to your doctor (or the doctor who did the annual physical exam) and ask him about the ecg results.

    "content": "Dear guest,   Thank you very much for using our website.  How old are you? Male or female? Do you have any first degree relatives who had heart attack before? Do you have any risk factors for coronary disease like cigarette smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, physical inactivity?  Do you have any symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath when you walk or do any activity?  Have you ever had a stress test?  If you do not have any risk factors and you are asymptomatic then coronary disease although not impossible still yet very remote.  If you have risk factors or symptoms then it is better to have a stress test.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",
