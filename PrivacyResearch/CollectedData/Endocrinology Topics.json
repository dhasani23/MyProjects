    "content": "Hi Lakita,  The bones can continue to significant growth only until the growth plates close.  After the growth plates have closed, the chances of significant height increase are minimal.  For girls, by age 18 the growth plates are likely closed up so, unfortunately, I suspect you won't gain a lot more height.  You may gain another 1/2 inch or so but probably not much more.   To predict adult height, the mother and father's height can be averaged together with a correction factor for the child being a boy or girl (adding 5 inches to mom's height for boys, subtracting 5 inches from dad's height for girls then dividing the sum of the two heights by 2).  For you, your mid-parental height would be  5' 1\".  This is the estimate of the 50'th percentile for your predicted height.  If you are now 4' 8\" you are still within the range of expected heights.  The bad news is that there is very little that you can do (or could have done) about your ultimate height.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If the TSH isn't normal you may want to see an endocrinologist or your primary care doctor for further testing to see why it is abnormal and if treatment is necessary.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: pregnancy sans pituitary gland?",
    "content": "Hello Theleatherwing,  This is a little bit of a difficult question to answer.  If the pituitary gland was completely removed then pregnancy is essentially impossible since the pituitary gland makes FSH and LH, which control the development and release of eggs and the menstrual cycle, basically.  If, by chance, enough of the pituitary gland was left that LH and FSH are still being made pregnancy is possible; however, if this were the case, one would expect the menstrual cycle to continue to be normal without the need for birth control pills.  (I am assuming she was started on the birth control to replace her natural hormonal cycles that are now not being stimulated by LH and FSH.)  The odds lean in favor of pregnancy being highly unlikely.  I suspect her cycle will start soon but if not, I would recommend she take a pregnancy test just to be sure.    Best wishes.\n\n",

A few months back I started dieting and exercising more than my usual 3 days a week. I have also used diet pills. With all of the changes I managed to lose 1 pound. After doing research I believe that this has something to do with a possible hormone imbalance. With Ortho Evra having such an extremely high amount of estrogen in it, is it likely that my body is lacking estrogen? Is it more likely that I have become androgen dominant or estrogen dominant? Since being off birth control I have also developed painful acne and I have had a few ovarian cysts.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Jess4mela,  It is actually common for women to gain weight after stopping hormonal birth control.  Hormonal control is fairly complex in the body and the sex hormones influence many different systems.  Often what we see is that women will have some some rebound type symptoms after stopping birth control.  This does not necessarily mean that you have become androgen dominant.  It likely simply means your seeing more fluctuation in hormone levels that is causing your symptoms.  When on the patch, your hormone levels become very consistent and level things out.  From the information you've provided it sounds like your body is working properly.  Women do use hormonal contraception to treat the symptoms you are describing and some women choose to continue on them simply for purposes of control of acne or cysts.  Talking with your doctor can help you decide how best to proceed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Cutting a tablet to make a 162.5 dose would essentially do the same thing but then you have to deal with cutting tablets, which may or may not be easy depending on the tablet.  If you do opt for cutting the tablet, be sure your doctor is aware of this and approves it.  Some pills cannot be cut or it messes up their timed release.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism in 2006 ans my doctor prescribed Synthroid. We started on 50 mcg, went up to 100mcg, then up to 150mcg with a period of 2 years. Once I got tested she told me 150mcg was a little too high and dropped it to 125 mcg.  I don't know why, but she switched me to Levothyroxine since 2008, and that's what I have been taking (125mcg)  I feel that some aspects of my life have greatly improved but other things went bad and Im not sure if they are related to this medication. My weight stabilized, my digestive system got much better (before being on this med, I used to defecate 2-3 time s a month, and now I defecate daily), my energy levels is better, but I feel like there's oil sipping out of me. Im almost 28 years old until i started taking the thyroid medication my scalp, face, back and chest have been really oily and have been having bad breakouts. My whole teenage years I never had 1 pimple and my hair was extremely dry, that's what astonishes me about this. I actually have been diagnosed with severe dryness by my eye doctors (for lack or tearing) and by the dentists (for lack of saliva)  I also have started having joint pains. First on my knees, then on shoulders, elbows, ankles and hips (never had pain on fingers or toes)  My energy level has improved; I was always tired before. However, I drink 2-3 cups of coffee everyday and that helps with my energy. While reading through the older posts I came across some about using levothyroxine with caffeine and it really got me worried for 2 reasons:  1) it seems that 125 mcg is high compared to others!  2) Along, with the levothyroxine I have been drinking a lot of coffee these last few years. Should I stop it? Could I have had any damage from this?  Im a student and have no health insurance so I just visit the community clinic every year. No one ever told me to avoid any kinds of foods, but some posts mentioned to avoid oild, carbs etc. Could you tell me exactly what I should be avoiding?  Im a very healthy person, eat well and exercise regularly. don't take any other medicine, but do take fish oil, calcium and vitamin c daily.  I have also been taking aleve for the joint pain and the inflamation on my face. I know its not the most optimal solution but its the only one I have. Please give me some pointers on what to do to deal with the oily face and scalp, joint pain, and caffeine intake.  Thank you very much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Andraded,  I would recommend you follow up with your doctor.  You likely need to have your thyroid levels tested.  125 mcg's is a respectable dose but not necessarily high.  The important thing is to match what the body needs.  This is done by testing a hormone called thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).  If the TSH is in the normal range, the dose is correct regardless of how high or low the dose is.    Thyroid medication dose needs can change over time and regular testing of TSH is important.  If you are getting too much or too little you can definitely feel miserable since thyroid hormone impacts nearly every system in the body.  If you do not have insurance there are often clinics in town that will see patients on a no fee or sliding fee scale depending on income and ability to pay.  Your local health department can help you find these clinics.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: hypothyroid convert in hyper thyroid due to medication",
    "content": "Hello Rajeshrisoni,  TSH is thyroid stimulating hormone.  It is made by the pituitary gland to stimulate the thyroid gland to make the thyroid hormones T3 and T4.  T4 is more stable and is generally measures to look for function.  Because TSH is a stimulating hormone, it will react in the opposite direction of the body state (i.e. if the body is low on thyroid hormone, the TSH goes up, if the body is high on thyroid hormone the TSH goes down).  TSH will continue to respond to the thyroid hormone taken by mouth as well, so TSH is used to titrate the oral medication.  If the TSH goes high, the medication needs increased.  If TSH goes low, the medication needs decreased.    There is one piece of information that is missing to help me in interpreting your labs-the normal values for your lab.  A common normal range for TSH is 0.4-4; however, this varies from lab to lab.  So, if a TSH of 0.06 is normal for your lab then your dose is appropriate.  If it is low, you may need to decrease the dose a bit.  Do not do this without the advice and direction of your doctor.  The thyroid regulates nearly every system in the body so care must be taken when adjusting the medicine.  Your doctor may feel that even though the TSH may be a little low, if everything is working right he may want you to stay on the dose you are on.    Regular checks of TSH are necessary as the body's need for amounts varies from time to time so a stable dose for years may need to be adjusted at some point.  A common evaluation time is 3-6 months (sometimes longer in certain situations).  Your doctor will help you.  Regarding  breastfeeding, your baby's thyroid should be regulating his levels.  Taking thyroid medicine while breastfeeding is safe and is important to help keep mom healthy and able to care for baby.  Best wishes.\n\n",

She had a saliva test ran and told me I had adrenal insuffiency.  I decided to seek the opinion of an endocrinologist.    After seeing my labs from the physicans assistant, he started me on 40mg of cortisone acetate.  Drew blood and told me to return in a week.  When I returned he ran the ACTH Stim test.  The results of the test showed I didn't stimulate any.  The blood drawn prior to the injection showed 18 and my 30 minute draw after the injection was 19, the hour blood draw was 18.  Based on this, my endo said I had adrenal failure.    I was concerned about the accuracy of the test since I was taking the Cortisone Acetate for a week prior to the test.  I asked my endo and he said the first blood he took would serve as a baseline and I should still \"stimulate\" after the injection.  My friends theory was that my body had shut down production of cortisol since I was on the CA making the results inaccurate.   Is a week on CA long enough to shut down my natural production of cortisol?  Does CA interfer with the ACTH test?     Do I need to wean off the CA and retest?   Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Phislth1,  This is a tricky question.  Cortisone and cortisol (the body hormone made by the adrenal glands) are exactly the same compound and the cortisone taken by mouth will be picked up by the lab test. Your endocrinologist is correct that the adrenal glands should still be stimulated by ACTH; however, this response can be blunted by being on the cortisone itself.  Taking exogenous (not made by the body) cortisone will suppress the adrenal glands.  The higher the dose and the longer the exposure, the more the suppression and the longer it will take for them to come back.  This is why it is often necessary to wean off cortisone or steroids slowly.  I cannot answer how much the cortisone could effect your test results but it certainly can effect the results through several methods.  I would recommend you continue to follow up with your doctor about this to determine the best way to proceed.  As an aside, salivary cortisol levels are not the best way to do these tests.  Blood samples really should be used to guide therapy.  They are much more reliable.  I should be clear that I am not saying the endocrinologist is wrong regarding how the test results are interpreted.  There clearly was not a response from the adrenal gland.  The question is did the adrenal glands get suppressed from the cortisone you are taking and would they respond if you were off the cortisone.  This part needs to be figured out by your doctors.  I would also warn you not to stop taking the cortisone abruptly or without the advice of your doctors as this can be very dangerous if your adrenal glands are not responding appropriately (even life threatening in some cases).  Best wishes.\n\n",

Feel terrible all of the time, very tired and sleepy all of the time, feel really unwell, sexually I have basically no sex drive, get no morning erections, can get hard at times but not interested in sex what so ever.  I feel emotional and depressed at best of times, severe lack of energy. Everythings an effort to do. Constant headaches all of the time severe pressure in my head all day almost, had my eyes checked incase it was related to that but nothing back.  As for latest medical issue was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in march ended up in hospital for 1 month and was on high doses of steroids (prednisolone) had a lot of side effects and was recently back on them again as it flared up. Seems after this point in march everything has just went down hill. Feel depressed, angry, mood swings and emotional. Get hot flushes and stressed out and severe headaches but the biggest problem being sexual problem not interested in sex at all, zero confidence etc.  Currently a natural bodybuilder at 16 stone and very healthy diet. Alough I am now considering just going on a course of AAS as this has went on for 5 months now and I can't deal with it at all, going to go insane.\n\n",

    "title": "TPOab Ranges from 3,000 - 6,000",
    "content": "Dear Medical Community =)  I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's several years ago. My TPOab was near 6,000.  TSH was in the range that would be considered normal for normal people. I have been taking medication since 2003. My labs have not come back normal once yet.  I still feel like absolute garbage. I hurt all the time. I'm tired all the time. My bones ache and I can't hold information in my head long enough to do basic calculations. Finally, my hair is falling out and my skin has erupted with a vengence, amongst a variety of other symptoms that I don't have the energy to repeat here.  I have attempted to examine these problems from just about every possible medical perspective. I have seen professionals in each of the following fields: general medicine, infectious disease, endocrinology, neurology, rheumatology, gynecology, and dermatology. So far, the only answer they have really offered is that I have Hashimoto's (and an ovarian cyst). Needless to say, that really doesn't help much...  When I ask about why my thryoid antibodies are SO high, I am told, \"We don't treat for antibodies, we treat for TSH.\" While I understand that this is a skillful, but not incorrect evasion of the question =), and while I understand that this is what a large majority of the literature states, I have an absolute need to throw my question out there in the hope of finding SOMEONE who may have, in the course of his or her career, run across SOME obscure study addressing this question definitively or otherwise.  Antibodies are typically made by the body in response to invasive pathogens or in response to inflammatory disease processes, correct? If antibody titres are diagnostically useful in identifying and measuring immune responses to pathogens and inflammatory conditions, (rheumatoid arthritis, for example) then why is it not considered clinically significant in Hashimoto's thryoiditis? Is there a specific reason why A is true in situation 1 and not true in situation 2?  I understand that we can't assume that what is true in one situation can be generalized to suit all situations; yet, it seems this is a question which, in comparison to the more visibly disabling diseases, hasn't been very well studied.  Is there ANYONE out there who can tell me:  (1) Why my antibodies are SO high compared to the average Hashi patient. (2) Why the levels haven't fallen in response to the medication. (3) Why antibodies are considered the cornerstone of diagnosis for this disease, but then are not considered clinically significant in evaluating the progression of this disease. (4) What I should do the next time a doctor tells me that the bone pain is a result of depression =)  Any information you might have (or might have heard of) would be very helpful in directing my efforts to find a treatment that actually makes me feel better.  If anyone is up for a research project, or if you know of anyone who is looking for research subjects, I would truly appreciate the reference!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: TPOab Ranges from 3,000 - 6,000",
    "content": "Hello, Indeed antibodies are produced in most diseases in response to bacterial or other antigens.These can react with the antigen, and can be responsible for their elimination. However in autoimmune disorders like Hashimoto's the antibody is directed to our own tissue and thus are known as auto-antibodies.These only represent the body's altered response and may not always represent the degree of the disease.For example transplacental passage of TPO antibodies do not cause disease in the infant. Although Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Hashimoto\u2019s disease are autoimmune disorders, there are fundamental differences between them. Like in most autoimmune disorders, there are multiple autoantibodies involved in the case of RA. Although they manifest as synovitis of multiple joints initially, they have actions systemically, affecting various systems as the disease progresses. In contrast, in Hashimoto\u2019s, the thyroid peroxidase antibody is specific only for the throid follicular cells. It causes destruction of the follicles little by little until all the thyroid follicles are destroyed. \u201cTreatment\u201d of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis does not imply that one is treating the autoimmune disorder but, is only to replace the progressively declining thyroid hormone production. Even after all the thyroid follicles are destroyed, the antibodies are known to remain high in some individuals for variable lengths of time. But the good news is that they have no target cells anymore to attack. They are of little or no consequence as far as the rest of the body is concerned. At what point, all the follicles are destroyed in an individual case is open to speculation. Some have postulated that the decreases in TSH levels brought about by the thyroxin therapy may reduce the autoantigenic properties of the thyrocytes with a subsequent decrease in autoantibody titres.

Actually I was losing a lot of weight during the acute phase but now it's the complete opposit I'm gaining weight, although, I'm not hypothyroid and I don't have any symptoms of hypothyroidism. (My TSH is still below the normal range, whereas my T4 and T3 hormones are within the normal range)  My questions are:  is it normal to have a cyst during the subacute thyroiditis?  And, is it normal to stay hyperthyroid all this time after the onset of the disease?  Do we recover completely from this kind of thyroiditis or not?  Thank you for reading me.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: De Quervain thyroiditis.",
    "content": "Hi, There is no particular reason for cysts to occur in De Quervain's thyroiditis. Disruption of the follicles and hyperemia are the predominant microscopic features of this disease. Rather, it may be fair to say that De Quervain's thyroiditis can occur in thyroid glands with pre-existing cysts. In other words, they may be just incidental findings.  Thyroid nodules are common and are found by clinical palpation in 4-7% of the population and in up to 30-50% in autopsy studies. Approximately 5-10% of the clinically palpable nodules have been shown to be thyroid carcinoma.   Cysts in the thyroid gland can be - pure thyroid cysts, or - Complex cysts (cysts with variable amounts of solid component).   'Complex' cysts account for about 30% of thyroid nodules found on sonography, and pure thyroid cysts comprise < 1%. Most solitary thyroid cysts are derived from hyperplastic nodules and are believed to be a result of cystic change or hemorrhage in pre-existing nodules. Pure cysts are associated with a lower probability of malignancy than mixed cysts.  De Quervain's thyroiditis generally passes through four phases; Hyperthyroid---euthyroid---hypothyroid---- and finally euthyroid. Nearly 90% of patients with this condition recover completely. A minority (5-10%) may remain hypothyroid needing thyroxin replacement. Good luck!\n\n",

It was recommended that I continue to take my 200mcg of levothyroxine as usual, rest, and I should see improvement soon.  Should I seek a second opinion or medical attention to investigate my risk for myxedema coma?  At what point (if ever) is it recommended for someone with severe hypothyroidism to seek immediate medical attention?  I have recently received the following lab/exam results:  TSH >50 --I think it was 54? (normally kept very supressed at below 0.1),  T4 <.01, (normally kept on the high end of normal) T3 <.01, (normally kept on the high end of normal) slightly anemic All other CBC readings=normal (white count=normal) All autoimmune tests=negative lymes=negative urine=normal No abnormalities in chest xray slightly elevated BP  I am suffering from the following symptoms:  extreme fatigue low temperature(95-96 F),  periodic feverish spikes paired with dizziness and nausea severe joint pain muscle tension (too tense to shrug shoulders) enlarged lymph nodes behind ears and in the back of neck slight weight gain brittle nails cold sensitivity limbs falling asleep more frequently that usual headaches (near temples) occasional heart fluttering --not frequent VERY lethargic and fatigued insomnia (6 hours of sleep total in past 4 days) decreased appetite indigestion/acid reflux/belching constipation jaw tension  Medical history: Hashimoto's Papillary thyroid carcinoma ADD (hereditary) Endometriosis (diagnosed via laparoscopy) Generalized anxiety/depression *recently recovered from a MRSA infection  Current medications: 200 mcg Levothyroxine (1x daily, taken on empty stomach 1hr before other meds) Birth control pill 50 mg Vyvanse (1x daily, taken after breakfast) 10 mg Zyrtec (1x daily, taken after breakfast) Zyrtec-D (1x daily, taken after breakfast) 37.5 mg Paxil (1x daily, taken after breakfast) *decolonization treatment for MRSA -- hepaclens wash & bactroban swab in nose 2x/day  Social/Lifestyle: 21 y/o Female Single Heterosexual - 1 partner - no risk factors No tobacco use or past use Mild - Moderate alcohol consumption No past or present drug use Live alone Student\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Am I at risk for myxedema coma?",
    "content": "Hi, Myxedema coma occurs almost exclusively in persons 60 years and older and in individuals with long-standing hypothyroidism.You have indicated that you had undergone a total thyroidectomy in 2005. Occurs more often during the winter months, which suggests that significant environmental factors such as low temperatures may precipitate decompensation of an underlying compensated hypothyroidism.  None of the signs and symptoms of classic myxedema coma may be present in every case and are non specific. Profound 'coma' is not usual.  As you seem to be living alone, it may not be possible for others to notice anything unusual in you.Therefore you need to be extra-cautious.  You say that your 'endo' monitors you very closely, but you have not indicated what advise you were given following this last report. TSH over 50 mU/L is too high. Have you been taking your thyroid medications regularly??  Remember that hypothermia is defined as core temperatures  < 35\u00baC. Oral or axillary temperatures are unreliable. Low reading rectal thermometers are reliable and may help to alert you. Hypothermia may be classified as,    Mild hypothermia - Core temperature 32 to 35\u00baC (90 to 95\u00baF) Moderate hypothermia - Core temperature 28 to 32\u00baC (82 to 90\u00baF) Severe hypothermia - Core temperature below 28\u00baC (82\u00baF).  Patients with myxedema coma have a temperature below 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F) in approximately 15% of cases. 15% of patients may have a temperatures < 29.5\u00b0C (85\u00b0F).    Whenever there is any doubt about a change in mental status, formal mental status testing should be performed. It is recommended that physicians should also be alert to the possibility of depression in the seemingly demented patient and perform depression screening in any patient with mental status changes.  Therefore, it is better for you to get periodically followed up by one regular doctor who is familiar with your baseline mental status (to obviate confusions arising in case of an unforeseen emergency).You should consult your 'endo' as soon as you can with the latest report. In future, take your thyroid medications regularly and work with your doctor to keep your TSH at a satisfactory level. Non compliance will certainly put you at risk of myxedema coma. A review by your psychiatrist also will be immensely helpful.    Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a healthy 21 year old male, a little overweight (205 lb.), 6'0\" tall, and have never been on any medications or had any medical conditions. I have tried extensively to lose some weight to obtain a weight of about 180 for almost a year and have not been able to. While on my exercise routine, I would do cardiovascular exercises for 30-45 min on my lowest heart rate (about 129-130) and lift light weights about 12-15 reps for 3-4 sets. I was browsing the internet and came across a natural herbal supplement which is extracted from Tribulus Terristris, called Tristan. After doing extensive research, I found no side effects known, only positive results. I was wondering whether I should take this supplement along with continuing my proper diet and exercises, and if it would cause any hormonal imbalances, especially hypogonadism and sterility.   Thank you.\n\n",

Though it is not proved beyond doubt, this is said to be associated with increased incidence of atherosclerosis,deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.Greater than 100 micromoles is considered severe in blood samples.This aminoacid is broken down with the help of vitamins like B12 ,B6,And folic acid.If there is deficiency of these vitamins,when corrected would lower the levels.Genetic forms do occur but rare.

    "content": "Hi ohaedo, Your blood indices indicate a macrocytosis and your RBC count is low. As Dr.Jagesh has alluded to, Vitamin B12 deficiency must be excluded (and corrected promptly if present), as your serum homocystine levels are raised.   Your profile indicates that your mother has a schizoaffective disorder (which has a genetic background). Therefore, it becomes all the more important for you to avoid vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies. Discuss with your doctor and have your vitamin B12 and folic acid levels checked soon. Good luck!\n\n",

Since cutting out dairy I have become vegetarian also, and I have been warned by vegans etc about factory farmed foods, growth hormone and antibiotics fed to cows, etc.  What is your take on the situation?  Can you explain how estrogens (or other hormones) relate to food?  What food contains estrogens, is the amount enough to have an affect on our health?  Do you believe that unknowingly-consumed hormones have adversely affected Americans as a whole?  I have endocrine problems / hormone problems that are very complicated (I will post a different question for that), and I just get so confused about what I should be focusing on when choosing foods to eat on a daily basis.\n\n",

    "content": "My spouse is a 26 year old (male).  Since the age of 12 or 13 he has had increasing problems with what we have come to call \"hot face\".  At any time, for no reason we can determine, his face will become overly flushed, burning, and on terrible days will sweat profusely.  The heat is centered high on his cheeks, around his nose and sinus areas.  It can be certain foods (which changes all the time), high or low stress, in or out of public, warm or cold weather.  The only definite time we have found it to be the worst is when he is coming down with a cold, but that does not at all explain the times he is feeling perfectly healthy.  He is just over 6'1\" tall, very fair skin and burns easily in the sun, and is not overweight.  As a child they first said he would grow out of it.  He was then treated with allergy injections weekly which had noeffect.  He has had a mild tinea infection which we have been treating.  It flares in heat but there is no correlation to his \"hot face\".  He does have asthma and in the last year has been on Advair twice daily.  We have had some luck with GABA and primrose as herbals but they are no longer effective in reducing the hotface.  In the last year, dark purple striae have appeared on his upper inner thighs.  He will no longer go out in public for fear of thing flaring up, and has a hard time eating not knowing when he will be in intolerable discomfort.  He spends many evenings and days with cold-packs or ice on his face for relief.  We have thought of hyperhydrosis, Cushings, allergy, social anxiety, etc and are lost as to what may be causing his issue.  I hope there may be some insight or help for him.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 21 year old female. 5'8\" 140 lbs. I constantly feel weak, tired and just like I'm running on E. Sometimes if I stand up and still for extended amounts of time (and by extended this could be waiting 10 minutes in a long line or taking a 30minute shower) I find myself getting dizzy and lightheaded. When this happens I usually have about 5 minutes post the onset of those feelings to take a seat or else I really start to blackout. Two weeks ago however, I was getting some lunch and waiting in a long line. The lightheaded feeling popped up out of no where (I felt pretty good before that, not even hungry but it was time to eat). After getting the feeling I was unconscious in less than one minute. I was only out for a few seconds and started feeling better immediately. People around me helped until the paramedics came. Someone had me eat a bite of cookie while I waited. Once the paramedics arrived they took my sugar and it was 60 which they said was below normal and gave me a coke. 15 minutes later it was 79 and they let me go. I felt better. I had eaten 3-4 hours earlier (some rice and shrimp, water). I've been feeling especially weak ever since and it seems sort of independent of whether or not I eat (eating helps if it's like a serious meal, snacks and small meals do little). I've made sure to include proteins and whole grains in my meals. Other information:  I was vegetarian for 2.5 years, carefully watching my eating habits and getting a good range of proteins and vegetables (I ate dairy and eggs).  I have recently incorporated fish and seafood back into my diet wondering if that might help me be more energetic (although this has been an on and off problem for much of my life, including when I ate all kinds of meat).  I was tested for iron deficiency about 1.5 years ago and was found to be slightly anemic but the follow up testing a year later said I was fine and I was taken off iron supplements (I cant say that I felt any different while taking the supplements).  I like to be active. I play a varsity sport at my college but this problem makes it difficult to walk around, let alone run and sprint. The problem is on and off but has recently been quite bothersome. I have made a doctor's appointment.\n\n",

    "content": "Good Day,  I am a 36 year old male suffering from anxiety (GAD).  Up until 9 months ago I had no idea what GAD actually meant and anxiety was just for nervous people.  I now know that this condition is very real and can be quite debilitating.  My concern is that I believe my testosterone levels or lack there of are driving the anxiety.  I will give you a bit of a time line of events leading up to my diagnosis of GAD.  3 years old- corrective surgery for undescended testes.(successful on right side) 8 years old- corrective surgery for left side undescended teste.(not successful) 13 years old- put on a hormone therapy to help coerce puberty with one immature teste. 16 years old- left side orchiectomy and insertion of prosthetic teste. Married at 28 found to be infertile at 30. 36 years old- testosterone levels found to be damn near non existant. 36 years old- right side orchiectomy and insertion of prosthetic teste. (due to microlithiasis) 36 years old- put on hormone replacement therapy indefinetly  I had a panic attack in October of 2009 and (never had one before) thought I was having the big one (family history of heart attacks) rushed to emergency plugged into all the machines, ecg comes back just fine, everything settles down and I am released.  Quite relieved but very concerned as to what had transpired.  I tried to continue my job (pilot) but found that I was getting a lot of anxiety every trip.  Arms tingling, eyes hyper focusing etc. and had to quit.  GP put me on Wellbutrin xl basically at the same time as I began the Androgel regime.  Since being on Androgel, my libido has hugely increased, more muscle tone, hair growth etc.  I feel really good, in fact better than ever.  My question is this, could a lifetime of likely having very low testosterone levels be blamed for my anxiety issues? Are there other tests I should insist upon getting done?  I would inevitably love to get off of the Wellbutrin.   I appreciate your time and assistance!\n\n",

    "title": "hyperthyroidsm/vitamin D deficiency",
    "content": "I\u2019m 24 now. I had my baby in 2007. After having the baby I was depressed like for a week what I think the so called postpartum depression. Well that went away but my tiredness didn\u2019t I was sleepy all the time. In May 2009 I felt a groin in my throat I was going through some stress but it went away by itself after a month. In August 14, 2009 I had a surgery done a bilateral removal of breast lumps, 1 in my right and 2 in my left. I fainted right after the surgery when the nurses put me to walk so I could of go home, they didn\u2019t do any test as of whey I fainted, I went home after that cause I didn\u2019t faint again. After a week of the surgery I started to get depressed I was dizzy I was sleeping almost all day and night I wasn\u2019t eating properly, I didn\u2019t have interest in anything. Mid August I went to Tijuana, MX. And decided to get a thyroid test well it came out that I was hyperthyroidism. My groin came back it was bothering me in my throat.  I started on medication by the end of August I don\u2019t remember the name but I was on 5mg 3 times a day. I decided to see a doctor here in California for that so I could of get medication from a local pharmacy. I went to a new doctor in January 2010 he did another test and change my medication told me to continue taking it and get rechecked in 3 weeks. I got rechecked and my levels were normal he told me to continue taking it and go back in 2 weeks so I did my level were low he told me to take only 5mg a day, and get rechecked in 2 weeks so I did, my levels were still low, he told me to discontinue the medication so I did, this was like in March 2010 and get rechecked in 4 weeks I did I my levels were normal. My throat groin went away. I got another test in May and June 2010 and it came out normal, I got a vitamin test done also and it came out that my vitamin D is low so I take 1,000 units daily.   When I was a kid I suffered from parasites I don\u2019t know the English word but in Spanish is amibas, they were going up my brain so they were making me fain, I wasn\u2019t eating, until I got a stool test in mexico and came out I had parasites I got treated for it and I recovered.  Now I have been feeling really bad everyday in the morning and afternoon I tend to get nervous without any cause my hands get shaky, I get dizzy like my body acting on its own that moving in its own. I feel like if I\u2019m going to faint since I know how it feels to faint, I feel lightheaded. I feel weakness in my upper legs no strength. And once in a while I start feeling a heartbeat underneath my throat. It feels strong.   My point is now I don\u2019t know what is causing me this problems if its my thyroids not acting right if I should get them rechecked or if there\u2019s another test I should do. Or if I still have parasites I had a stool test back in march it came out I had parasites I took med PARAMIX for 3 days I got another test in July it came out negative, but maybe there\u2019s a blood test to check for parasites. Or I don\u2019t know if its my deficiency of Vitamin D, causing me this problems.  Please help I don\u2019t like this symptoms I want to feel like before. Thank you,\n\n",

    "title": "Re: hyperthyroidsm/vitamin D deficiency",
    "content": "Hi, Your symptoms are too non specific to attribute to any particular diagnosis. The one thing that appears certain is that you seem to be suffering from repeated intestinal parasitic infection. Although you had tested positive for amebiasis on more than one occasion since childhood, other helminthic infestations also must be sought. In chronic cases, often there is a paucity of symptoms.There is some evidence that thyroid status influences metabolism of vitamin D. Some workers recommend vitamin D supplementation in both hyper as well as hypothyroid states.  It is well known that chronic amebiasis and especially giardiasis in children often cause malabsorbtion and stunted growth.  Several years prior to the AIDS epidemic, many gay men became infected by intestinal parasites which previously had occurred mostly in the tropics. These diseases, notably amebiasis and giardiasis, started to spread via sexual transmission, to infect as many as 60% of gay men. Once infected, persons can carry the parasites for years unless they detected and treated. Many gay men show only minimal symptoms or none at all and can infect others.   These parasites are believed to act as \"cofactors\" which do not cause AIDS, but may make it more likely that exposure to the HIV infection will develop into the disease. Some experts believe that the continuing epidemic of parasites among gay men has been a cofactor for AIDS and a major factor responsible for its spread.Fortunately, the sexually transmitted amebiasis is less virulent than the strains found in the tropics, and respond to milder drugs, such as humatin (paromomycin).  There is reasonable body of evidence indicating that helminthiasis is also responsible for the unrelenting prevalence of AIDS and tuberculosis in developing, particularly African, countries. A review of data from several studies clearly indicates that effective treatment of helminth infection reduces HIV progression by decreasing the viral load, thus improving helminth-induced immune suppression.  It is at times overlooked that treatment of the whole family is ideal in treating intestinal helminthic infestations. As sexually transmitted amebisis and giardiasis have become a reality, it may also be beneficial to investigate and treat the sexual partners as well for achieving better cure rates. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi There,  My name is Amanda, I am a 28 year old female currently in my 8th week of my  4th pregnancy with 2 live children and 1 miscarriage recently. During my miscarriage, my tsh rose to 3.49 before my doctor increased my Synthroid dosage from 50mcg to 75mcg. Following the miscarriage, my tsh dropped all the way to 0.03 where it was when I got pregnant again. My dr. had me decrease my Synthroid dosage back to 50mcg daily. In less than 2 weeks, my tsh went from 0.03 to 0.54. I then upped my dosage to 50mcg for two days and then 75mcg on the third day. 19 days later, my tsh is at 2.73 and I am concerned with how rapidly it is rising. I am feeling very hypo again. My dr, unfortunately thinks that this is still normal, but I'm concerned with both the rate it is rising and the level it is at. I want to increase my dosage again, but she isn't convinced. I live in Canada and am seeing a family practitioner who refuses to refer me to an endocrinologist because she feels my tsh is within the normal range. I am working hard on a referral, but don't want to ignore my rising tsh in the meantime.   I know that progressive testing with T3 and T4 would be the most helpful in order to come to a firm conclusion, but unfortunately my dr. won't do this testing as she feels TSH is a good enough gauge so I don't have those numbers for you.  Should I increase my dose? If so, what would you consider a reasonable increase that will likely lower my tsh to within the 1-2 range? And, is my tsh level of 2.73 dangerous as far as the pregnancy goes? I really don't want to have another miscarriage. I have had one ultrasound already a week ago with a strong heartbeat if that helps at all.  Thank-you so much for your help.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pregnant, hypothyroid, rapidly rising tsh, dose question",
    "content": "Hi, It is not advisable to try and correct the TSH levels in pregnancy without knowledge about the FT4 levels. TSH levels take time to change following dosage adjustments of thyroxin, and harm may be done to the growing fetus in the interim.   Both maternal hypo and hyperthyroidism are not good for the fetus as well as the mother but, between them, hyperthyroidism perhaps is more harmful from the point of view of the fetus. Therefore, rather than to risk pushing oneself into a hyperthyroid state, it is imperative that any changes in thyroxin dosage during pregnancy, should only be guided only by FT4 levels. Good luck!\n\n",

After checking that my erectile dysfunction is not caused by any psychological issue, neither by any physiological problem (blood circulation in veins,...), I took an hormonal analysis:   TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone): 2,32 uUI/ml T3 (triiodothyronine): 0,94 ng/ml T4 (thyroxine): 6,95 ug/dl 17 Beta Estradiol: 42.2 pg/ml Testosterone: 724 ng/dl Free Testosterona: 17.8 pg/ml DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone): 11.3 ng/ml FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone): 1.65 mUI/ml LH (Luteinizing hormone): 2.42 mUI/ml Prolactin: 12.32 ng/ml  The doctor says it's ok, but I think the Estradiol is too high and this might be the cause of my problems.

    "content": "Hello - I've been experiencing this issue off and on for several years and have had glucose level testing done which has always come back normal.  However, during my last pregnancy, I failed the glucose tolerance test by a small amount (can't remember the actual numbers at this point since it's been 12 years or so!).  My thyroid was removed and I've been taking 12.5 mcg of liothyronine and 1.0 mg of levothyroxine daily for years, with TSH in low-normal range and T3/T4 levels stable.  Typically, the scenario has been that I'd eat a meal and within 10-15 minutes, I'd be unable to stay awake, feeling a slight nausea and an overwhelming need to sleep.  If I tried to fight it, I would just feel sicker and sicker, then I'd fall asleep.  The sleep is deep.  I'd almost equate it to general anaesthesia where you are there and then you're not.  The sleep seems to last about an hour or sometimes more.  If I am roused during the sleep, I wake feeling groggy, with a headache, fogged thinking, feeling completely drained of energy and an undercurrent of nausea.  It reminds me of the few college-aged hangovers I had.  That feeling is difficult to overcome, sometimes for hours.  I altered my diet somewhat and the symptoms went away.  However, I've returned to less careful eating and I've experienced the \"crash\" again.  What troubles me more is that the most recent events have occurred without the typical meal first.  In the past month, I believe I've had this occur at least four times without having had a meal, usually in the mid-afternoon 3-4PM, long after lunch and before supper.  I know my PCP will be happy to try more bloodwork but it's been normal forever and he doesn't especially dig around and look for alternatives once the bloodwork shows up alright.  If I can have some additional possible insights, I know he'd pursue them with me.  Thank you for any suggestions!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, In the not so distant past, elevated TSH and Antithyroid microsomal antibodies (TMAb) were considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis. despite the presence of contaminating antigens in the preparations. Thyroid peroxidase (TPO), a large, membrane-associated glycoprotein expressed only in the thyrocytes, is an important enzyme involved in the multistep thyroid hormone synthesis. It is the major autoantigen in the thyroid microsomal particle. Assays for Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) are now available and this has rendered TMAb obsolete.  Antithyroid microsomal antibodies in titers greater than 1:6,400 are strongly suggestive of chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis or Graves disease (GD). TPOAb in excess of 200 IU per mL, strongly suggests Hashimoto's thyroiditis. 57-74% of patients with Graves' disease also show high values.   TMAb titers >1:100 are found in 10-13% of elderly women (mean age 80 years)and 3% of elderly men, but titers >1:6400 are present in only 1% of normal individuals.  Detection of TPOAb is strong evidence against a goiter being due to non-autoimmune causes of hypothyroidism. The risk for the development of hypothyroidism is 3% to 4% per year if TPOAb are present and TSH is elevated.   By the way, do you have a goiter? You should get your TPOAb levels checked, to be sure.

Although your post gives a detailed account of your distressing symptoms(understandably), there is unfortunately a paucity of detail regarding the past history (for example, was the thyroid storm precipitated by thyroidectomy or some other event, when exactly the surgery was performed, how much of thyroxin you are on, what are the results of the recent thyroid function tests etc).Without these details, unfortunately, not much of an opinion can be offered.

    "title": "Re: potassium levels",
    "content": "Hi, It is not clear how it came to be known that your intracellular Potassium(K+) levels are low. These are not measured routinely. Are your renal functions OK?. What about other serum electrolytes (esp, bicarbonate)?  What is the blood pH? What is the serum osmolality?  Most of the total body K+ is intracellular. This pool acts as a buffer to prevent sudden, wide fluctuations of the serum levels which can have deleterious effects on the heart. Intracellular shift of the serum K+ and renal excretion of potassium under aldosterone influence are the chief ways the body gets rid of excess serum K+. This mechanism is well developed in humans. However, there is no well developed renal mechanism for conservation of K+.    Normal adult values for serum K+ range from 3.5 to 5.5 mmol/L. Serum K+ concentrations may not be an accurate indicator of total body stores, as intracellular K+ accounts for 98% of total body amount.Serum K+ levels below 3.5 and above 5.5 mmol/L have traditionally been labeled as hypokalemia and hyperkalemia, respectively.Serum K+  above 6.5 mEq/L is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and should be handled as an emergency.  In routine clinical situations, whenever high values for serum K+ are encountered, the technique of blood specimen collection needs to be first looked into. 'Pseudohyperkalemia' is an in vitro phenomenon (i.e., the in vivo serum K+ is normal). This is caused by the release of K+ from cellular elements of blood during the process of clotting and, less commonly, by the release of K+ from ischemic muscle cells due to tight tourniquet or hand/arm exercise during the procedure. If the latter is suspected, blood should be drawn in a proper manner again and serum K+ repeated. If the former is suspected, the platelet and white cell counts should be checked, and serum should be inspected for significant hemolysis (hemolized sample). Hyperkalemia occurs when there is thrombocytosis (platelet count greater than 600,000), leukocytosis (WBC greater than 200,000) or significant hemolysis (serum hemoglobin greater than 1.5 g/dl). In cases of pseudohyperkalemia, the plasma K+ (unclotted blood), as opposed to serum K+, will be normal.  Hemolysis may occur during sample collection due to, - rapid aspiration of blood through a narrow-gauge needle,and - excessive agitation of blood samples.  To prevent false results, phlebotomy personnel should not rapidly aspirate blood through a narrow-gauge needle or excessively agitate blood samples.   Hyperkalemia associated with normal total body K+ is caused by the shifts of K+ out of the cell and is commonly seen in acidemia, sudden increases in plasma osmolality, massive tissue breakdown and, in very rare circumstances, adrenergic blockade and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis.  Gordon's syndrome or Familial hyperkalemia and hypertension (FHH; pseudohypoaldosteronism type II) is an autosomal dominant disorder featuring hyperkalemia, hypertension, and low renin. Hypercalciuria accompanies hyperkalemia, and both precede hypertension. The mean time between detection of hyperkalemia and appearance of hypertension was seen to be 13 yrs in some studies.  Several HIV-1 proteins have been shown to perturb membrane permeability and ion transport. Unexplained hyperkalemia persisting despite normal cortisol response to ACTH may represent hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, which has been described in hospitalized patients with HIV disease. Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism may occur with several other conditions as well.  Chewing tobacco contains a significant amount of potassium. A case of severe hyperkalemia in a patient undergoing chronic hemodialysis due to tobacco chewing has been reported.  [Fan K, Leehey DJ. Orange juice-induced hyperkalemia in a diabetic patient with chronic renal failure. Diabetes Care. 1996 Dec;19(12):1457-8].  Without much by way of history to go by and with lack of details regarding other laboratory tests, i can't be more specific. As you indicate that you had meningitis in the recent past (2008), you need to have your serum osmolality checked. You may consider discussing with your doctor about being referred to a neurologist for a consultation. I hope this information is of help. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Just had thyroidectomy, how long til Hypothyroidizm?",
    "content": "Hi, You have not indicated if radioactive iodine ablation (to destroy the thyroid remnant, if any) has been planned.  For effective radioiodine ablation, it is necessary to obtain high iodine uptake levels by the thyroid remnant after surgery. To achieve this, the thyroid hormone suppression therapy (THST) must not be started immediatly after surgery. The delay in initiation of the thyroid hormone therapy after the total thyroidectomy brings about the progressive increase of the Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)  serum levels. Maximal TSH stimulation is necessary to ensure that any remnant of thyroid gland will avidly take up the radioiodine and thus get destroyed in the process. The half-life of T4 is 5-7 days; the half-life of T3 is only 1 day. Most investigators consider that serum TSH levels needed to obtain this stimulus of the thyroid tissue is typically achieved in 4 to 6 weeks(TSH levels higher than 25-30 mUI/l).  The main problem with this approach is that the hypothyroid symptoms that the patients develop is often too distressing. A newer approach tries to overcome this problem in a way that patients can be started on (or continue) thyroxin therapy and still undergo thyroid ablation with radioiodine. This has become possible with the introduction of  Recombinant human TSH (rhTSH).    Thyrotropin alfa was initially approved in the US in 1998 and Europe in 2001 for use as a diagnostic tool in the management of patients being tested for the recurrence of well-differentiated thyroid cancer.  In December 2007, the US Federal Drug Administration(FDA) approved the use of rhTSH for adjuvant treatment with radioiodine in patients with differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC) without evidence of metastasis.  Recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) has been found to be an effective and safe alternative to thyroid hormone withdrawal during the post-surgical management of papillary and follicular thyroid cancer.  You may discuss with your surgeon as to whether this alternative modality is suitable for you and also the expenses involved. rhTSH is fairly expensive and some insurance plans may not cover this treatment. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am 22 yrs old and have had acne since puberty. My periods were at one stage erratic and I used to feel terribly tired after meals.I then consulted a professional naturopathist (about 3 yrs ago).A hormone test indicated that my hormones were not out of range..but i was given chaste tree, progesterone cream,tablets to regulate my insulin levels,and various other powders for 2 months. This regulated my periods and they\u2019ve been fairly regular ever since ( i.e for the last 2 years). And I have no tiredness after meals irrespective of how heavy they are. Yet i still get the acne and hair. I had an ultra sound 6 months ago which showed cysts and enlarged ovaries. Though i have not missed or been late on a single period since 2007! This is the first time i heard of pcos. My pp glucose and insulin are within range. I have seen various doctors and have read up so extensively that it is almost an obsession.I notice that during the follicular phase, my skin is fairly clear and then i get break outs during the luteal phase after supposed 'ovulation'. I also noticed that eating phytoestrogenic foods like sesame seeds and chick peas etc clear my skin radically, but when i eat it too frequently, i get more break outs. I am so confused. I was told to just manage my pcos by my doctors till getting pregnant becomes necessary. I am lean,a vegetarian since birth and incredibly healthy, even consciously trying to avoid heating food in plastics, xenoestrogens etc. A recent hormone test on the 3rd day of my cycle shows my LH/ FSH to be 6.36/3.71 MIL/ml receptively. My total testosterone was normal, though my SHBG was slightly higher than the normal range.My 12-OH progesterone was 2.6nmol/L. I don\u2019t seem the typical candidate for pcos as i am thin,very healthy with normal insulin levels yet i still have symptoms such as cysts, acne and slightly more hair on my face,chin and stomach and lower back. I am fairly learned in anatomy , so could you please explain in terms of hormone levels and events in my body, why u think i have a higher LH/FSH ratio, and why i still get cysts if i have regular periods. How can i have a regular cycle and still not ovulate? And what may be the cause of my cysts other than  insulin resistance. Is there any way to manage insulin resistance if I already have a low GI diet?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, No, this would not inhibit or delay your growth.  Anemia can be checked easily so if you believe your fatigue may be caused by this, have it tested.  In the meantime it can't hurt to eat foods that are high in iron such as whole grains, meats, egg yolks, dark veggies and beans, apricots and raisins.    The amounts of blood taken for testing - even multiple vials - does not amount to enough to cause anemia.  Your stature has a lot to do with your genetic makeup so if your parents are short, you may be as well.  There is not much you can do to change that.  Also, the onset of your periods often results in no further height growth.  Puberty age and growth varies with the individual.  You might schedule a well child exam with your doctor to review your growth patterns, puberty and family health history.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I recently visited my primary doctor and told her that for the past ten months I have had little to no peiords.  Around the beginning of 2010 I was experiencing bad mood swings, almost incontrollable anger.  At that point, I had switched my birth control from Levora to Yaz, my doctor explaining that it had the least amount of estrogen.  For a while I seemed better, although I have had vaginal dryness and little to no libido for the entire 10 months.  At the beginning of the summer I began to feel the bad mood swings again as well as depression (equal to the days of my raging hormone teenage years) and could not understand what is wrong with me besides an unequatable amount of stress.  Bloodwork showed normal FSH, LH, & TSH levels.  These have all stayed normal with test dates of 4/31/2009, 8/10/10 & 8/18/10.  However, my estadiol level went from 69.9 on 4/31/09 to 9.0 on 8/10/10 and 12.0 on 8/18/10.  My prolactin levels were 9.94 on 4/31/09 to 26.58 on 8/10/10 and 25.82 on 8/18/10.  Even though the prolactin levels are borderline, I feel that something is definitely amiss.  I have noticed that my nails are quite brittle and my triglyceride levels are twice the norm in the 250's.  I am 26 and eat well and exercise regularly.  My doctor tells me that even though my e2 levels are in the menopause range, the LH and FSH levels do not reflect a premenopausal woman.  I have to wait for awhile to get in with an endo and am very anxious in the meantime to know what the possibilities could be. My research has pointed to a prolactinoma, but my boss (a neurosurgeon) tells me that my prolactin would be in the 100's.  I didn't know if being on Yaz was somehow keeping my hormone levels at a more normal level though.    ANY information you can give me would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

Non autoimmune causes of B12 deficiency also may be associated in hypothyroid patients and this association has not been studied in detail and may vary according to dietary habits in different populations.Some of the symptoms (weakness, numbness,paraesthesia, and poor memory) can occur in both hypothyroidism and vitamin B12 deficiency. Anaemia with or without macrocytosis, tends to occur later in B12 deficiency and may even be absent.In one study, a significant symptomatic improvement was observed within 3-6 months of initiating B12 treatment in hypothyroid individuals with low B12 levels.  Hashimoto's thyroiditis: Management of patients with overt hypo-thyroidism is straight forward.  In patients with an elevated TSH level and a normal thyroxine (T4) level (subclinical hypothyroidism), indications for treatment are not very clear. If the TSH level is greater than 20 mU per mL (20 mU per L) with a normal T4 level, there is a high probability that the patient will develop hypothyroidism. If the TSH level is elevated but is less than 20 mU per mL and the antimicrosomal antibody titer is greater than 1:1,600, hypothyroidism is likely to develop in 80% of patients. Therefore, in patients with a serum TSH level greater than 10 mU per mL (10 mU per L) with symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, and in patients with a high risk of progression to hypothyroidism (e.g., those with high antibody titers) , it is recommended that treatment be initiated. As for the others, because of the risk of developing hypothyroidism, annual assessment of thyroid function is indicated. (Sakiyama R. Thyroiditis: a clinical review. Am Fam Physician 1993;48:615-21).  As your post lacks details, i can't be more specific.It may not be a bad idea, to have your vitamin B12 levels checked as well. I hope this information is of help. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I have a question concerning growth plates. I am 4'9 and my husband is 6'2. I have a 13 (almost 14) year old son whom I have taken to two different endocrologist. He is very short his current height is 5'. Both endocrologist said there is no hormone defiency so they will not do GH therapy. I recently took him to a bone & joint clinic for knee and elbow problems the dr. said his growth plates are \"closing\" I asked if that means he is finished growing he said not nessecilary. Well this news comes as a great concern to me! I know that when they close no further growth is possible. I aslo understand he is going to be short, but the endocronoligist said between 5'2 & 5'9. My question is how much more potential growth is possible once the plates satrt \"closing\"? Is it now too late for GH therapy? Isn't 13/14 a little early for this process to be staring? He is going thru  puberty hair under arms, voice change ect. I have an appt with the endocrologist in 3 weeks, thats the soonest I can get him in. I feel like every day is time passing that we may need! Please advise a very worried mother what to do. Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Growth plates \"closing\"",
    "content": "Hi, You say - (recently took him to a bone & joint clinic for knee and elbow problems the dr. said his growth plates are \"closing\").I presume that X-Rays of the elbow and knee were obtained and the doctor based his observation from these films.  It would have been very helpful if you had given the reason for his joint problem.  Hand bone age measurements are a commonly utilized modality for assessing skeletal maturity in children.  In the evaluation of the risk of curve progression in idiopathic scoliosis however(Because spine films are not sensitive enough to measure the progression of skeletal maturity during the rapid growth phase of adolescence),many orthopedic surgeons use radiographs of the elbow (method of Sauvegrain1).  Bone growth occurs at the epiphysial plate.Growth in height of an individual is a sum of the growth of the long bones in the lower limb,the bones of the vertebral column and the skull.  How much an individual is expected to grow in height per year can not be unfortunately predicted accurately by dividing the known 'average' increase in the height of a group of individuals at (say,25 years of age) by  number of years.  This is because bone growth (velocity of growth) is neither uniform, nor linear.Bones grow more rapidly during adolescence and thereafter, the velocity declines.  The examples sited below(observations from some studies) may be more informative...     \"Overall, approximately 70% of growth in the femur occurs at the distal growth plate. The proportion of growth occurring in the distal femoral growth plate in girls varies from 60% at seven years of age to 90% at age 14. Similarly, the contribution of the distal femoral growth plate in boys varies from 55% at seven years of age to 90% at age 16. Overall, the contribution of the proximal tibial growth plate is approximately 57%. In girls, this varies from 50% at seven years of age to 80% at age 14. In boys it varies from 50% at seven years of age to 80% at age 16\".   From the age of seven to skeletal maturity, the distal femur contributes approximately 1.3 cm per year to femoral growth, except in the last two years, when it contributes half that amount.  Another example: \"The long bones displayed decelerating growth through time, with greater velocities for the larger lower limb (vs. smaller upper limb) bones and the larger proximal (vs. smaller distal) elements within limbs. Coordination for bone size and growth velocity is good both within and between limbs, suggesting a common growth control mechanism that should make growth prediction possible. Adjusted for size, the tibia appears to be the most variable of these four long bones, which may be due to a combination of environmental effects and flexible growth potential\". Am. J. Hum. Biol. 16:648-657, 2004. \u00a9 2004  The aforesaid observations hopefully make it abundantly clear that growth in height of an individual is complex,various bones contributing varying proportions at varying times to the overall growth.  To conclude,it appears that in a given 'individual',it may be extremely difficult to accurately predict the final height he/she may achieve! Good day!\n\n",

    "title": "fatigue, migraines, joint pain, heart palp, no DX",
    "content": "For the past 3 years I have struggled to function in my job and personal life while dealing with nearly daily symptoms of extreme fatigue to the point I find myself planning activities that don't require physical exertion, but ironically with severe insomnia.   At least weekly I also have severe migraine type headaches that cause blurred vision in only one eye at a time, with a grey \"shadowy\" vision out of that eye, which causes nausea and light and sound sensitivity.  In addition to the fatigue, in the past 2-3 years, I have developed significant joint pain particularly in my knees, which worsens both when I attempt to exercise, as well as if I stay stationary for over 1 hour. I had begun yoga to attempt to strengthen my supporting muscles, but after 8 months of yoga, the only outcome is that now my knees seem to slide out of their joints at times, and now my left fingers have begun to show the same stiffness and searing pain.  Whether this is significant at all I'm not sure. But I am always insatiably thirsty. If I am on a long commute and realize I have forgotten my drinks, I must stop and buy up to 3-4 bottles of water or gatorade to last me 1-3 hours. Despite this, my urine is typically cloudy, and I have had 4 kidney stones in the past 2 years.  Because of the fatigue, sluggishness, mental fog, almost chronic yeast infections, inability to focus at times, and itchy dry skin, as well as the significant family history, my PCP has done 3 thyroid tests which are at worst on the low end of normal. So that has been ruled out.  I have been developing new symptoms in the past year such as daily nausea intermittently during the day EVERY day, \"thoracic outlet syndrome\", tingling and \"pins and needles\" feelings in my left hand, and an odd heart sensation. At least weekly, I have an odd experience that my heart is completely skipping a beat or two. This is followed my a deep hollow thump (felt and heard at times) and the feeling that all of the air has temporarily been sucked out of my lungs.  Additionally, I have been gaining weight. I started a diet of 1400-1600 calories per day, high in protiens, fiber, and fruit and veggies. After 7 months of this diet, along with exercise, I had only lost 5 pounds.  I am a mental health therapist, and am aware of how emotions can affect somatic symptoms. However, I am not experiencing panic attacks, anxiety, or depression, except for the frustration that I feel each time I go to a doctor only to hear them tell me I should be \"Happy\" that all the tests come back normal. Ironically, I'd rather have a diagnosis at this time than to have normal test results.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Thyroid levels increased substantially within 2 days of test",
    "content": "Hi, This query touches upon two important aspects related to thyroid function testing. - relationship of TSH levels to food intake and - timing of the testing.  Firstly, as far as T3 and T4 measurements are concerned, blood may be drawn at any time of the day without fasting. TSH levels also may be measured at any time of the 'day' without the need to fast.  Like other pitutary hormones(such as growth hormone) that show a circadian variation, TSH also shows a fairly consistent pattern of variations during a 24 hour period.  TSH appears to be secreted in a dual fashion, a) in intermittent  pulses(bursts) which constitute 60-70% of the total amount secreted and b) a background continuous apulsatile(tonic) secretion (30-40%). The pulses occur roughly every 2-3 hours(subject to variations). Occurrence of these spurts are difficult to pin point accurately.  Several studies indicate that the maximum TSH levels occurs just before a person falls asleep.The levels thereafter tend to maintain during the night, with mean values of 1.34 mu/ml.The serum TSH levels begin to fall the next morning from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.Thereafter, the level tends to remain low during the rest of the day (mean serum TSH value of 0.85 \u03bcU/ml). No relationship between meals and the variation of the TSH level has been noted. The circadian rhythm of serum TSH is not only of physiological interest but has also the practical implications in that, blood sample collections for TSH determinations are best performed at 11 a.m, when the TSH level has fallen to the average daytime levels.  Thus one can appreciate that although TSH,T3 and T4 may be performed at any time of the day and without fasting, there is a valid point in performing TSH testing during the forenoon hours.  You have unfortunately not included your laboratory's normal reference ranges.  Since late 2002, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) revised the normal range to 0.3-3.0 for serum TSH levels.Prior to 2002, the commonly used range was 0.5-5.0. As explained earlier, TSH levels must not be interpreted in isolation.  You have not mentioned at what time of the day (or night) your blood samples were drawn and whether both times the samples were collected at the same time of the day/night or otherwise. Also, you have not mentioned about having any complaints suggestive of hypothyroidism, i take it that you are perhaps don't have them.Your TSH levels were within normal reference range. But, some endocrinologists would prefer to treat patients with TSH levels >2 if the symptoms and clinical features are so compelling to suggest hypothyroidism. Best wishes!\n\n",

I know that something is off and have been trying to figure it out.  My aunt has thyroid cancer and her Thyroid blood tests came back perfectly normal.

    "content": "Hi, Hypothyroidism may be - primary (due to a throid disorder), - secondary (due to a pitutary disorder), or - tertiary (due to an hypothalamic disorder).  The secondary and tertiary types together are known as central hypothyroidism.   Your FT4 is closer to the lower limit of the normal range and the TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone), although within range, appears to be inappropriately low for the level of the FT4.This kind of a thyroid profile is seen in secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism.   To differentiate primary from tertiary hypothyroidism, a TRH(thyrotropin releasing hormone) stimulation test may at times help.In this test, the TSH response is studied following an injection of TRH. If there is absolutely no increase in TSH, it indicates secondary hypothyroidism. It there is a delayed and attenuated response (at at 60-180 minutes), this indicates a tertiary hypothyroidism. In primary hypothyroidism and normal controls, TSH rises in about 20-30 minutes.But this test is not a good discriminator in distinguishing between these conditions.  Measuring basal serum prolactin level may be more discriminatory (low or normal in secondary hypothyroidism and increased in tertiary hypothyroidism).However, there is one exception, and that is, if the pitutary destruction is due to a prolactinoma.  One simpler test, often overlooked, is to look for the nocturnal surge of TSH which is seen in normal persons(highest TSH values occur just before a person falls asleep at night).This surge will be absent in both secondary and tertiary hypothyroidism.This may be an easier way to identify central causes of hypothyroidism.   As many of your symptoms could be caused by a hypothyroid state, you need to be investigated promptly to search for possible causes of secondary or tertialry hypothyroidism.however, i suggest that it may not be a bad idea to have your thyroid profile repeated and if shows a similar pattern, then further investigations may be initiated. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "pituitary gland/hypothalymus",
    "content": "1997 was diagnosed with hashimoto's (hypothyroidism).  Gained 40 pounds from symptoms.    8 years later and about 30 more pounds I had major life changes (death of a parent, pet; put into a job that wasn't trained for until the company was bought and would lose job after 20 years with same company; under-financed with owning 2 homes - selling/buying disconnect; vehicle dieing; and that's about all I can think of, but I know there was more).  By 2006, I left my job because of the stress (180/120) while on tranquilizers; didn't make it to the lay off.  I was then put on BP meds and diagnosed with anxiety; by 2007 was on cholesterol meds.  I took 17 months off to try to recover from \"life\" and work on losing weight and getting healthy.  By the end of 2008 and at a new job, I had lost 75 pounds with dedication to right eating and exercising.    2009 and 2010 I went through changes of eating (eating minimums of 1,200 to as much as 1,700 on high protein) and changes of exercises to jump start my weight loss because I stopped losing weight.  I actually gained about 8 pounds over 2009/2010 that won't come off, despite these changes.  Everyone that knows me is amazed that what I put in doesn't come out... i.e. for all the right proper; quality, quantity eating I do and exercising that I do not see anything on the scale.  This past January I went to a trainer for help. He put me on a high protein diet, which I follow today that keeps me away from added sugars, corn syrup and is made up of fruit, veggies, whole grains, and of course the high protein, which I enjoy after my work outs.  The exercise portion was too strenuous for me as I went through a flood in my home for a month, hurt my leg, and lost my job.  I couldn't mentally or physically keep up the pace he wanted me on (increasing incline and speed on the treadmill every week for a month).  So I decided to release myself of it and go back to my own program.  I was working out twice a day 6 days a week... still nothing... Now I'm on the 8 weeks to running a 5K... I'm up to 2.25 miles 3 days a week and then doing cross training with weight resistance the other two days.  The weekends are left for walking and housework.  Through all of this, I weigh 175 pounds.  Myself, I cannot get over that here I am this obese person jogging on a treadmill and all the other dedicated people that show up at the gym DO NOT look like me at all.  It is very upsetting; I know I have stuck with this so long and haven't been rewarded.  Although I have weight everywhere, the bulk is the big stomach I have.  This is what stops me from looking average.  I have to constantly hide it in big shirts which probably make me look bigger.  If I don't it just hangs out there.    I am so disappointed, however it has never stopped me because I don't want to gain weight, but I am at a loss on what is next for me.  I had done some reading recently because I can't get this out of my head.  I finally decide that I'm going to go to the doctor for help and my healthcare has just run out.  I'm working on getting healthcare again.  So the reading I have done is about stress/cortisol and it's role in holding weight on the body where it has thrown the hypothalymus off it's axis.  Is there any truth to this that this could screw up my metabolism.  I can honestly say that I have been doing everything right, yet I only have gotten half way home.  I want it so bad to be as healthy as I possibly can.  Can anyone shed any light for me, please?  Female: 51 years Height:  5 Foot Weight: 175 Meds:  Thyroxine .75; simavastin 40mg; lisinopril 5mg; citalopram 40mg; lorazapam when needed which I am in a spell of anxiousness this past week.\n\n",

    "title": "Testosterone Deficiancy??",
    "content": "I'm a new user to this website, so please excuse me if I posted the question in the wrong section.   Well I'm 19 years of age and I weigh 115lbs. For my age and height, according to the charts I have seen, the average weight is aroung 160-175lbs. Now I have a fast metabolism, and I recently asked another doctor and he told me their are two types of \"Fast Metabolisms\". The first one he said is the more common one, with this metabolism he said you eat a lot and your body tends to burn energy efficiently. Also he said, if you eat more than you usually eat you can gain weight slowly. The second metabolism he said is a rare kind to see, with this metabolism he said you tend to eat a lot, and you can eat all you want but you won't put on any weight. The reaason for that he said is, the more you eat the more efficiently your body becomes at using energy. Therefore the more you eat, the faster it gets....  Well recently I went to 2 doctors. Both were general physcians.   The first doctor made me try 5 different techniques.   1. Eat 3300 Calories a day (I ate nearly 6000 a day and didn't gain a pound for the whole month.  2. Eat more Carbs. (Tried this and I ended up losing 2lbs that month)  3.Eat foods that are high in Protein and regularly go to the gym. (Tried this and I didn't gain any weight.) 4.Eat fatty foods, Junk Foods, Ice Cream..etc (Tried this and I still did not gain a pound.)  5. Prescribed Lexpro. (It was suppose to help me gain weight slowly and I did this for 2.5 months and did not gain a pound.   The Second Doctor.  This doctor took a blood test and told me to take Zoloft 50mg. (Did this and did not gain a pound.)   So as you can see I can not gain weight. Now here is the weird part, I got fed up with this and I bought a bottle of Testosterone Cepianate. I was shooting 1cc every 3 days and eating like I normaly do. In two weeks I gained 15lbs and in the total of one month I went from being 115lbs to 145lbs. I lost all that weight now because I did not want to keep injecting myself I figured there has to be a healthier way.   So I'm thinking could it be I have a hormone deficiancy? Maybe low levels of testosterone? All I know is, I just wanna gain weight..\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Apart from nutritional,metabolic, hormonal factors,and diseases one must remember genetic factors too.Without being sure what is causing the problem it is risky to shoot oneself up with hormones.Testosterone being an anabolic steroid it is no surprise that you put on weight.Also this causes salt and water retention contributing to an apparent gain of weight.Testosterone can cause hepatic damage and has been implicated in host of other conditions.Therefore it is just too risky to continue.Also the external supply would cut down production of internal hormones too. The indication in this scenario may only be HIV induced muscle wasting and couple of other medical conditions. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,The most important thing here is to know about androgenic alopecia is that there is a genetic angle to this.Many a times you would find normal testosterone levels but it is the response of the hair follicle that matters.If the follicle is tuned to convert testosterone to dihidro form by alpha reductase enzyme overactivity, it will lead to miniaturization of the hair.Thus it may not be necessary to run these tests in men, except perhaps iron levels and tests for hypothyroidsm.

The doctors were confused as I do not take any medications that would cause this.  I suffer some symptoms such as irregular periods and headaches, however I do not have lactating breasts or a low sex drive- if anything I think its too high. Also I do not have PCOS, so its nothing to do with that.   Other symptoms I suffer from are: -Excessive female facial hair, hair on stomach and on chest. -Extreme tiredness most, if not all, of the time -Constant nausea -Weight gain despite reasonable diet - I've gained about 2 stone in the last year and I eat once a day.  Can you please tell me what it is that is likely to be wrong with me and what kind of things will they do when I go to the endocrinologist, as I cant seem to get a straight answer out of anyone.  Also can you tell me if weight gain is associated with hyperprolactinomia and if so is treatment sucessful in returning a person to a normal weight?  And I would like to know if infertility due to hyperprolactinemia is reversable?   I'm very worried and cant seem to find any answers. The weight gain, hair growth and infertility is extremely depressing and the tiredness and nausea is very difficult to live with. Please can you help me?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,While it is very difficult to give a meaningful reply with out the investigations yet I would venture to offer a birds eye view of hyperprolactinemias. As you would know this hormone is secreted by the pitutary gland and is important hormone secreted during pregnancy and lactation.Sleep stress,nipple stimulation,sexual orgasm are the other physiological causes.Pitutary adenomas represent the main pathological cause other than drug induced and hypothyroid related.Amenorrhea,galactorrohea,and infertility are the cardinal features.Basal fasting PRL levels are measured for assessment of hypersecretion.Oral dopamine antagonists,carbegoline,bromocriptine and surgery in resistant cases are the treatment for adenomas.Bromocriptine is used to restore fertility. Being a hormone with pulsatile nature false elevations are encountered due to wide variations in individuals.MRI evidence of pitutary mass is a relevant investigation. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hair Loss + Low Globulin and High A/G Ratio",
    "content": "Hello,Diffuse hair loss in women is indeed a very disturbing problem.Androgenic alopecia is the commonest cause followed by telogen effluvium,iron deficiency,  thyroid disease and protein deficiency. In telogen effluvium the weak hairs fall only to recover after some time.Stress is an important factor here,so also during convalescence after infective diseases this happens.Everybody loses telogen hairs but here it is a sudden loss. In men there is bi temporal recession but in women the loss is central ie top of scalp.Under the influence of androgens the terminal hairs get converted to vellus hairs and this process is known as miniaturization.Are there genes involved in this?Possibly yes. You are worried whether this is related to albumin and globulin.Lowered albumin can lead to hairfall.Globulins are mainly immunoglobulins.A percentage of normal people have reduced IgG sub sect with out symptoms.Hypogammaglobulinemias may be associated with localized hair loss,ie alopecia areata.But these are not seen in androgenic alopecia.  There is one important information relating to globulins.The degree of baldness can be correlated to reduced concentration of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin(SHBG) leading to elevated levels of free circulating testosterone. Quite a few women present with polycystic ovarian syndrome and alopecia.Also during menopause oestrogen levels decrease leading to an androgenic environment and resultant hair loss. Hope this answers your questions With my best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,It is quite likely in your case that the dosage of thyroxine needs to be titrated properly.The symptoms you narrate like lethargy,hair fall,weight gain,intolerance to temperature all point towards the necessity to get your thyroid profile assessed again.T4 and TSH levels need yearly testing.Do disuss with your physician.Also you may need a complete blood count and your iron levels tested. Deficiency of proteins and other minerals including Biotin needs to be looked into. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello infrance,  This is a difficult situation.  Your symptoms are typical of a low-functioning thyroid, but confirmation of that can only be made through blood tests for thyroid function.  I will list some substances that claim to be helpful in thyroid stimulation, but cannot actually recommend any of them.  They are unregulated and most are available over the counter.  A decision to use them must be made at your own risk.  Perhaps one will sound similar to the one you had success with previously.  \"Thyroid Helper\" claims to be the top supplement to improve thyroid function.  It's available online, and I do not know if it's available in pharmacies or health food stores.  L-tyrosine, iodine, bladderwack (a type of seaweed), progesterone, and adrenal and thyroid glandulars are listed as naturopathic remedies.  I encourage you to see a doctor at your earliest opportunity.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, two weeks ago I went to the doctor for fatigue. He did blood work and said I was hypothyridic with hashimoto's disease. He prescribed 50mcg of levothyroxine. The first few days I was very jittery, but the doctor said it was normal. The forth day I had a major episode where my heart was pounding fast and I was shaking and feeling very anxious. The doctor told me to cut the dose in half. Now after being on 25mcg for a little over a week I am still having these side effects. I have an app. with an endocrinologist in 4 weeks. I am wondering if these side effects are normal and if I should discontinue the meds until I see the specialist. My thyroid was 6.4. I am a 35 year old woman. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It is rather unusual for a levothyroxin dose of 50ug/day to cause such effects in a allegedly hypothyroid adult individual.  Therefore, other contributory causes for your symptoms must be looked for.In individuals who take to thyroxin as an antiobesity drug, especially in conjunction with other agents such as ephedrine or caffeine are at an increased risk of developing hyperthyroidism-like symptoms. Stress and Anxiety are also to be considered in this scenario.  You have not given details of your thyroid profile. The history supplied lacks detail. In this situation, the best i can offer is some general advice.  It will be better for you to review your medications (including herbal). Some cough syrups contain caffeine.Caffeine is present in many dietary sources such as some soft drinks,inks, candy bars, coffee, tea, cola etc.  Discuss with your doctor about these aspects and he/she will be able to guide you through this. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Can hypothyroidism cause all these symptoms?",
    "content": "Hi. I'm new here and wanted to pose a question. First, I'm 39, male, about 190 lbs(now). I was recently diagnosed with hypo and gerd. I'm now taking levothyroxine 25 mcg and Protonix 40 mg. I'm sorry if this is long winded but I need to go back to the beginning when all this started.  In Sept of 2003 I started exercising, nothing strenuous, but just walking. By the 3rd day I was feeling sore somewhat. The next day I had a very uncomfortable tightness in my chest. I had this feeling for around a month or so and then decided to go to a doctor. I had a chest xray and an ekg....both negative. He gave me an antibiotic (Avelox). I finshed it and felt no better. About a month or so later the tightness subsided but I started getting this fleeting kind of a sharp pain in my left inner thigh. It would last anywhere from a couple seconds to a couple minutes. It was sharp and stinging. It would show up sometimes when I was standing, or sitting, or lying down. Sometimes it would occur every day, sometimes more than once a day. Sometimes I might only get it once a week or less. This went on for a few months.   A couple months into getting the pain in my thigh, I also started experience dizzy or vertigo spells. Maybe lightheadedness. It only lasted a couple seconds. I also got what I thought felt like hot flashes. They would come and go, too. Then I started getting these \"tingling sensations\" in different parts of my body. In my legs, toes, arms, fingers. Then I started getting them in my chest. They felt like little bursts of electricity lasting a few seconds and then dissipating. Those were the worst. They seemd to happen when I was laying down  I went to a new doctor and he ran blood tests, everything negative. He also ran an emg on my left leg where I had the pain. Also negative. It's funny because I had done some research before I went to the second doctor and I found that the symptoms I was having could be from hypothyroidism or MS. He ran a TSH test and I asked him point blank if my thyroid was ok and he said it was fine after looking at the results on my followup visit to him. I didn't think anything else of it. But I wasn't satisfied with nothing being found.  Another couple months later after still having these symptoms coming and going, I asked my mother's doctor if she wanted a new patient. I made an appointment with her for a few weeks later, but when I got there she still hadn't received my medical charts. She did diagnose me with GERD, though. I had told her about 2 incidents when I had been abruptly awakened in the middle of the night choking and coughing and feeling vomit coming up my esophogus. On the next visit with her, she had gotten my chart and came in the room pointing at the TSH test results that the previous doctor had ordered. It was 12.9. She put me on the levothyroxine that I am currently taking at 25 mcg. I just took another TSH test and am due to see her again at the beginning of March. Her office called me to make sure I was coming for the appointment and the nurse I spoke with told me my TSH level had come down \"a little\". She said the doctor would adjust my meds on my next appointment.   Anyways, over 1 year later, I still have tightness in my chest, particularly on the left side. I get those \"tingling, electric-like\" sensations periodically, although they do seem to have subsided some. Now though, I just had those sensations in a new area.....my head!. They were on each side of my face in my temples. I also had a long lasting headache that accompanied them. I still get a little vertigo it seems to me. It seems like someone is pushing my head forward when I get that. But this soreness in my left side chest area near my armpit(more in the chest, though) is really bothersome. I still get these fleeting tingles all over on occassion, too.   One more thing I wanted to tell you, whoever is listening, is that right after all this started, when my chest first got tight and uncomfortable, I had this one \"BIG\" episode when I was just starting to drift off to sleep. I was at that stage when I was just almost out and entering \"sleep\", but still a little cognizant when, all of a sudden, I felt this feeling like my body was collapsing into itself and then  it ended with a \"BOOOOOOOM!!! Needless to say, I jumped up from my laying down postion. I was sweating a little and breathing hard. It took me some time to calm down. I never experienced anything like that before in my life. It scared me to death. It happend 2 more times to me, both when I was laying down going to sleep, but not to the extreme of that first time. I told the doctors about it but never heard from any what it was or could have been.   I'm sorry for being so long winded. I guess my only question is can hypothyroidism cause all of the symptoms I described? The tingling and electric-like sensations? My tight chest(constantly sore now)? Sometimes, too, I think I can feel my heart flutter and beat faster for no reason. Does anyone know what to make of this? I've had 2 EKG's both negative. I'd appreciate any comments.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Tony_Ohio, The signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism are: Fatigue, weight gain, feeling cold, constipation, dry skin, coarse, dry hair or hair loss, depression, mental confusion, slow heart rate, muscle aches or cramps, high cholesterol levels, etc. So in answer to your question I would attribute muscle aches  to the hypothyroidism. Gerd can also cause chest pain especially when a person is laying down simply because this position allows the stomach acid to regurgitate (back up). However, the tingling sensations I probably would not relate to either disorder (although not impossible). You mention MS, did your physician evaluate you for this also? The description of a tingling sensation, is this a prickling type of discomfort? An MRI is a diagnostic study that helps to diagnose this condition. I would certainly encourage discussing this with your physician so a diagnosis can be made or ruled out. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Rntdj. No, I have not been evaluated for MS. When I first went to the latest doctor, I described all of my symptoms and she said they could be from hypothyroidism or MS. During that first visit, she had not yet received my chart from the precious doctor with test results I had just taken. On that first visit, she diagnosed me with GERD because of symptoms I was having including a nauseated stomach feeling. heartburn(I hope it is), and regurgitation that occured on two seperate occasions while I was sleeping. On the next visit, she had received my chart and the TSH test that I had taken previously was extremely elevated at 12.9. That is when she diagnosed me with hypothyroidism.  I told her about the \"tingling sensations\" in all parts of my body that come and go and last from 1 to 5 seconds. I, also, told her about that \"tingling, electric-like sensation\" in my chest that I would get when I was lying down. This week I had that same kind of feeling in my left and right side temples of my head. I go back to see her on March 3 and I will be telling her about that then. To me, a lay person, it seems highly improbable that I could have all of these things go wrong with me all of a sudden. And then add an MS possibility on top of that? Can MS cause hypothyroidism or GERD?   I just took another TSH and T1 and T3 test and the nurse st my doctor's office told me that my TSH level came down \"slightly\". I have seen my doctor once since I started on my meds when I took my mother to see her for a checkup. Then she told me she would more than likely adjust my meds on my next visit.  The only reassurance I'm holding on to right now is from others diagnosed with hypothyroidism who belong to the \"About\" hypothyroidism support group who have also confirmed that they too have had or currently have tingling sensations in parts of their bodies. They all also say that the symptoms take a great deal of time to subside and since I'm on such a low dose levothyroxine (25 mcg), I shouldn't expect to feel much better if at all. And I really don't. Another thing I'm holding on to is that I don't have L'Hermittes sign.  My energy level is as low as low can go. I went to bed at 5:00 pm last night and awoke at 4:00 am this morning. I am chronically constipated. I have been in my life for as long as I can remember. I remember having a lot of trouble as a teen going to the bathroom. Sometimes, I will go 4 or 5 days or more between bowel movements. As a matter of fact, I just had a BM yesterday for the first time since this past Sunday. But, I went again this morning, too. It's always been like that. For a short period of time, my BM's will be near normal and then begin to subside in regularity. Then I'll be completely irregular for some time and then it will slowly start to become more normal again. And then the cycle starts all over again.   Over the past year I have put on about 12 to 15 pounds for no apparent reason. I'm sure some of that has to do with the fact that I have a low level of energy and I am not as active as I once was. I have actually (purposefully) cut back on my calories to keep my weight in check. I weighed 180 lbs for at least the last 15 to 17 years. I now weigh around 195 lbs.   I took a cholestoral test for my previous doctor. My LDL was 100 and my HDL was 39. He called my LDL \"high\". On occasion, I feel what I think are heart palpatations. They feel like a fluttering in my chest. I took 2 EKG's which both came out negative.  I feel sort of anxious, too. My chest has been \"uncomfortable\" for over a year now. I get that burning feeling, too. It comes and goes. I don't see it as more prevalent when I'm lying down.   I think my doctor wants to treat me for the hypo first and see how I respond before heading down the MS roadway. I know a lot of the symptoms I am having do compare to those of MS. I'm hoping it's not that. I'm praying it's not that.   All of this started in Sept/Oct of 2003 after I started exercising some. I started walking with some intermittant jogging. On the third day my chest felt heavy and I quit. I had that \"body collapsing\" episode and I went to a doctor. Chest X-ray negative, EKG negative. Then I got that stinging pain in my left inner thigh area. EMG test on left leg negative. Lasted a few months and subsided. Then I started getting those tingles in different areas. I got some lightheadedness on occasion. And some hot flashes. Then I started getting that tingling, radiating pain in my chest when I would be lying down. The best way I can describe it is....... it is similar \"in feeling\" to a stone being dropped into a pond from straight up in the air. The ripples radiate outward fromt he initial impact of the stone. That's what those tingles feel like. They have a center point where they start and they radiate outward. The ones I just experienced in my temples are just like the ones I had in my chest. They only last a couple of seconds. The ones I had in my head early this week were accompanied by a low-level headache. I haven't had them since Monday.   I appreciate your input. I'll let you know how my doctor visit goes and what changes or tests she orders. Talk to you soon.  Tony\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Tony, I would very much appreciate an update on your follow-up visit. Tha fatigue, weight gain etc. are certainly symptoms of hypothyroidism. To my knowledge MS would not cause hypothyroidism nor GERD. MS is difficult to diagnose because many of the symptoms mimic other diseases and is essentially diagnosed by exclusion along with the diagnostic studies of course. Symptoms may come and go over the course of the disease. I would suggest that you discuss diagnostic studies upon your return appointment. Good Luck to you and thank you for using http://www.doctorslounge.com Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "I actually came across your post from doing a search about 'brain tingling' that I have been feeling lately - but I would like to reply particularly to your \"BOOOOOOOM\" experiences as I have had them too and I know what they are.  Firstly I would like to note that I discovered this unsuspectingly and hence did some research on what happened to me and then redid through practice the same thing.   I was out at a concert when this happened. I had nothing to drink but water. Midway through the night I noticed all the lights flashing and my hearing was starting to falter. I told my friends I was going out for some fresh air, but before I got out something very weird happened. I was walking through the crowd, when I felt a weird sensation and I could see myself from behind walking away from me. I then saw myself begin to fall to the ground while I started to float up toward the ceiling. I found myself looking down at my body while the crowd was circling around me. I then saw someone pushing through the crowd to get to me and they bent down towards me and \"BOOOOOOOOOM\" I felt like I was forcefully pulled back into my body with an extremely loud creaking boom. I opened my eyes to see the crowd circled around me and a body guard dragging me from the scene. I remember mumbling to him, 'I saw you coming' - He must have thought that I was mad...  This led to research and OOBE (Out Of Body Experiences) and Astral Projection. Months later after reading some books I recreated what had happened while lying in bed. The basic jist of it is that you relax your body totally while attempting to keep your mind active or awake and the do some type of visualisation to get 'out' of your body (I suppose you could refer to this as your soul). If it goes to plan you leave your body - \" I felt this feeling like my body was collapsing into itself\" - which is your 'soul' leaving your body, sometime I have raised up out of my body, rolled out of my body, and also this collapsed feeling falling through your body to find myself looking down at myself or floating around the room while I see my 'soul' in a ghost form seperate from my body. You obviously don't get to this stage, as you become extremely freaked out by what is happening rather than relaxing. When something startles you then you return to your body. As I discovered this is often accompanied by a loud BOOM noise (I'd liken it to a tear in the time/space continum - but thats a little overboard). So what you experienced was an OOBE but perhaps the first stages of it and not the complete cycle.  I know it sounds freaky. But after lots of research I found than lots of people experience exactly the same things and there are also lots of books on the issue.  All the best,  adhdadult.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. Just thought I'd post a follow-up since it's been awhile.   I've been on the Synthroid for about 9 months now. I started out with 25 mcg for a couple months, took a blood test where the serum TSH still was high, and had the doseage increased to 50 mcg. I have been taking the 50 mcg for about 6 months. I just took another blood test and the doc increased the dose to 62.5 mcg which I will be starting soon as soon as I finish the 50 mcg pills because I had just purchased them.  Some of my symptoms that I reported initially have seemed to subside. I haven't been getting those tingles all over my body nor the hot flashes. I am somewhat better with the energy level than I was, but am still nowhere near where I was before. I tire pretty easily. Every once in a while, I still get some bloating in my stomach. I had an upper GI done and it came out negative. I have stopped all GERD meds and haven't taken any antacids, but maybe on a couple occasions in the last several months. My bowel movements have been more regular. I still get some bouts where I miss a day or two. They are better.   The strange thing I do still experience is that \"burst of tingles\" or \"zapping\" feeling I get in my chest, especially when I lay down. The funny thing about it is that if I lay down and am just laying down, like watching TV, I really don't experience them. I seem to get them only or 99.9% of the time when I am lying down AND I close my eyes attempting to go to sleep. I haven't been able to pinpoint anything that this may reveal. It sounds weird, but that's what happens. It's a pretty uncomfortable feeling. Every time it happens I think it is my heart or something like a blocked artery or something. All the heart tests I have taken, which I know can miss things sometimes, have been negative. I don't know. It's weird.   Another thing I have noticed over the past several months is an occasional throbbing in my neck. Just sometimes. And I occasionally feel a tingling at the base of my neck area in the back, particularly when I bend forward and place the neck in tension in the back.   I just took a lipid profile and my LDL was high at 146 and my HDL was low at 29.  A couple months ago, before I stopped the GERD med Protonix, I took a renal test and it came back high at just over 2. I don't remember the units...sorry. I repeated the test after stopping the GERD med and after waiting for about a month and it came back 1.4......still high, but improved. I found out that Protonix can invoke an increase in the measure of serum creatinine( that's the units) in the blood. I hope my kidneys aren't permanently damaged.   Before I go back for my next exam in December, I will be taking more blood tests. I'll have the TSH checked again, \"free T4\", BMP, and a CBC. I'll post a follow-up then if you're interested.   I hope that any of the information I post can help anyone else experiencing similar symptoms or conditions. For now I'm just going to start my 62.5 mcg Synthroid doseage and see what happens.   Tony\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there, I to have had some of symptoms you refer to, they started about a year ago. I have a vibration in my chest that only occurs right before I go to sleep and I wake up with it. I get pins and needles as well, and sometimes the vibration feels more like a tremor in my upper body.  I believe it is sometimes brought on by exercise but I am not certain, I do also get a sharp pain in my left hip, and I had something similar waking up in the middle of the night to a ringing in my ear, that is why I  replied to you because your symptoms were so similar. I can get light headed when I stand up and I do get dizzy spells.  I have noticed other people with these kinds of symptoms before on internet sights (mostly the vibration in the chest right before sleep and waking up with it)  but I have never replied. I have also noticed that noboby really knows what is wrong with them and they are unable to get any definitive answers. I have had some tests done as well that have come up negative and have been told nothing is wrong me. I try to ignore my symptoms and move on but sometimes they get worse and I these symptoms are hard to ignore. I guess my fear is that they are going to get worse. I will say this I watch my diet much more now, I don't drink alcohol anymore and I try to exercise regularly now. These are things I didn't always do so well in the past but I am getting better at. The exercise is difficult because sometimes I think that it brings on my symptoms( the vibrations at night in my chest mostly). Anyway if you get any information you could share it would be much appreciated.\n\n",

I have had nearly every symptom you describe and I have gone to doctor after doctor.  My endocrinoligist kept telling me it was not thyroid related, but after your posting I seriously question that.  If we both have hypothyroidism I believe it must be related.  I too have had hot flashes and cold flashes, brain fog, tingling, dizziness and even the breathing problem you described.  The doctor who responded to this post suggested that you be tested for MS.  I went through having a brain MRI and everything was fine.  Your post has given me hope that the right endocrinoligist might be able to shed some light on all this.  However, I'm not sure what my next step will be.  Your post was extremely helpful.

    "content": "I am new to this site, but after finding this particular discussion I had to post.  I am female, age 34.    I don't HAVE hypothyroidism (nor any other diagnosis) (I am NOT on meds of any kind either) and I have all of the same issues you have all expressed.  My symptoms started with headaches as a kid/pre-teen, then fatigue, then insomnia, then constipation (which turned to IBS for a small amount of time) - now just chronic constipation...I also have the vertigo spells and dizziness. I black out when I get up, exercise or bend down too fast. I also have the equivalent to an electrical shock running up my left arm from time to time that only lasts about 5-10 seconds.  PLUS I have heart palpitations, shortness mixed with heaviness of breath and tearing sensations in the chest... AND I have the BOOOM out of sleep ...not to mention I fall asleep at the wheel.  Docs have run every test they could think of so far - all have turned out negative.  But TWICE this week (while sitting in my reclining chair) - I have had those out of body experiences that basically include the tingling all over body (but not pins and needles/no pricking just tingling), the hot and cold temp changes, the dizzyness and vertigo/soul leaving the body/disoriented sensations.  Both have lasted less than 20 seconds but it literally takes my whole body and mind over.  I am conscious when it happens obviously but I feel out of control over my consciousness if that makes sense.  It's like I am FORCED to surrender to what is happening. Even though I have NO CLUE what this is.  Anyhow...I KNOW that all the tests have come out negative - but my son is starting out with the same symptoms I had near his age - - and to be honest I don't want him to follow in these steps.  Then there is this bigger fear that this is some sort of mini stroke or heart attack waiting to happen that I won't be able to come back from if I don't get this diagnosed.  Should I be alarmed?  Should I go and see someone about these episodes?  What is this?  I don't get it.\n\n",

The \"boom\" you desribe happens tp me all the tim, almost like I am falling then I am jolted awake. I have all the tingly, electric vibrations and shocks you describe a well. Fibromyalgia, MS, Lupis, nerve disorders are al common with hypo, or any thyroid disease. And next time you go to your doc, ask for a complete thyroid panel, TSH,T4 and T3 levels. You can have abnormal TSH and normal T4 and T3, and vise versa. So get it checked. It sounds like you have found a pretty good doctor though, but an endocrinologist is who you really should see. Believe me, they are better at knowing wht's going on than a GP, but too, I did have an awesome GP where I used to live and had no need for an endo. I hope this is the case for you.\n\n",

I got to a doctor, and she gave me Trycycline (because at that time I did not know I took aless 1 year and a half ago). I decided  to take it July 4, 2010, after just waiting to see if I will get my period.   After I took trycycline, I got a little moody/depressed.

Sometimes discomfort in chest/heart.  And this sunday I got on placebo, and yesterday (wed) I was suppose to get my period. I got it but this time it is just little bit of brown, little bit of spotting blood. It is not coming like it is suppose to.

    "content": "Hi,  Gynaecomastia (\u201cfemale-like\u201d breasts in men) is a benign enlargement of the male breast.  Gynaecomastia may be, - unilateral. - bilateral symmetrical. or - bilateral asymmetrical.  Some of the causative factors: - idiopathic (cause unknown-perhaps the commonest), - physiological (pubertal, elderly males-fairly common), - congenital or Hereditary Gynecomastia,  - Medications(Anabolic steroids,risperidone,Estrogens,ketoconazole,,etc ), - alcohol, - marijuana, - impaired liver function(cirrhosis), - cancer, - Klienfelter\u2019s syndrome(XXY), - testicular failure (eg, anorchia, viral orchitis).  Webster classification of gynecomastia is useful in planning the management: - glandular((subcutaneous mastectomy), - fatty-glandular(Liposuction-assisted subcutaneous mastectomy) and - pure fatty (Liposuction).  Endoscopic subcutaneous mastectomy has made an entry as one of the surgical options.  Pubertal gynecomastia usually resolves spontaneously within 3 years in approximately 90% of patients. If hypogonadism (primary or secondary) is the cause,parenteral or transdermal testosterone replacement therapy is most useful.  A plethora of drugs have been tried in the treatment of idiopathic gynecomastia but, results are not uniformly convincing.  You need to consult your doctor and get investigated to determine the cause of gynecomastia in your case, so that, management options can be decided upon. Best wishes!\n\n",

Unfortunately I don\u2019t have much access to family medical history, but as far as I know there is no history of major disease.  In general I feel fine, with no major health problems that I know of \u2013 at least possibly until now.  At my latest physical last month, the routine blood work indicated my glucose level has shot up to 114, though I had the blood drawn in the morning to take advantage of the night time sleep hours for the fast. (At my prior physical 2 years ago, the glucose level was 83).  My blood pressure and cholesterol levels are normal.  What might be some possible causes for such a dramatic rise in glucose level?  Could alcohol consumption prior to the start of the fasting period have affected the level?  I\u2019ve been asked to return in 3 months to re-test, and plan not to drink the evening before, but am already very anxious.  Could I be in danger of becoming diabetic?  Could long-term regular drinking be the cause?  Are there any lifestyle changes I can make at this stage to prevent the onset of diabetes?  Are there supplements that might help promote healthier glucose levels?  Do I have to give up alcohol all together or can cutting back make any kind of difference?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Concerned About Increased Glucose Level",
    "content": "Hi, Thank you for the post. Firstly, kindly refer to the following link that may be useful to you. http://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/vie ... 94&t=48731  American Diabetes Association (ADA) has recommended a new category - \"impaired fasting glycaemia\" (IFG)- when fasting plasma glucose level is lower than that required to diagnose diabetes but higher than the reference range (< 7.0 mmol/L but >= 6.1 mmol/L).  Cut off points for interpreting diabetes mellitus(ADA 1997):  - fasting venous plasma glucose <7 mmol/l(ADA non-diabetic) or fasting plasma glucose >= 7.0 mmol/l (ADA diabetic),   - for venous whole blood are fasting blood glucose <6.1(ADA non-diabetic), versus >= 6.1 mmol/l (ADA diabetic) and   - for capillary whole blood, values same as those for venous whole blood.   One single fasting glucose level of 114mg/dl (you have not indicated which method was used in measuring this),is about 4 mg higher than the 6.1 mmol/l figure mentioned above.   From an epidemiological point of view,  - if plasma glucose level had been used, then it will indicate an \"impaired fasting glycaemia\" - if venous whole blood or capillary whole blood were used, then it will indicate an 'ADA diabetic' value.  Alcohol and blood sugar: One of the known pharmacologic actions of ethylalcohol is to lower blood sugar.   One interesting comparative study (1971)on wines vs diluted alcohol and blood glucose levels makes the following observations. \"Wines contain varying amounts of carbohydrate, ranging from 0.1% for the so-called 'dry' wines to 15% or more for certain 'sweet wines' . These 'sweet wines' can predictably overcome the glucose-lowering effect of ethanol but it is not clear whether this is also true of the dry table wines\". Results: The decrease in blood glucose was approximately 10% after both the wine and the alcohol administration.  Conclusion: The carbohydrate content of these dry wines was too low to affect the blood glucose. (The America,z Journal of Clinical Nutrition 24: App.n. 1971, pp. 394-396).  I hope this information answers some of your doubts. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hypothyroidism Symptoms But T3,T4,TSH are Normal",
    "content": "Hi, \"Reverse T3 (rT3) Dominance\" is a condition which needs to be excluded first in your case. The thyroid gland produces two main hormones: thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3).T3 is only produced in small amounts by the throid, but it is the active form of the T4.The conversion from T4 to T3 occurs peripheral tissues. In some conditions, a molecule called Reverse T3 (rT3) is produced out of T4 rather than T3. rT3 is biologically inactive. If this is produced in excess, the condition of \"Reverse T3 (rT3) Dominance\" results and many of these patients exhibit clinical features of hypothyroidism in the presence of apparently normal thyroid function test results.  Kindly visit the following link for further information on this. Please do consult your regular doctor and have this possibility excluded.  http://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/vie ... ypothyroid Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I always insist that readers must provide the laboratory reference ranges alongside the lab results so that meaningful inferences may be drawn.Laboratory reference ranges vary from laboratory to laboratory.You have said that your laboratory told you that the T3 is 'decreased'. Here is one reference range for T3 according to 'my'(!) laboratory - 110-230 ng/dl (in adults). Of course your lab has reported in ng/ml. As per 'my' lab, your T3 value is at the lower end of the 'normal' range(low, yes- but still normal).This demonstrates the importance of the lab reference ranges. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There are hormonal treatments that help some men, especially adolescents but in many cases surgery is needed to remove the excess tissue.  In many young men, the problem resolves on its own within three years so often the first line of treatment is watch and see.  But if it causes discomfort and embarrassment, you may not want to wait it out.  There is a correlation with weight, so if you are overweight, reduction would be an important part of the treatment and prevention.  Also, use of drugs and alcohol can interfere with hormones so it is best to avoid these and concentrate on healthy practices, including diet.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a generally healthy, physically active 33 year old male. I first saw a doctor for gynecomastia when I was a teenager. It seemed to reappear in my early-mid twenties. It got noticeably worse after I used illegal steroids for 6-8 months in 2004. I have not used steroids since then but the breast tissue seems to be growing worse especially on the left side. Other potential causes of this could be medication for depression/anxiety I took throughout my twenties, alcohol use and marijuana use.  I had my blood tested last year and my testosterone levels were within the normal range but on the low end. My estrogen level was normal, so my doctor told me marijuana was not the cause so I still smoke pretty regularly. The doctor verified that I have gynecomastia and suggested I take zinc to help the symptoms. I've been surfing for 4 years and lifting weights on and off, back in the gym for the last few months. It's been my hope that cutting body fat and working on my chest at the gym would help the gynecomastia and it may be helping but it's hard to tell.  For about 3 weeks I've been taking Novedex XT, a testosterone booster that supposedly minimizes the production of estrogen. Also, to cut body fat I've been taking a low dosage of Hydroxycut Hardcore for the same time period. Both are not FDA approved. I want to know if you think I am doing the right thing here. The last thing I want to do is make it worse. I do not want to have surgery for this. Please advise and let me know if there are other non surgical solutions for my problem.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Help with understanding ADH blood test",
    "content": "Hi, Osmolality (osmolarity) shows(in lay terms) how much concentrated or dilute your plasma is. It depends chiefly upon the concentration of certain electrolytes such as sodium(Na) and potassium (K), certain other molecules such as blood sugar and urea. An increase or decrease in the water part of the plasma will thus alter the osmolality.  In health, osmolality of plasma keeps changing and mostly regulates itself. For example, when you sweat too much, plasma becomes concentrated (osmolality increases) and this acts on osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus of the brain to stimulate production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) to be transported to the posterior pituitary gland from where it is secreted into the circulation. ADH acts  on the kidneys to withhold excretion of water so that, the urine becomes concentrated (urine osmolality increases) and plasma becomes diluted(osmolality decreases to normal levels).   in healthy adults who have no fluid restrictions and a normal activity level, normal plasma concentration of ADH is 0.35-1.94 ng/L (0.32-1.80 pmol/L). However, such low levels cannot be measured with certainty by most assays. Therefore, for best interpretation of results, ADH values should be correlated with plasma osmolality, electrolye levels(chiefly Na) and urine  osmolality.  Diabetes insipidus(DI) may be caused by 1. a defect in Anti-diuretic hormone production, or 2. a defect in the kidneys' response to ADH. Usually the patients with Diabetes insipidus pass >3litres/24 hours of low osmolality (<300 mOsmol/kg) urine. (Defects in Anti-diuretic hormone production may arise from conditions affecting the hypothalamus/posterior pitutary (cranial,central DI or neurogenic DI). Defect in the kidneys' response to ADH is called as Nephrogenic DI).  In the presence of nephrogenic DI, plasma ADH levels are usually elevated in relation to plasma osmolality. Conversely, with neurogenic DI, ADH levels decrease as plasma osmolality increases. In neurogenic DI, usually the plasma osmolality  >295 mmol/L and serum sodium >145 meq/L and  Urine osmolality is < 300 mmol/L.  ADH assays: are not routinely performed because of their complexity and lack of specificity/sensitivity. ADH assays(if available) can only help to support the diagnosis of DI along with other values as already alluded to.  Lab values you have mentioned appear to be within normal range but, as explained earlier not very helpful on their own. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hypothyroid Symptoms, normal test results",
    "content": "Hi, It would have been helpful if you had provided the values of all the thyroid function tests as well as results of other lab tests such as Hb%, ESR etc.You have not indicated if you have a goiter.The other important consideration is your country of residence(iodine deficient or iodine sufficient zone).  As your symptoms seem to have appeared following a cesarean delivery 5 years ago, an condition related to or aggravated by pregnancy assumes priority.  There are two of such conditions are, - Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis and - postpartum thyroiditis.  By far, the most common cause of hypothyroidism during pregnancy is  Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis (one type of autoimmune thyroiditis). Approximately, only about 2.5% of women will have an elevated TSH (>6) and about 0.4% will have a level of > 10 during pregnancy.   In Hashimoto's disease, TSH levels may be normal, as  more TSH is secreted by the pitutary in response to declining T4 levels. This drives the remaining healthy thyroid follicles to produce more T4 which then normalizes the TSH. An increasing TSH (after an initial period of stable levels) would indicate that the thyroiditis is progressing and continuing to destroy more and more of the remaining thyroid follicles and therefore the TSH is being secreted in increasing amounts to maintain a euthyroid state.T4 & T3 levels also initially may remain within normal ranges.  Women at risk: Screening is recommended by some for women with the folllowings risk factors. - women with goiters, - women with a strong family history of thyroid diseases, - women with a past history of postpartum thyroiditis, and - women with autoimmune disorders(rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and lupus erythematosus).  Postpartum thyroiditis: is a mostly temporary, painless inflammation of the thyroid gland of uncertain etiology (thought to be an autoimmune disease akin to Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis) that occurs within a year following 5% to 10% of all pregnancies. Resembles Hashimoto's in that it many women with this disease also have presence of certain antithyroid antibodies (Thyroperoxidase antibodies or TPOab) in their blood and that histopathologically also it is difficult separate them. Postpartum thyroiditis has also been noted to occur in women who do not have anti-thyroid antibodies in their blood.  The classic clinical course of postpartum thyroiditis is one of thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism.  There variations in its course have been noted and they are - a hyperthyroid phase followed by a return to a euthyroid state, - a hypothyroid phase alone - a hyperthyroid phase followed by a hypothyroid phase.  Presentation with hypothyroid phase alone is the commonest.  Post-partum thyroiditis is often missed and its symptoms (both hypo and hyperthyroid) often get attributed to the normal stresses which a woman typically faces following a delivery. Symptoms occur 4-8 months following delivery and may go on for up to 9 \u201312 months. Most women return to a euthyroid state in about 12-18 months of the onset of symptoms. However, a minority (20-30% of those that go into a hypothyroid phase) will continue to remain hypothyroid.  I am not aware if you have been tested for the aforesaid possibilities.If not, you should consult your endocrinologist and have yourself assessed. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I started with symptoms rather suddenly in 2007. Started with headaches, fever to 101.0, head covered in sweat. Went to GP, ID, ENT with only newly formed High Blood Pressure. Tremors (intent) started within 4 months. Blood pressure still unregulated and ANA/C reactive protiens are elevated. I demand an MRI. Found \"extensive white matter disease/demyelination\". Sent to Neurologist, 1 band present in CSF. Sent also to Rheum. for possibly connective tissue disease. To Neurologist in NYC at Columbia Presby. Another band found in CSF. MRI's show no additional demyelination. Dr. is confused as images \"say\" MS, but exam is not typical of MS. Headaches, fever, temors, fatigue, weight gain and sweating continues. Neuro suggests Endocrinologist. T3 and T4 normal. After much prodding, Endo has recently completed a 24 hour urine that came back normal. Next month will be a cortisol test.  I have been reading about the Hypothalamus/pituitary/adrenal path. I know that I don't have an adenoma on my pituitary as this would have been seen on the MRI. And now that my urine test has come back normal, I am concerned that I will be labeled \"a depression/anxiety\" case. I KNOW there is something wrong, somewhere that is making this sudden onset of headache, fever, sweating (profuse!), happen to me every morning after I get up! I cannot be outside if it is over 68degrees because of the constant head sweating, rapid fatigue, oh and freezing feet that goes with it. I cannot exert myself in the least or this will happen all over again through out the entire day.  It stands to reason that something is creating my homeostasis to go out of whack, but where and how? None of the symptoms are typical of MS, and my Neuro isn't even sure that is what I have because I don't present typically.  I have a rounded face now, weight gain, my sleep is all over the place. It matches Cushing's, but I don't know what the Dr. will do if all the lab work comes back within normal ranges...  My question is this. What do you do when all the \"surface\" tests come back normal but the symptoms continue and worsen...  Thank you for your time and thoughts on this! Cris 44yr. old mother of 2\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Will thyroid medication help my anxiety symptoms",
    "content": "Hi, As you have not included the 'laboratory reference ranges' for the values of your thyroid function tests, meaningful interpretation is rather difficult.  Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with subtle cognitive impairment and this is seen to occur mostly in the elderly.  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2631617/).  The association between thyrotoxicosis and mental changes is still being elucidated. It is increasingly being realized that thyrotoxicosis can 'cause' and manifest with neuropsychiatric symptoms.   The most common mental changes observed in thyrotoxic individuals are , anxiety, apprehension, emotional lability, irritability, and  disorders of concentration.  Abnormalities of cognition include, occasional impaired short-term memory, a shortened attention span, and distractibility.  Psychosis is rare, but some patients may present with a frank psychosis associated with delusions & paranoia. An higher incidence of depression has also been reported.  It has been observed since many years that the elderly thyrotoxic patients may present in strikingly different fashion from younger patients. Rather than exhibiting hyperactivity and anxiety, these patients tend to present with a more \u201capathetic\u201d clinical picture, including lethargy, depression, and pseudodementia.  You have not mentioned if you have consulted a psychiatrist for your anxiety symptoms. If your repeat thyroid function test results show a picture of frank thyrotoxicosis, you will be of course treated for that. On the other hand, if results show 'subclinical' hyperthyroidism, it is best left to your psychiatrist and endocrinologist to take a decision jointly as to how the subclinical thyrotoxic state should be managed.You may of course voice your concerns.   Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Seizures at pre-menopause, doubt epilepsy diagnosis",
    "content": "I have experienced mild (partial and partial complex) epileptic seizures sporadically since the onset of pre-menopause in 2003.  Sometimes they occur monthly as a period would, other times they go for 1 to 5 years without happening at all.  99% of the time they happen 30 minutes after I wake in the morning, but never when my mind is actively engaged in any task, such as driving or even talking.  I cannot find any sort of doctor who will make the connection between hormones and seizures...the neurologist just wants to give me anti-epileptic drugs without further research.  At my suggestion, the endocrinologist prescribed progesterone cream, which was or wasn't successful as I had nothing to measure it against.  I used that for about 6 months but then weaned myself off of it to see if the seizures would start again.  They did, but not within a significant period of time.  I tend to think this is not truly epilepsy but temporary due to fluctuating hormones.  My last period (I thought) was in June 2008, but just last month (June 2010) I had another one.  Before the seizures in 2003 my periods started to become erratic.  Unfortunately I went to a GYN and she put me on one of those extended birth control pills so I would only have 4 periods per year.  None of them agreed with me (made me sick) so I decided not to take them.  However, I took myself off them too suddenly and went into withdrawals.  Got my first headache EVER at 42 and it was a migraine that landed me in the ER.  Less than a week later the seizures started.  They were numerous and unpredictable for a short time, but started gradually to follow a monthly pattern. Then they just faded away altogether.  Five years later they started up again, this time on a monthly basis, seemingly in place of a period.  I blame the whole thing on those birth control pills.  I am a very health conscious individual with no family history of anything and this shouldn't be happening.  My question is which type of doctor to see, neurologist, endocrinologist or something entirely different? The neurologists only want to treat the seizures, not research why they're happening so I can stop them naturally.  I didn't realize how difficult it would be to find a doctor who makes the connection like I have.  I learned that estrogen can be seizure-inducing and progesterone seizure-inhibiting.  This is why I asked for the progesterone cream.  Should I just go with the neurologist and take the drugs?  I really don't want to but I have to stop the seizures, even as intermittent as they are.  I can't be the doctor, but I can't get the doctors to hear me.  I hope you can help.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I'm 21 years old and i don't feel nor look like most of my friends.  I have very little facial hair and the facial hair that I do have are extremely thin and hardly noticeable.  My body is also very unusual in the matter that I have really small hands, feet, fingers, a really thin neck, and my legs don't look proportional to my upper body (my legs are extremely skinny and small).  It seems as if all the weight that I gain goes to my torso.  I go to the gym often so I do have some muscle, but most of the muscle that I have are in my upper arms (biceps, triceps) and my chest and back, but I have very little muscle on my thighs and close to none on my calves.  I work out most of my body but it seems like only my arms and chest get bigger.  My bones also seem very underdeveloped and thin.  I have TMJ so almost anything I eat will cause my jaws to crack.  Anything from a banana to a small piece of candy could cause my jaws to crack.  Eating around people can be really embarrassing, and trying to keep my jaws from cracking is close to impossible.  My wrists, ankles, knees are also very thin and have no fat nor muscle which makes them crack at random times throughout the day.  My nails are also extremely thin and they either look really purple or hot pink.    I try to talk to my doctor about these kinds of things but she always answers by telling me that i'm naturally skinny and I won't gain any weight until I'm around 25 years old, but a lot of what I think is wrong with me isn't all about my weight.   I just want to know if there's something wrong with me whether it be a tumor in my pituitary gland, low testosterone, low growth hormones, or whatever and how I go about getting help.  Thanks, any advice and comments are appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,It is not uncommon to have delayed ejaculation, if it only does not occur with regularity.Stress could be a factor if you are having ejaculation during night emissions. There are two types.Lifelong vs situational.The earlier one is lifelong starting immedietly after puberty.The later related to delayed ejaculation occuring after a few years. Generalized relates to all types of sexual activity masturbation,sex  etc while situational relates to specific activity,partner or time. Some medications could cause this too including illegal drugs and excess alcohol.Pschycological causes,prostatic infections,injury to nerves,diabetes etc. Anxiety is the commonest cause in your age group.

For the last 4-5 years my body has stopped developing but I feel that I have now completed male development, I am 5'11\", 235 lbs. I developed pubic hair when I was in my late teen years and also underarm hair; however, it is pretty fine and thin, especially under my arm (you almost cant tell). My penis and testicles are rather small, about 3\"(flaccid, not large in diameter either) and 2\" respectively. I have facial hair but it is not coarse, just as soft as the hair on my head. I am concerned that I may have some pituitary or gonadotropin issue, I am just too modist to go visit a doctor. Is this something that should be a concern, anything that I can try before seeing a doctor?\n\n",

I was informed that the entire right lobe plus the isthmus was removed.  During this year following my surgery, I have begun to feel more lethargic.  Nothing completely horrible, but tired enough to notice a difference from my \"pre-surgery self\".  I have been going for regular tests to check my thyroid every 6 months.  While my GP states that my tsh levels are within the normal range, there has been a steady rise in my these levels (from 1.8 pre-surgery to 3.44 as of February 2010).  Is this something to be concerned about?  My doctor doesn't seem to be worried about it however, I am concerned with how this change in tsh would affect my chances of conception.  I suffered a miscarriage 10 months ago and have read that thyroid problems, should they remain untreated, can cause infertility.  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Rise in TSH post thyroid lobectomy - affecting fertility?",
    "content": "Hi, As a screening tool for thyroid function in a population, serum TSH levels are good.For management of an individual patient, TSH levels can not be viewed in isolation. They have to be interpreted in conjunction with the symptoms, and the free thyroid hormone levels.  Serum TSH levels are determined by the - action of the pitutary gland which secretes the TSH in response to low levels of the thyroid hormones in the blood and - the ability of the thyroid follicular cells to respond to the TSH and increase their secretion of the thyroid hormones.  If the thyroid is able to respond, then the level of thyroid hormones in the blood will increase and the stimulus for TSH release no more exists.Thus, the TSH level normalizes.  In case, the thyroid is diseased and not able to respond, the TSH levels remain elevated or continue to rise.  Since late 2002, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)  revised the normal range to 0.3-3.0 for serum TSH levels.Prior to 2002, the commonly used range was 0.5-5.0. As explained earlier, TSH levels must not be interpreted in isolation.  As you have undergone a 'hemithyroidectomy', only one of your thyroid lobe now remains. If it is healthy, the TSH values should not continue to rise.A rising TSH may indicate that the remaining lobe is not functionally adequate.  I urge you to repeat the TSH & free thyroid hormone levels (if you so desire,in another laboratory). If the TSH levels are even above 2.0, you may need to be treated for hypothyroidism as you are symptomatic.Consult an endocrinologist who will be able to guide you through this.The remaining lobe also needs to be assessed(FNAC, radiactive iodine uptake etc as indicated). Best wishes!\n\n",

T3 is reported as ng/dl and FT3 as pg/ml (i do agree, it is rather confusing!). Hope you mean a T4 level of 13.8 ug/dl.

As i explained earlier, for TSH levels over 2.0mU/L, some endocrinologists would prefer to start on thyroxin if the symptoms and findings of physical examination are compelling. As mentioned earlier, the remaining thyroid lobe needs to be assessed before starting thyroxin.  Best wishes!\n\n",

The first time I tried to have sex I was very drunk so I put the fact I could not keep an erection down to alcohol. However when I tried to have sex with my current girlfriend the same thing happened. This time I put it down to nerves as I had never had sex before. However I still can\u2019t maintain an erection during sex, and what makes me think it\u2019s more than just a physiological issue is that I also find it hard to maintain when my girlfriend is just doing other stuff, or even when I\u2019m masturbating myself, my penis often stays hard in such situations for about 5 minutes and will then go to a semi-hard state, then when I ejaculate it goes back to a hard state again. I have recently been to the doctor who has done a blood test and the results came back perfect except it said I had a low blood count, but I\u2019m going for a repeat test in about 2 weeks as apparently this result can often occur and is nothing to worry about. I am just wondering what I can do next, are there any serious but rare diseases that can affect my age range causing the problem or could it really be physiological even when masturbating myself? Thanks for taking the time to read Sam\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, From your descriptions it looks as if the inability to achieve erection has been after an alcoholic binge. Possibly, this has led to performance anxiety and thus the inability the second time. This is known as psychogenic ED (Erectile Dysfunction). Since you are normal otherwise, with sexual hairs and proper height and weight, it is unlikely that you may have congenital syndromes associated with ED like Gonadal dysgenisis etc. ED is defined as a consistant inability to achieve and mantain a erection for a sufficient satisfactory intercourse. Apart from psychogenic ED, Vasculogenic, Neurogenic, Endocrine causes and drug related causes are the known factors. Certain tests like noctornal penile tumescence (NPT) testing and doplar scans and cavernosgraphy to identify venous leaks are used in practice.  Psychotherapy, vacuum devices, intracavernous injections and sildenafil (viagra), are the different modes of treatment based on the clinical and laboratory tests. Surgery maybe indicated for venus leakage.  If your having night erections, the possibility of anything abnormal is unlikely. However, it would be prudent to consult a specialist to treat ED.  Best Wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Hypothyroidism Agitated by Birth Control?",
    "content": "Around November of 2008 I suddenly began to have heavy, painful, and inconsistent periods. Along with that I also became extremely depressed and tired, I often would have to leave school because I felt so out of it and on the verge of tears. Up until this point my period was usually exactly on time, almost to the day, about 5 days and extremely light. Once my cramps became so painful that I was passing out my mother took me to the gyno. I was then put on LoEstrin BC to help the pain and to regulate my periods. The LoEstrin seemed to do that, but around 3 months I thought my hair and nails were becoming brittle so I asked to try another pill. I was then put on Yaz, which made my life miserable. My moods got erratic again and I went back to having heavy and painful periods along with horrid leg cramps.  Next I was put on Seasonique in March of 2009, which seemed to work pretty well. I had a few leg cramps but started taking Calcium which stopped them. Soon I realized though that I started gaining weight. I thought that a combination of my BC and my first semester in college was the cause of nearly 15 pound weight gain (when before this I could barely break 100 pounds), but then I soon realized I was having difficulty losing the weight, even when I would exercise and burn about 500 calories a night at the gym, and I seemed to balloon with any little thing I ate. I became tired, my hands and feet were constantly cold, developed \"non-allergic rhinitis\", and suffered many sinus and respiratory infections. Then in March of 2010 my arms and legs started cramping so bad that I could barely use my arms, my became short of breath, had horrible headaches, was exhausted and had a hard time just walking to class - eventually I ended up in the ER where they thought I had a blood clot, but luckily, did not.  I stopped taking Seasonique and then tried LoSeasonique which did pretty much the same thing, and now am back on LoEstrin, which I am now feeling half way decent again. Could I have a hypothyroid problem that is being agitated by birth control? I want to ask my gyno about it i a few weeks, but I was hoping for some feedback before I did so I didn't feel foolish telling him my thoughts - so any input would be great! :)\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hypothyroidism Agitated by Birth Control?",
    "content": "Hi,  Your symptoms can well be caused by hypothyroidism as well as a host of other conditions.  I will confine my reply to the associations between oral contraceptives and thyroid disorders in general and thyroid function tests in particular.  The thyroid hormones, T4 and T3 circulate in the blood bound to 3 different binding proteins- thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine-binding prealbumin [TBPA, or transthyretin (TTR)], and albumin.  Approximately 99.97% of circulating T4 and 99.7% of circulating T3 are bound to these proteins. TBG carries 70% of the circulating T4 and T3 due to its higher affinity. Rest of the thyroid hormones are in the \"free form\". It is the free form that is active and is responsible for the regulatory negative feedback loop involving the hypothalamic-pitutary-thyroid axis.  There are binding sites on the TBG molecule.Normally only 25% lo 35% of the TBG binding sites are occupied by thyroid hormone. TBG is synthesized as well as cleared by the liver.  Alterations in serum levels of these binding proteins will alter the total levels of the thyroid hormones in serum.  \"Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia\" is a condition due to multiple causes, wherein there is an increase in the 'total' serum thyroid hormone levels but, the person remains euthyroid. However, the 'free' thyroid hormone levels remain normal.  One of the causes of \"Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia\" is oral contraceptive intake. This may lead to misinterpretation of thyroid function tests in women taking oral contraceptives.    Estrogens stimulate the production of TBG by the liver and increase the glycosylation of TBG, thereby reducing its clearance and lead to an increased serum concentration of TBG and consequently, an increased number of available sites to bind T4. An increase in the number of T4 binding sites will be accompanied by a fall in the free T4 level. The normal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis will respond to this fall in T4 levels, and thyroid hormone synthesis will increase. Once TBG levels are stabilized and the new sites are occupied such that the basal equilibrium between free and bound T4 is restored and the free T4 remains normal, thyroid hormone synthesis will return to baseline to maintain normal free T4 levels. Total T4 levels are, however, remain increased. A similar change affects T3 as well.  Patients with euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia usually are asymptomatic. However, persons who have thyroid hormone resistance may exhibit symptoms of hypothyroidism.  Therefore, in your case, among other causes, euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia (perhaps caused by oral contraceptives) associated with thyroid hormone resistance needs to be excluded.  You must consult an endocrinologist and have yourself fully assessed. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: TSH Normal, fT4 Normal, fT3 HIGH but with HYPOthyroid sympts",
    "content": "Hi, In the blood, thyroid hormones exist in two forms- T4 and T3. T3 is the active form. T3 is primarily synthesized by monodeiodiation of T4 in the peripheral tissues(chiefly in the liver and kidneys) rather than by direct secretion by the thyroid gland. Physical, mental and environmental stresses can inhibit the deiodinating enzyme, causing less T4 to be converted to T3, and thereby decreasing the amount of active thyroid hormone available to the cells. Besides, more T4 is gets shunted towards production of rT3(a bioloigically inactive form of T3) causing an elevation in rT3.  Total Free T3(FT3) measurement measures T3 and rT3 combined. Therefore, if an rT3 elevation is suspected,  a measurement of rT3 must be performed. This is valuable in identifying a condition called \"Reverse T3 Dominance\".  When a patient produces excessive levels of rT3 they will usually present with hypothyroid symptoms.  Many factors can elevate rT3 levels:     - Chronic illnesses,     - Low protein intake / poor protein digestion,     - High simple carbohydrate intake,     - Starvation diets, fasting,     - Cadmium, mercury and lead toxicity      - Selenium deficiency,     - Potassium and Zinc deficiency,     - High stress levels (especially high cortisol),     - Compromised liver or kidney function.  Therefore, in your case, a possible 'Reverse T3 Dominance' needs to be excluded.Slightly elevated T3 levels may also occur in pregnancy or during estrogen therapy.  Since late 2002, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) revised the normal range to 0.3-3.0 for serum TSH levels.Prior to 2002, the commonly used range was 0.5-5.0.    Your TSH in July of 2010 was 2.33. Although this falls within the 'normal' range, TSH levels must not be interpreted in isolation.If the TSH levels are even above 2.0, you may need to be treated for hypothyroidism as you are symptomatic.  I hope this information is is helpful. Best wishes!\n\n",

The thyroid hormone and iodine supplementation have slowed the weight gain down only a little. I just started (just took my 2nd dose) Dostinex for the prolactinoma. Currently my doctor is on vacation and won't be back until the end of July, so I am left wondering what could be causing all of this until she gets back. I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask. So, basically, I am asking if there could still be a growth hormone problem even though the IGF-1 was elevated.   Thanks...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Thank you for your post. Human growth hormone's effects on body weight is mainly by increasing muscle mass and by increasing bone growth(during the growth phase). It causes breakdown of fat(lipolysis).  To make it more comprehensible, let me first provide information about what is popularly termed the \"growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor (GH-IGF) axis\" and its relevance to your query.  Growth hormone is produced by the pitutary gland under the influence of the hypothalamic hormones-GH-releasing hormone(GHRH) and somatostatin. GH stimulates the liver to produce IGF-1, IGF-2 and IGF-binding proteins(IGF-BP). IGF's can also be produced peripherally in various tissues via na autocrine or paracrine mechanism.  IGF-1 blood levels are used by clinicians as a screening test for growth hormone deficiency and excess(as in Acromegaly and Gigantism).  The levels of GH and IGF-1 in the circulation have been seen to vary considerably.To complicate it further, interpretation of IGF-1 levels display wide normal ranges.       Factors that are known to cause variations in the blood levels of growth hormone (GH) and IGF-1 include: - age, sex, race, genetic make-up, stress levels, the time of day, nutritional level,exercise status, disease states, estrogen status and body mass index (BMI).Many of the hormones including sex hormones also influence the GH-IGF axis.  In recent years, xenobiotic intake is being talked about as a factor influencing GH-IGF status.  Thus, the first (and perhaps, crucial) question that should be answered in your case is whether your body fat is the main contributor for your excess weight or your muscle mass. If it happens to be the fat, then GH excess as a cause becomes less likely.The very minimal elevation of IGF should be interpreted with caution(as explained above).  I note from your profile that you have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome(belongs to a group of rare genetic disorders caused by a defect in collagen synthesis). A number of research studies on the effects of human growth hormone in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome have been conducted in the hope of finding any beneficial effects on the collagen bundles and elastic tissue fibers. Results so far, have not been encouraging.  I feel that you should take guidance from an endocrinologist who can assess you first hand and plan further workup as deemed necessary. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Taking Radio Active Iodine When I am Allergic to Shellfish",
    "content": "I was recently diagnosed with hyperthyroidism.   My T4 level was 523 in Sept. stable in Oct. and 650 something in November.  I took the uptake with iodine with a prescription of pretizone and benedryl.  I did not react.  But, I am allergic and since I have had reactions before my doctor was warry of having me take the one time radiation pill because of the amount of iodine.  So, she recommended surgery.  I am terrified.  I had a horrible time with the C-Section I had with my son who's going to be 4 soon.  I also do not numb.   The spinal they gave me did not work.  I had to have a specialist flown in from Cleveland to put me out right before the c-section.  And I did not numb when I had a wisedom tooth removed.  They shoot me 6 times and I still felt it.  I even passed out on my way to pay for the service because of the shock of feeling all that pain. What are my options here?  I want to have another baby as soon as I can.  But I'm afraid the radiation will stop that from happening.  And with the surgery, I have state issued medical insurance so it took two months to see an actual endocrinologist.  I'm terrified they will get a regular surgeon and not a skilled neck and throat doctor to help me since my insurance isn't all that great.  Please let me know.  Any advice is appreciated!!  Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Taking Radio Active Iodine When I am Allergic to Shellfish",
    "content": "Hi, Radioactive iodine (RAI) is unique in that it is taken up selectively by functioning thyroid tissue only.  Very small amounts of iodine uptake may transiently occur in the salivary glands, stomach, and ovaries/testicles.   Radioactive iodine may thus affect a woman's ovaries, and some women may have menstrual irregularities for up to an year after treatment. Many clinicians recommend that women should avoid pregnancy for 6 months to preferably an year following treatment. No ill effects have been observed in offspring of parents who received radioactive iodine in the past.  Miscarriage rates have been seen to increase(double) following RAI treatment.Some long term followup studies have shown that RAI did not appear to have an effect on subsequent pregnancies and offspring over a 10-year follow-up period after RAI. Miscarriage rates seemed to be non-dose dependent. There is also a possibility of slightly earlier age of menopause.  Many types of seafood may contain iodine. However, \"IgE antibody mediated seafood allergy\" has never been ascribed to iodine, but rather to certain specific proteins in fish and shellfish (e.g.,tropomyosin, parvalbumin). These proteins do not contain iodine. Thus, fish or shellfish allergy does not automatically mean a sensitivity/allergy to iodine. (Sampson HA, Food allergy. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2003 Feb;111(2 Suppl):S540-7).  Radiocontrast media (RCM) containing organic iodine may cause adverse reactions such as bronchospasm, laryngospasm,  urticaria, angioedema,  & shock. These reactions are \"anaphylactoid\" in nature and not IgE mediated. Higher osmolar radiocontrast agents seem to cause more reactions.Therefore these reactions lack any iodine-specific reactivity.  In your case,with this information on hand, you should discuss the pros and cons of surgery vs RAI treatment with your surgeon and take an informed decision. Good luck!\n\n",

My voice has deepened since high school as well, I am also concerned about my chest. I have a lack of muscle and more fat in my pectoral area, even after losing 50lbs last summer, I did not notice a change in the size of my chest. From my reading I should be fully complete with puberty but I feel that I might have some sort of pituitary or gonadotropic issue.

    "title": "Low Testosterone, Low FSH/LH, Low SHBG what?",
    "content": "I've been dealing with chronic depression and most of its effects for a long time, seems like since I was 11 or 12.(Don't really feel anything, don't get sad or happy, I don't get excited or nonplussed, I simply am... apparently. almost got in a car wreck twice in the same minute yesterday, felt nothing. my GF was in the car with me and was terrified and her heart was racing, I'm pretty sure I was still 98/59.). I have no drive, hardly any energy. I'm overweight though not nearly as much as I used to be(dropped 39 lbs in a month mysteriously, in April), I weigh 188 right now and am 5'10.   So, after nearly 10 years of attempting to get treatment for my depression and its symptoms from psychiatric and psychologists (medication never worked, I tried Wellbutrin, zoloft, prozac, lexapro and celexa and nothing changed except for receiving the bad side effects of those medications). I went to a family doctor and had them take blood tests specifically for testosterone and thyroid levels.  So, that was in october 2009. At the time my testosterone was around 200. Subsequent testing (3 times since then) it has been floating around ~320.   During this time, I finally started testosterone treatment with the Andreogen patches in april, after a month of use and no difference, the doctor gave me a 400 MG(I think MG?) shot of testosterone esther. And after that, no effects either.  Well, I got my next shot (this time 300, after reading the reference material my doctor had on hypogonadism and treatment, which clearly stated the 400mg shot was not biologically effective(Bonus points for reading this part while the nurse gave me the shot)), and still nothing. I've read that it generally can take up to 2 days to feel effects of the shot, but after nearly 2 months of this I've got nothin.   I got my blood tested again on monday, they checked FSH/LH, SHBG, Testosterone, Estrogen, and Free iron/Iron levels (my request).  This afternoon they called me and let me know that my SHBG levels were low(10), and that this can be corrected generally by weight loss.   So, since I'm pretty inquisitive, I looked up what SHBG did and what the effects of low SHBG are. I was pretty surprised to find that it apparently controls the levels of free testosterone in the body, or atleast contributes. So a low SHBG would generally cause higher free testosterone(which is the only testosterone in the body that actually stimulates or binds with cells, right?).  To my doctor, prior to this, she made it seem like SHBG could be the cause for me having low testosterone(not just free but overall), and fixing SHBG would fix my testosterone.  After reading up on it myself, It seems to not be the case unless I'm grossly misunderstanding something.   Anyway, I apologize for the long post... I'm pretty concerned is all and wanted to explain everything as detailed as possible.  So, my question is : Why is my testosterone low? a low SHBG and testosterone seems hypocritical to me. I also don't see how a higher SHBG would in anyway benefit my issue with low testosterone, in fact It seems like it would worsen it by binding what little free testosterone I have and thus making it biologically inactive.  Otherwise, I'm here to see what I can do about this and who I should see. I'm moving to washington state soon and was planning on attending the swedish neuroscience institutes pituitary center, but I'm not really sure it's a pituitary issue.   In the meantime, I'd love some advice I could bring to my doctor to have her test or what ever... maybe even some insight into what my issue could be and if there is any light at the end of the tunnle  Sincerely, andy.\n\n",

I was just wondering if there is some sort of emotional support for women especially who are going through endocrine problems such as progesterone deficiency or dysmenhorrea or severe PMS.  I know through the years I have felt so unstable, like I want to be nice and I'm trying to be nice but I'm completely out of control.  It has probably contributed to my depression and social anxiety, because my reality is abnormal.  My reality is ungrounded.  I'm really a nice person.  But I have taken to being in the background because I cannot reliably deal with the stress and conflict management in any given nonprofit group, for example.  I love volunteering, but find myself withdrawing because I can be very critical of others but can't seem to explain the criticism of the idea or topic without hurting others feelings.  I admit there are a lot of issues here.  I'm married to an addict, which doesn't help (I'm codependent), but I think a lot of women find themselves in a situation where they think they are a bad person because they don't feel like they can control their \"bitchiness\".  Do you have any tips or resources for us women in this situation?\n\n",

    "content": "Up until a month ago I have never had any health issues. Then one day I woke up with an extreme thrist, then a few days later I started experiencing strong headaches. I went to the doctor and had my blood drawn. They concluded that I didn't have Diabetes. I then saw a Nephrologist and, after tests, he diagnosted my with Diabetes Insipidus. I have been taking the nasal spray treatment of DDAVP and it seemed to help with the thirst, but my headaches never went away. I also had an MRI that didn't show any brain tumors or anything abnormal with my pituitary gland. I was later seen by a Endocrinologist and he told me that he doesn't believe I have Diabetes Insipidus and gave me the pill of DDAVP to use instead of the nasal spray. He also had me get more blood drawn and saw that my blood sugar was low as well as my potassium. A week ago my muscles and joints started to ache terribly bad. What could have caused this sudden outbreak of symptoms and chronic headaches (which still affect me everyday)? Could it be the low potassium, and if so, what could cause the low levels of potassium (todays level was 3.2)?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Diabetes Insipidus, low potassium, chronic headaches",
    "content": "Hi, Diabetes insipidus(DI) may be caused by    1. a defect in Anti-diuretic hormone production, or    2. a defect in the kidneys' response to ADH. Usually the patients with Diabetes insipidus  pass >3litres/24 hours of low osmolality (<300 mOsmol/kg) urine.  Defects in Anti-diuretic hormone production may arise from conditions affecting the hypothalamus/posterior pitutary (cranial or central DI). Defect in the kidneys' response to ADH is called as Nephrogenic DI.  Causes of Diabetes insipidus may be - Acquired or - Idiopathic.  The causes of the aquired DI are..  Tumours: germinomas, craniopharyngiomas, hypothalamic metastases,  hypothalamic gliomas, lymphomas, & large pituitary tumours with suprasellar involvement. Trauma: Head injury, Intracranial surgery. Granulomata: tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Wegener's,& histiocytosis. Infections: meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess Vascular disorders:  Sheehan's syndrome (post-partum pituitary necrosis),aneurysms, haemorrhage/thrombosis & sickle-cell disease. Radiotherapy induced damage. Inherited disorders: Autosomal recessive [ex; a combination of diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, deafness (DIDMOAD) - Wolfram syndrome] & Autosomal dominant(Mutations of vasopressin gene).  Causes of Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: chronic renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, lithium toxicity, and tubulo-interstitial disease & rarely, diabetes mellitus.  Differential diagnosis: - Osmotic diuresis (Diuretic abuse, Diabetes mellitus, hypercalcemia, Hypokalemia, and high-output renal failure) and - Psychogenic polydipsia (PP).  You have indicated that your MRI was normal. In this situation, one needs to consider the following possibilities. - chronically low potassium levels leading to a DI-like state, - conditions that sometimes may not show up readily on MRIs of the brain, such as Histiocytosis, & - the rare inherited causes of DI.  Langerhans cell hisitocytosis (adult onset) deserves special mention in this context. Not all patients with Langerhans cell hisitocytosis develop Diabetes Insipidus.  Estimates vary from 5% to 50%, with an average of 30% of cases. Whole body MRI used for diagnosis(bony lesions). Presentation can be a single site or multi site involvement. Single site involvement of the posterior pitutary is known to occur.Multi site presentations are generally easier to diagnose.  I hope this information is useful to try and understand the difficulties in arriving at a specific etiology of Diabetes Insipidus in some cases.Please continue to be in touch with your endocrinologist who will be able to guide you better.

    "content": "Hello, This could be related to hormones as our entire bodies operate through the release of various hormones.  They are not all from the sex organs but thyroid and pituitary also affect your well-being and bodily functions.  A general physical exam might be in order to check these functions.  Hypothyroid is a very common endocrine disorder.  The change in period is to be expected after stopping oral contraceptives. Whether or not you have endocrine dominance is hard to say.  Some feel that we all have this to one degree or another since there is so much estrogen in the environment.  Your doctor can determine if you do not have enough progesterone to balance the estrogen.  I would not expect this to be likely in someone your age, however.  Most often we see this associated with women closer to the age of menopause.  You might enjoy reading When Your Body Gets the Blues by Marie-Annette Brown and Jo Robinson.  Some of your symptoms are addressed in this book that uses a more natural approach to hormone function and problems.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: TESTOSTORONE LAB RESULTS",
    "content": "Hi, In general, in patients who are on testosterone therapy,   It is important that a blood sample be obtained at the correct time based on the pharmacokinetics of the preparation. For transdermal gels which are applied on a daily basis, blood sampling for testosterone measurement at any time of the day is quite satisfactory.   At the start of therapy with long-acting parenteral formulations (ie, testosterone enanthate in oil), measurements at a mid-way timepoint between injections and just before the next injection is satisfactory & assures a level that is neither too high nor too low.   Once the ideal dose for a given patient is established, then measurements can be done infrequently (perhaps once in every 6-12 months). prostate-specific antigen(PSA) can also be measured concurrently.  I am not aware as to how long you have been on injectable testosterone & what dosing intervals you have been advised. Without these details, it is rather difficult for one to offer an interpretation of the testosterone levels. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "i am 16 and i was wondering if u could help me.  i have been very tired and have very little energy every day.  i was a sick baby so this is nothing new.  i have had joinjt pain ever since i can remember. i have been on synthroid 25mcg since nov. 2009 for hypothyroidism and i feel a little better but i still never feel good.  My symptoms are:  frequent migraines, constant joint and muscle pain, sensitivity to touch (everything hurts me), trouble sleeping due to pain, extreme sensitivity to cold, very sore throat for over 3 years now, frequent viruses and strep throat (but my throat hurts all the time, not just when i have strep), swollen lymph nodes, salmon colored rash on legs that comes and goes and is sometimes on my shoulders too, fevers as high as 106.3 and a temperature as low as 91.2.  i can't do anything fun like go to Disneyland without getting a lot of pain and either a very high or very low temperature.  Last time we went i had a lot of trouble breathing and it wasn't asthma.  i just felt like i couldn't get a breath and it stayed that way all night.  in the morning i could breathe again.  My mom thinks my thyroid is not under control with the synthroid even tho my blood tests say it is.  she wants me on armour, from real pigs - yuck.  is it worth trying?  could it be my adrenal gland?  my thyroid?  some doctors say i have arthritis and one says i don't even tho i have a positive rh factor.    i am getting very tired of constantly resting on the couch.  i have been homeschooled for the past 4 years bcuz i am too sick to go to school, and i really want to be a teacher.  i want to go to college starting next fall.  oh yeah, and i throw up about twice a month.   i have never been overweight.  i have extreme sensitivity to light.  yeah, that's about it,  i think.\n\n",

I had my thyroid partialy removed and then \"killed\" with radiation several years ago and now am taking 300mcg of levoxyl, no fun and I still feel lke dirt.

    "content": "Hi, I've been experiencing unusual fatigue and brain fog for past few months. Noticed that I also have blurred vision and very cold hands and feet at the same time. Quite often I experienced heart palpitations and fast heartbeat even at rest. During this period, I also wake up more frequently in the night without any particular reason, though I don't have problem falling asleep. As a result I don't feel refreshed after waking up and have trouble concentrating at work.  I'm quite certain this is not due to depression, though these symptoms do make me feel depressed at times :(  Went through thyroid test (TSH 0.9) and other blood tests that seems normal. Also did ultrasound for my heart and found no valve leakages. However, I did compared my blood test result done recently with the one done in 2008, and found a decline in wbc (2008: 5.35, Now: 4.8) and platelet count (2008: 190, Now: 165). Could this decline in wbc and platelet indicate something? My symptoms also resembles thyroid disorder but doc says TSH within normal range. I'm confused.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I note from your profile that you had pneumothorax in the past and had undergone surgery for the same.  What was the cause of this pneumothorax?. What kind of surgery was done? Any part of the lung was removed?. Had the lung fully expanded following the surgery?. These details are very pertinent in your case assessment.  The symptoms that you mention can be attributed to a number of illnesses including the ones you suspect.But,a meaningful conclusion can be arrived at, only after thoroughly examining and investigating you.  Again i would like to point out to you the importance of the thoracic surgery that you had gone through. Disorders leading to hypercarbia(increased partial pressure of CO2 in the blood) +/- hypoxia(low oxygen tension in the blood) are capable of manifesting the symptoms that you allude to.  The serial changes in the blood counts that you have mentioned do not seem to be very significant, but will be certainly co-related with the overall picture.   I urge you to consult your thoracic surgeon who, will be better placed to assess you and sort out these symptoms. Good day!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: high cortisol low DHEA due to meds?",
    "content": "Hi, I will try to provide you some information about the much talked about connection between spirnolactone and cortisol.  Certain drugs are known to lead to apparently increased cortisol levels. Examples include the diuretic spironolactone and estrogen hormones. Low cortisol levels may be caused by drugs such as androgens or the anti-epileptic medication phenytoin.  The Fluorimetric assay (Mattingly,1962) was the commonly used assay to measure serum cortisol levels.Reports of high levels of serum cortisol levels in spirnolactone treated individuals began to be reported by several studies in the 1970's.  But, experimental studies showed that the administration of spironolactone to cortisol-producing animals such as the guinea pig and the dog, caused a 50 to 80% loss of microsomal cytochrome P-450 with a concomitant decrease in the activity of the microsomal 17-hydroxylase in their adrenals & a DECREASE in the serum cortisol.  Sometime later,it was realized that some metabolic by-product or additive in the commonly used brand of spirnolactone may be interfering with the measurement of cortisol by the Fluorimetric assay and causing the 'apparent' raised levels. The source of interference was presumed to be either the dyes used to colour the tablets or magnesium stearate.  The composition of the aforesaid tablet was changed after May 1964.The 'newer' version also seemed to produce similar results, but to a much lesser extent. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/article ... -0056b.pdf  Hope this information may be useful to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Chronic Heat Exhaustion Susceptibility",
    "content": "I've run into a few questions and answers on the web which suggest I am not alone in this problem. However, I cannot find a good explanation for my problem.  I started getting heat exhaustion when I was about 7 years old. I distinctly remember the first time it happened. After running around the yard in the summer, having a blast, I was forced to come inside and spend what felt like an eternity laying on the linoleum floor in front of a giant fan, sometimes getting up to hurl over the toilet.  I was a healthy child of an average weight. I was probably unable to recognize the warning signs of heat exhaustion at a young age, but I continued to develop heat exhaustion when other people or children had no issues. This happened particularly in warm climates but not necessarily during extreme exercise. Yes, I drank water.  There is a misunderstanding out there that the more water you drink, the less likely you are to develop heat exhaustion. I now understand we need sodium and other electrolytes to regulate water in our bodies. I know that drinking more than 3 liters of water a day makes me feel sick, and the recommended amounts for high heat or exercise have not helped me to prevent heat exhaustion. Even when taken in small amounts throughout the day, I was sure that this much water just threw off my body's regulation even worse. I have tried using electrolyte mixes, and they seem to help, but of course do not solve the problem.  As I frequently spend a lot of my work week exercising outdoors, I am careful about drinking plenty of water, keeping my sodium intake at the recommended levels when the weather is hot, and taking breaks when I feel the heat rising. During the summer when it is around 90-100 degrees, it seems conditions (water intake, etc) have to be just right, or I have to take shade breaks as often as I work. This is true even when I am exercising but not out of breath.  I have also found that even when I am drinking what seems to be the necessary amount of water, I will still have the need to urinate, even as others working in the same conditions are sweating it all out and still not becoming dehydrated but do not need to urinate nearly as much. This is the most baffling part of all this, because if I've had enough water in my system that my body has the need to expel it, why am I developing heat exhaustion?  It may be that this is a symptom of some other unrecognized health problem that may be hereditary. My mother says she had similar issues when she was a kid, but it went away with childhood. This is clearly not going away for me, but I am much more active. As an adult, I have no health concerns, am generally active and fit, though overweight according to BMI. Excess fat probably doesn't make this easier on my body, but it seems there is more to this than losing 20 pounds. I have been tested for diabetes and kidney problems, but I do not seem to have any health issues.  Is it possible that this is a problem with sodium balance? Are there other things that might be causing this? What else can I do besides stay in shape and drink the recommended amount of water? Could this be a kidney problem?\n\n",

    "content": "I had a transphendoidal hypophysectomy in 1982 and 2 subsequent sinus/pituitary sugeries (2005, 2006) to remove a solidified fungal mass occupying the space where the tumor had been removed. I subsequently was found to have osteomyelitis that occured during the later surgery, requiring a fourth debridement in that region in 2007. I have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. I force myself to do 40 min. of exercise daily for the fibro and the arthritis and then I battle to do anything else, including to try not to fall asleep during the rest of the day. I have sleep disorder and a year ago began having syncopal episodes with all brain/neck MRIs/MRAs/CT scans, tilt table testing, echocardiograms, EKGs, 30 day event monitors, treadmill cardiac stress testing and serum testing pointing to neurocardiogenic syncope. My cardiologists started me on florinef q 12 hours. I am on prednisone for osteoarthritis. When explaining the Autonomic Nervous System dysfunction, my cardiologist wanted to know more about the osteomylitis and prior to that asked me if I'd ever seen an endocrinologist (before I went into debth about that part of my health history). I had been thoroughly tested for adrenal insuffciency (plus the thyroid and other hormone levels) by my endocrinologist 3 years ago and he assured me that everything was 'functioning'. I did not have (or need to have a ACTH stimulation test according to him). My cardiologist insists I go back to the endocrinologist and he was calling my PCP, and writing my PCP, my infectious disease doctor and my endocrinologist. Incidentally, I had seen the endocrinologist 3 years ago at the insistance of my sinus surgeon who'd consulted with a specialist and was convinced at my exams during repeated severe sinusitis and bronchitis (that at one incident progressed to pneumonia) that my pituitary or adrenal gland was not producing sufficiently. Is it possible to develop this anomally this far out of surgery and do I need to be off these medications and for how long, before testing can be done? Thank you for your assistance.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 57 year female diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and hypothyroidism (said to be secondary to a \"sluggish\" HPA axis due to FMS).  Lab tests are normal except for an elevated LDL;  DHEA and DHEA-S have been elevated at times (DHEA 676 ng/dL; normal= 69-414) and  normal at other times; FSH and testosterone are normal, IGF-1 is normal, 24 hour catecholamines+VMA is normal.  A CT of the abdomen shows \"no evidence of adrenal neoplasm\".  Brain MRI is normal, thyroid ultrasound and thyroid antibodies are normal.    I continue to have panic attacks and paroxsmal atrial fibrillation (determined by holter monitor) as well as very oily skin/acne, excessive hair growth on face, fatigue and unrefreshed sleep (despite using a CPAP for sleep apnea and low dose doxepin, which stops me from multiple awakenings during the night), muscle pain and joint stiffness and a whole host of other FMS symptoms.    I am on 50 mcg Unithroid and 10mg doxepin.  Various meds for Fibromyalgia and chronic pain such as Lyrica, Cymbalta, Topamax, and SSRIs are not effective for pain and cause myriad side effects including weight gain, agitation and worsening of muscle tightness as well as SSRI intolerance (anxiety, muscle tightness, disturbed sleep even at very low doses on Lexapro, Effexor, Cymbalta).  Often I \"crash\" in the afternoons, similar to the symptoms of adrenal fatigue.    Do you think the elevated DHEA is causing my panic attacks and palpitations as well as the other symptoms?  An endocrinologist consulted says it's due to \"stress\" and not to worry, but I wonder if my DHEA and DHEA-S should be re-tested and treated if found to be elevated again.  It has been elevated several times over several years, though the levels that the endocrinologist tested were normal.    I would greatly appreciate advice especially as elevated DHEA relates to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia.  Thank you.  Csel\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Elevated DHEA, normal abdominal CT",
    "content": "Hi, DHEA is Dehydroepiandrosterone is a precursor of the sex hormones. It is secreted by the \"Zona reticularis\" which is the deepest layer of the adrenal cortex.The other hormone produced in this layer is Androstenedione, which is the common precursor of the male & female sex hormones. DHEA gets sulfated & gets converted to DHEA-S. Both these(DHEA-S and  Androstenedione) can not be cestes/ovaries to be further processed into the sex hormones.  DHEA levels usually begin to decline after the age of 30 at a rate of about 2% per year. By age 70, they are at about 20% of their peak levels.  DHEA in stress: DHEA helps prevent the destruction of 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). 5-HTP increases the production of serotonin. This helps provide added protection from chronic stress. Several studies have shown that low DHEA may be a biological marker of stress & age-related diseases such as neurosis, depression etc.   DHEA is seen to be very low in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).  This is explained as follows: To begin with, chronic stress causes the adrenal glands to release extra cortisol as a normal response to stress. Continuing stress raises cortisol to abnormally high levels. Thereafter, the adrenal glands get exhausted. As the cortisol levels continue to become depleted, the adrenal glands try to compensate by releasing more DHEA. Eventually they become so exhausted that they can\u2019t produce enough of either cortisol or DHEA.  If indeed you have fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) ahd your DHEA and DHEA-S values are elevated, one explanation for this might be that your adrenals have not yet exhausted their ability to synthesize these substances.

On detection of an adrenal incidentaloma, one needs to answer the following questions:     1.Is it really an adrenal or extra-adrenal mass?    2.Is it possible that it is a metastasis from an unknown or  known primary tumor?    3.Is it hormonally active(secreting)?    4.Is it possible that it is an adrenocortical carcinoma?  If it is fairly certain that it is an adrenal  'incidentaloma', the following assume importance: - size of the lesion, - whether it is secreting any hormones (functioning) or non-secreting (non-functioning). - if functioning, which hormone is being secreted?  If an incidentaloma is functioning, depending on the hormone secreted, various confirmatory tests will be needed. This aspect will not be discussed further here.  Generally speaking,  - larger the lesion, higher are the chances of it being malignant, - for most secreting tumors, surgery is the right option.   Therfore, all tumors > 6 cm should be surgically removed. All hormonally active incidentalomas must also be surgically removed to prevent serious morbidity. This approach is well accepted for pheochromocytomas and Conn's adenomas. Controversies exist as to whether all patients with subclinical Cushing's syndrome benefit from adrenal surgery, as progress of subclinical disease to overt Cushing\u00b4s syndrome seems to occur only in a minority of cases.  Role of FNA:  In patients with adrenal incidentaloma and no history of malignancy, FNA has not proven to be beneficial, as cytologic differentiation between benign and malignant adrenal tumors is difficult.    Follow-up: of patients with nonfunctional adrenal mass shows that only 5-30% of masses increase in size.Follow up imaging study is recommended 6 \u2013 12 month after initial evaluation. Further follow up studies are not considered necessary, since tumor growth becomes \u201cstable\u201d by that time.   If definite tumor growth is seen on follow-up imaging, surgical removal of the tumor is recommended. Surgical removal of suspicious tumors >3 cm or even 2 cm has been recommended by some.  The advancements in imaging techniques (CT and MRI) in characterization of adrenal masses is expected to restrict FNA to a very few indications.  Following a careful workup, it is now possible for the endocrine surgeons to be reasonably confident in their decision to operate or observe an adrenal incidentaloma in the majority of cases.  Surgery, if indicated, can be - the traditional 'open' approach, or - a laparoscopic approach((transabdominal or retroperitoneal).  The lesion in your kidney most likely is another incidentaloma (renal). As details regarding its details on imaging (solid or cystic etc) are not mentioned, i will refrain from discussing it further here. However,there have been reports in the literature of renal cell carcinomas metastasizing to the adrenals.   Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "from euthyroid to hypothyroid while on levothyroxine",
    "content": "Hi,  I'm 47 with a dx of Grave's Disease in '93, treated with RAI 131 and subsequently became hypothyroid 4 months later.  I have had successful treatment for the most part with synthroid then levoxyl or levothyroxine keeping my TSH between 0.3 to 2.0 but clinically feeling best at <2. Back in nov'09 I was dx with hyperparathyroidism, found to have 1 adenoma, had 1 and a half parathyroids removed.  Follow-up labs showed all my levels to be mostly within range.(PTH, ionized CA, TSH)  TSH = 0.05 while on 200 mcg of levothyroxine.  For the most part I felt pretty good but my doc felt best to decrease my medication to 175 mcg.  That dose was started at the end of february '10.   Well I finally got rechecked and to all of our dismay my TSH was 19.0.  no wonder I have been extremly constipated, brittle nails, losing tons of hair, very dry skin, extremly dry skin.  My dose was just changed back to 200mcg. Something else just started with me that I never experienced.... a firm large swelling/lump over or under the medial clavicle extends closely towards substernal notch on the left side.  It is painful but feels almost like nerve pain not  lump pain.  Pain shoots towards shoulder, chest area and up neck into ear.  Chest xray and lt clavicle xray are all normal.   Is there any correlation between the sudden large increase in TSH / this lump with anything else like .....  thyroid cancer? Thanks I could really use some advise on this.  I feel like the ER doctors are very quick to say \"no fracture\" nothings wrong.  I don't think I mentioned that I have never had an injury to this area (shoulder, clavicle, neck) nor did I recently injure it.  It just came out of no where.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: from euthyroid to hypothyroid while on levothyroxine",
    "content": "Hi, Your concern is indeed well founded.  Excluding thyroid neoplasms is important in patients with Graves' disease because reports have shown that differentiated thyroid cancer is probably more common in these patients and may also run a more aggressive course.  Most of the studies which show the above finding were surgical, and the patients were selected for surgery on the basis of suspicious nodules or large goiters. In patients with Graves' disease treated by radioactive iodine, no subsequent increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer has been reported.  Generally, diagnosing thyroid cancer in Graves' disease is not easy. If a malignant nodule is palpable, then it is far easier.Increasing use of ultrasonography and FNAC may help to increase detection rates.     Parathyroid adenomas have been reported in a small % of patients with thyroid cancer.Conversely, 3-10% of patients with parathyroid adenomas also have thyroid cancer . Exposure to ionizing radiation in the past may explain this association in some cases.  The swelling near the clavicle (? lymph node) that you had felt needs to be promptly assessed by a surgeon.In all probability, the rising TSH value following dose reduction of thyroxin is not indicative of an underlying throid cancer. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: hypothyroid and weightgain",
    "content": "Hi, Hypothyroidism can be  - congenital or  - aquired.  Congenital hypothyroidism is sporadic.This is due to congenital agenesis or dysgenesis of the thyroid gland.  Some of the causes of aquired hypothroisism are: - Medications(interleukin-2,interferon alpha,lithium,amiodarone etc), - Autoimmune disease (Subacute thyroiditis, hashimoto's thyroiditis), - post-operative: (removal of part or all of the thyroid gland),  - Too little or too much dietary iodine, - pituitary Dysfunction (post surgery,radiation,trauma etc), - Rare infiltrative disorders of the thyroid(ex;hemochromatosis, amyloidosis & sarcoidosis),  - Radiation treatment( irradiation to the neck, I131ablation of thyroid).   When a number of closely related people in a family are affected, it is tempting to call it 'familial'. This kind of a 'familial' pattern may be due to - instances wherein, persons in a family are exposed to some environmental factors (ex:dietary goitrogens), - truely familial cases (where, a familial pattern is seen - but, no genetic abnormality has yet been identified. An example of this is familial hashimoto's disease)), or - heriditary cases (where a genetic abnormality has been identified).  There are a number of genetic causes of hypothyroidism reported. - Familial thyroid dyshormonogenesis:  inborn errors of thyroid hormone synthesis, secretion, or uptake Hypothyroidism which are autosomal recessive disorders.  - Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) unresponsiveness: It is a ery rare autosomal dominant disorder.Laboratory findings usually show  raised serum TSH, low to normal serum thyroxine, and low radioactive iodine uptake. Goitre is usually not seen.   - Hereditary hypothyroidism due to TSH deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease. Symptoms of severe mental and growth retardation is seen in the affected individuals. These severe consequences can be prevented by early administration of exogenous thyroid hormone.  In your case one may proceed in the following way: - first to exclude environmental factors. - If no enviromental factors are identifiable, then one must try to exclude familial hashimoto's disease. If this is negative, then - one must look for the rare heriditary causes.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Could Zinc be causing me to Sweat ALL of the time?",
    "content": "I really hope someone here can help me. I will try to give as much info as possible, but it may be long. Sorry and thank you in advance.  I am 34 years old. My current medications are Necon 1/50 birth control pills which I only go off of every 4 months (I skip the inactive the first 3 months). I am also prescribed Oxycodone 5/325 for the cramps. I take about 8 pills every 4 months. I was diagnosed with dysmenorrhea in 1986 and they finally found cysts this year. I was also diagnosed (sort of) this year with a probable ulcer. I am waiting on my GI appt. to confirm. In the meantime, I was prescribed Nexium 40mg twice a day for the first two weeks and I am now taking it once a day.  But none of that, I don't think, is relevant to my question. I THINK I am overdosing on Zinc and want to know if its causing my symptoms. I have been sweating profusely in the neck and head area for the past 2 years. It could be 30 degrees outside and I will still sweat. The ONLY times I don't is if there is a fan blowing in my face OR, strangely, when I take the oxycodone, the sweating stops as well. So, I constantly NEED flowing air. I could be sitting in an air conditioned room where everyone is comfortable, but I have sweat dripping down my forehead, under my nose, back of my hairline, etc. Not only is it embarrassing, its EXTREMELY uncomfortable. You feel like your are breaking a fever ALL THE TIME. I wake up drenched in sweat around my neck every single night and have to get up around 2-3am to wash up and change my shirt. Its exhausting. 3 years ago. I was always the cold one. Bundled up until the temp was at least 70 degrees. Now, I can't ever wear sweatshirts. I live in southern NJ and wear t-shirts all year long.   I have been tested for hyper and hypo thyroidism (my mom and grandfather had it), diabetes (grandmom had it) and a host of other things. But no one has checked zinc or copper levels. Why, do you ask, do I suspect zinc and/or copper? Well...  I wear dentures. I inherited bad teeth from my mom (who had dentures at 26) and finally lost the battle with my teeth when I was 32. 2 years ago. I am poor. I can't afford to get new denture or to get my temporary dentures religned (yes, I am using my 2 year old TEMPORARY dentures). So, I apply fixodent control 20 - 30 times each day on the top AND on the bottom so a combined 40 - 60 times a day. I go through a full size tube in about two weeks give or take a few days. The problem, I just noticed on the box that there is zinc in the fixodent. The box states that you get about 4% of your daily Zinc (equiv. to 6oz. of beef) from daily use of fixodent. The problem is, they are basing it on someone applying fixodent ONE to TWO times a DAY. So, if you do the math, I have a real problem on my hands and I've had this problem for 2 years. I've been applying the fixodent like this for 2 years!  I looked up Hydrosis and Cranio-Facial Hydrosis. Unless there is a tumor, its pretty much something your born with. So they don't fit either. The ONLY thing left for me to consider is that the buildup of zinc in my system OR the lack of copper (depletion caused by too much zinc) could be causing this sweating. Is this possible? Can anyone think of ANY other things to test for? I seriously feel like I'm living in a nightmare and can't wake up. I can't live like this anymore. PLEASE PLEASE try to help. I don't know what else to look for.  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,As far as I know there is no evidence connecting hyperzincaemia or hypocupremia to hyperhidrosis. Excessive sweating can be primary or secondary.The secondary causes would include tuberculosis,malignancy,neurologic disorders,and menopause. The commoner and primary are the palmoplantar sweating,axillary,and craniofacial types in that order. Primary hyperhidrosis could be focal or generalised. From your history the condition seem to fit cranifacial of the primary type. The treatment modalities in recent times would include minimally invasive  video assisted endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy as a surgery, and more recently external application of Glycopyrrolate.

There's too little else to go on to make even an educated guess here, beyond the fact that kidney/adrenal problems need to be ruled out.  Good luck to you with this.

    "content": "Over the past two years I've had the same symptoms, the last was immediately after walking during a thalium stress test.  This usually occurs when I am suddenly upset, but it has occasionaly happened when I have been exercising.  In my most recent episode I had just finished walking on the teadmill and had laid down on the table.  The ECG was still running.  The pain subsided within two minutes.  At the time I told the tech about the pain, but he apparently failed to acknowledge/record those symptoms (my doctor said it was not recorded in the report.).  Nevertheless, there was nothing amiss in the actual ECG recording or the other stress test results.  My cardiologist has ordered a CT scan of the abdominal and pelvic regions.  If nothing shows up in these tests he said he may order a heart cath study to see if it is a partially blocked artery.  He said that a stress test is only 85% accurate and that in some cases angina symptoms are felt in the back as opposed to the chest.  I told him I had heard the pain usually accompanying angina was described as \"squeezing,\" and I would not describe the pain I was having as squeezing.  I had a coronary stent placed about five years ago, and he wants to be sure no blockage has occured. If that study is clean I will talk with a renologist or urologist about the issue.  If nothing shows up after all these tests, one solution will be to take a beta blocker that will block the effect of the adrenaline.  Of course, that is one of the medicines you are not supposed to take before any kind of stress tests since it affects the results.  Nevertheless, if taken before an anxiety producing situation it will reduce the effects of the adrenalin rush.\n\n",

My TSH is lesser than 0.019 and my t4 is 20 now which has been flacutating between 30-20 of t4 for the past 11 months.  My concern is i have high ESR.  I took blood test mid of last year and it was 28, early of this year 35 and 2 months ago 50.  Now it has become 62.  I wonder why i have such a high ESR and is increasing.  Earlier of this year, I have some joint pains on my left hand and have seen the rheumatoid specialist but they ruled out of me having aritithies after the blood test.  However I don't have any problem with the joints of my left hand now.  Both my endocrin and rheumatoid specialist said that the joint pains of my hand and hyperthyrodism wouldnt not casue my ESR to be high.  Is this true?  I wonder what is actually happening to me? What other observation must I make? Is there any test and find out what actually is happening to me?  I hope i didnt contract any cancer or any serious disease.  Kindly advise.

    "content": "Hello,  As the title states I am 25 years old and my doctor tells me I am borderline hypothyroid.  I have no symptoms whatsoever and the subclinical diagnosis has not changed each time I have done a blood test to check my TSH levels in 6 month intervals (I have done 3 tests and again nothing has changed nor do I have symptoms).  Since my last appointment which was a few days ago I've been doing some research on subclinical hypothyroidism and heart conditions and I keep reading that subclinical hypothyroidism is related to mild effects on cardio vascular function.  My dr. tells me that this can happen but to older patients, he specifically mentioned that if I was older, 40 or so he would prescribe me medication.  I'd like to confirm this, since I am 25 I have nothing to worry about regarding my heart?  My doctor tells me I have absolutely nothing to worry about, should I get a 2nd opinion?  I'd like to point out as well that my blood pressure is fine, I do not have high cholesterol, and again I have no symptoms. Thank you.\n\n",

This test gives an idea about as to whether active free testosterone is available or is bound to this globulin. Despite normal testosterone levels if the testosterone is mostly bound to globulin it wont be effective.Here SHBG levels would be increased and could cause erectile dysfunction. Conversly if SHBG levels are low indicate that free testosterone is available.Obesity can reduce these levels too apart from hypothyroidsm,and cushings. Hope this answers your question.

Vitamin D deficiency per-se has not conclusively been shown to be the cause of lipodystrophy. But, resistance to insulin &/or vitamin D has been observed in some of the cases. Some types of lipodystrophies may be associated with osteopenia, osteosclerosis and myopathies.  There are a vast variety of syndromes which are associated with non-HIV lipodystrophy.  You will need to be investigated fully before a firm diagnosis is arrived at. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "\"Adrenal Fatigue\" - fact or fiction?",
    "content": "Its going to be difficult to keep this short so bear with me. Before im instantly dismissed, I also need to post a bit of background. Im a comp sci major+statistician, a huge skeptic, critical thinking nerd and reject \"alternative medicine\" type of things without hard core double blind studies to support claims.  Thats said.... I have suffered for 10 years with extreme fatigue due to the incompetence of many GP's who would rather send me on my way with the default declaration of \"depression\" than to spend some time trying to figure out what has actually been wrong with me.  My fatigue has slowly grown over a 10 year period until I finally became completely disabled.  Getting out of bed for more than 15 mins at a time was near impossible.  During these years I had my testosterone levels checked.  Looking at my spreadsheet of blood test results, I now see they had been slowly dropping every year until I fell off the very bottom of the scale.  I was symptomatic of low testosterone when my levels hit 430 (for a 30 year old).  I was suspicious of a low testosterone issue because the symptoms matched so well but my doctors kept telling me I was fine because I was \"in range\".    Then the day came where I finally tested below the bottom of the T scale and was finally put on T replacement. It was like night and day.  It has been discovered that my body requires a T level of at least 550 to feel good again.  (range 350 - 1200).  Here is the part that angers me so much, and applies to ALL blood tests. Too many docs use the lab ranges strictly as a black/white mechanism as a decision point to treat or not treat. Its absolutely ridiculous that one month I could have a T level for 350 and be told im fine, and the very next month a T level of 349, which is below range and get treatment.  We are not binary computers, we are analog machines and each persons optimal level for any given blood test will land on a bell curve somewhere. I may require a 550 T level to feel good.  Or a TSH of 0.7 to feel good, whereas someone else may require a 900 T level to feel good, or may be fine with a TSH of 2.0.  Wheeeeeew... still with me?  Now many doctors dismiss \"adrenal fatigue\" as some kooky myth sold by people who want to sell supplements an don't have real training.  BUT.... keeping the analog human bell curve in mind, it is also absolutely ridiculous to draw a hard line in the sand and claim that if you have cortisol levels below THIS LINE you have addisons and above this line cushings.   Its a grey scale.  If you are just barely above the line for clinical addisons, there is no way you can tell your patient \"oh you are fine\".  Their cortisol levels are clearly sub-optimal and they could very well be symptomatic even though they pass (barely) all the tests for addisons.    Which brings me to my latest discovery.  I have adrenal fatigue, or if you don't like that term because its too often tied to a bunch of hooey, how about \"Hypoadrenalism\"?  It was hard to detect because my morning cortisol was midlevel, but quickly fell below normal by 11am and for the entire test of the day and night.  Which caused my initial thryoid medication to fail and make things worse.  I am also hypothyroid which wasnt discovered until the AACE guidelines were changed a few years ago such that a TSH > 3.0 was considered seriously suspect. Imagine that, one day I wasnt hypothyroid according to my doc with a TSH of 3.2, and the very next day when the new AACE guidelines were published I was!  So I assert \"adrenal fatigue\" or \"\"Hypoadrenalism\" or an \"non-optimal cortisol\" levels, is very real syndrome, it logically has to be. Being 0.01% above the line for addisons, in many cases, cannot be healthy.  So why am I writing this?  IM BEGGING ALL DOCS to stop turning your patients away with a quick hand wave and diagnosis of \"depression\", then try to put them on anti-depressants when you havent done your homework.  I was labeled depressed for 10 years, and it was utter nonsense. Everything in my life was great except for the fact I was so tired I could not live it. I did have secondary depression. How could you not? When you feel that terrible, of course you will be depressed, but depression is not the cause of the symptoms.  TO ALL PATIENTS - never take your docs word as gospel. Being in range for a blood test can *sometimes* mean nothing, especially if you are close to one end of the range.  Play close attention to symptoms and get many 2nd opinions.   I would like to hear from the docs if they agree or disagree, but if you disagree please provide a logical explanation why being .01% above the line for addisons is just fine and not likely an issue that currently lacks a label. (like adrenal fatigue, etc)\n\n",

    "title": "Re: \"Adrenal Fatigue\" - fact or fiction?",
    "content": "Hi, I, at the very outset, declare that my knowledge of statistics at its very nadir! I will share with you some of what little i understand about the so called \"laboratory reference ranges\".  Nowadays, it is preferred to call it as 'reference' range rather than 'normal' range ( because a reference population - a 'normal-appearing' population, can be easily defined than a completely 'normal' population).  The  usual definition of a reference range is- - the set of values 95 percent of the normal population falls within, or two standard deviations from the mean, although this definition may differ.  The reference range is arrived at by testing a large number of 'healthy' people and observing what appears to be \"normal\" for them.For obvious reasons, the laboratory reference range may vary from place to place and between institutions!  References range will vary with age, sex, race, diet, use of prescription or other drugs, stress and even the instruments used to measure a given value. For example if an European citizen happens to fall sick and gets investigated in say africa, his/her blood values may fall out of range(to get the most reliable of results,it would be ideal to be flown back to their home country where the laboratory reference range is likely to be more representative).  Furthermore, reference ranges only denote what are usual values in THAT population, and do not directly correlate with the ranges for optimal health. I agree with you that at times(unfortunately), a patient may get labelled one way or the other. But as it stands now, it may be impractical to find out whether a test result is normal for a particular patient if the result may be slightly out of range.It will be time consuming, may involve repeated testing and may not be affordable by some individuals and may not be cost-effective for even governments. What is recommended by experts in this field however, is that if a test result is out of range, it only indicates that patient should be investigated further - this is different from saying that any value out of range means that patient has a disease.  I empathize with some of your genuine frustrations.  What i can't understand though, is that you say you \"reject alternative medicine\" type of things without hard- core double blind studies to support claims\"--- and yet repeatedlly use the term 'Adrenal Fatigue' which is a terminology still used in some forms of alternative medicine and not by mainstream modern medicine (which prefers the term 'adrenal insufficiency' for the same condition). Thank you for a statistically significant post. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, The abdominal pain that you mention is non-specific and could be due to may causes.  You mention about an unexplained rash which occured sometime in november 2009.  Levothyroxin is known to cause abdominal pain, cramps, nausea and vomiting.Also it is known to cause skin rashes(may be itchy).  Therefore,It may be worth starting with a suspicion of a drug-induced problem (in your case, the levothyroxin). Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Diffuse Fullness of Left Adrenal Gland",
    "content": "Hi, Of late, thanks to the advanced imaging techniques, it is being recognized that the adrenals may be involved in cases of acute pancreatitis and also that they may affect the severity of the pancreatitis as well as prognosis.  Changes in the adrenals have beeen reported in some cases of acute pancreatitis on CT and MRI (adrenal enlargement, hyper-attenuation as well as hypo-attenuation), depending upon the time-frame since onset of acute pancreatitis.  Unilateral as well as bilateral changes have been observed.  These changes are thought to be due to adrenal hemorrhage.  Why hemorrhage should occur and why the adrenals seem to be vulnerable is not yet clear.One hypothesis is listed below...  The head of the pancreas lies close to the right adrenal gland, and the tail lies in front of the left adrenal gland. Pancreas is closely related to both kidneys.Thus, pancreatic inflammation can involve the perirenal spaces.  The exudate which is rich in proteolytic enzymes,cytokines and other inflammatory mediators can penetrate Gerota's fascia and, therefore, come into contact with the adrenal glands themselves.   The precise mechanism by which the pancreatic exudate causes adrenal haemorrhage is not known. The mechanism may not be due to direct involvement. The adrenal gland has a complex arterial supply, in contrast to its limited venous drainage which is critically dependent on a single vein. This pattern of blood supply has been described as a \u2018vascular dam\u2019.   In situations of severe stress (e.g. pancreatitis), adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH) secretion increases, which stimulates adrenal arterial blood flow that may overwhelm the limited venous drainage capacity of the organ, leading to infarction and haemorrhage.  Even bilateral adrenal hemorrhage often does not result in adrenal hypofunction, as atleast 90% of the adrenal cortex needs to be destroyed before adrenal insuffiency occurs.  Thus unilateral adrenal involvement in acute pancreatitis may not result in any overt adrenal insuffiency, but its relationship to overall prognosis in acute pancreatitis is being studied.  I am not sure what caused the lymph nodes in your case. You need a thorough clinical examination and work- up.  Hope this information may be useful to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 23 year old female, but most people think I am younger then 18. Since I was 15-16 I have been getting more body hair which normally are where males get hair, under the navel, and also above the navel towards my chest and around my nipples, also a lot around my bikini line. Around my nipples the hairs seem to be the thickest, there are like 40 hairs, between the breasts some hairs are appearing now to.  It doesnt disturb me thou, I have learned to accept my body in totality. But I do would like to know what can cause this?  I am 1m75 and weigh 60kg, I have a blood test every year and everything is always fine, except my hormones are pretty low. TSH is to low. Althou I don't seem to have an underactive thyroid because I don't get fat. Also my skin turns yellow sometimes, and this is noticable by other people to. My eyes stay white, it is just my skin. My docter thought it was my bilirubine levels in the blood, but on the test they always turned out fine, not high at all.   My menstruation at this moment is regular, but it has been irregular before, but it was because I was thinner then. In winter I mostly gain some weight. It doesnt cause me any trouble, menstruation does not give me pain or anything.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Doctor,  I've just recently been diagnosed with a Prolactinoma my levels were up in the 4800 and also low testosterone, im am 24 and since i was about 19 ive felt my whole body going down hill.  I first started to develop Bier spots that have gotten more permanent over time but less prominent, and then i began to get a lump under my left nipple that was sore.  Then i gained a lot of weight, developed Seb Dermatitis and my hair thinned diffusely all over in certain areas.  The lump dissappeared around a year later but when it went i was left with what looks like a small perky boob, if touch/squeeze it feels like a water balloon with no lump or anything.  I have been put on Cabergoline x2 a week for the prolactinoma and im starting to eat a lot less and losing weight which seemed impossible before my diagnosis despite living a very active life, but the more wieght i lose the more the puffy left nipple stands out.  I am living in the uk and it takes 5-6 months to see my Endocronoligist and my next appointment is march, but i really don't want to keep getting down about this till then.  Can my hairloss be caused by the prolactinoma itself ? and the dermatitis just ran along side at the same time ? and is gynecomstia caused by prolactinoma different from normal gynecomstia ? and what can i do to fix this ?  thanks    Kevin\n\n",

    "content": "This is my first post here and to start off I am not trying to self diagnose. I just like to be kept well informed. And well would like to see if maybe these choices are then ones that fit.  To Start I am a 38 yr Diabetic at approx 425lbs, I just recently had a debriment surgery and for an existing leg wound which was found to have a staph infection on top of it. I was given a broad spectrum antibiotic and the Staph infection was cleared. I was then operated on to have the debreminent surgery performed and then a negative pressure wound vac applied. Then graft is in place and we is doing wonderfully. When I was released from the hospital I was given Keflex which I had an allergic reaction to. I went to the ER and was given 50mg of Benadryl and it took care of the reaction. The thing is i then started having anxiety/ panic attacks. I was told that this was due to High BP and was placed on a low dose Benicar ( 20/12 ) this didnot lower enough so it was then increased to 40/12 as well as being given the Xanax to use as need at 1mg. For a while i was doing great, but now I am getting in office BP of 90/80 and at one point 80/60 was told to report to the ER, where they determined that I was 128/86. At the time I was told to wait and I would be the 4th person in. Well low and behold 3 hrs later I was still not looked at again even though I felt like i was going to pass out. I then ripped the bands off and handed them to the guard and left. I contacted my primary in the morning and was given a antibiotic as a caution for being in the ER and an Allergy medicine to clear me out as I had become stuffy headed. I returned to his office once again and when my pressure was taken it was again 90/60. We discussed briefly Addisons and Conns with the impression that it could be Conns. I was give and Gucosteriod to at .1mg to see if that would assist. Turns out that my face and eyes swelled and then meds had to be stopped. I have in process an full blood workup. But I now have insomnia ( i am currently righting this at 03:20am ) and when I do fall asleep I sleep for approx 10hrs. and feel like I have been run over by a convoy of freight trains. Due to my arthritis I cannot get up quickly so i cannot determine if i get dizzy when i stand though i have had bouts of when the room appears to shake back and forth.  I also have been having the need to eat more then I normally would then anxiety attacks are more frequent and i am seeking more salty food then i normally would. ( Due to my wifes diet for end stage renal failure we avoid extra salt ) When I wake I am in pain, sore and fatgiued. I am now up to 3mg of Xanax and also 5 motrin to help combat the pain. Vicodin and Xcontin have never been of any help and i refuse to use them. I guess what I am asking is are we on the right track with Addisons and Conns... I have extremly Low T and fit 90% of the low T diagnostics... or should we be looking elsewhere , once i have a copy of my blood work I have no problem with giving numbers if asked. An yes i am currently looking for someone on my insurance plan to perform a Gastric Band. I have found to many issues for a bypass .... Thank you to anyone that can provide any usefull information  Thank you T\n\n",

I am reminded of a saying....\"When you hear the hoofs, think 'Horse' and NOT 'Zebra'!. The fact is \"Common things Always occur commonly\". The 'common' reason for craving for salt in your case could have been the fact that you had been on a low salt diet for some time on account of your wife's end stage renal failure.Instead you tended to think of Addison's.The low salt diet could have caused the hypotension that you noted. (kindly note that all these are my first thoughts after reading your account.It is quite possible that i turn out to be entirely wrong and you -entirely right) Having said that, i feel that you took the right decision by going to the hospital for a check up.

    "content": "Dr.M.Aroon kamath, Thank you for the reply, It is greatly appreciated. I have been trying to do a lot of my own research as well as looking into other avenues that could be part of the problem. When i wrote up the post I was not including some details that at the time I did not think where relevant. But also more then likely still wont point to Addisons or Conns. The seeking Salt might be due to the fact that of her Renal Diet though I would hope after 20yrs together I would have gotten over the need for it. Though I do not dismiss the idea. Some of the things that I did not mention was for the most part what I thought of as lifestyle and not attributing to my Health. The first being that for the longest time in Grade School ( meaning before Middle / JR High ) I would fluctuate greatly in weight going from \"husky\" to thin year after year until puberty where I was then stuck in the \"Husky\" set from then on. During JR and High School the cold did not bother me as much as it does now. I also have seen the same patterns in my brother as we where growing up. I know from last Blood work my Testosterone count was well below the established benchmark and then androgel did not provide any change. The same being with the T3 and T4 Uptake for my Thyroid.  To be honest at this point I am waiting for my current blood work and some explanation and or idea to head next. As I have had a severe headache and fatigue for the last 2 weeks or more. As an example I went to bed last night with a blood sugar of 149, and had nothing to eat and went right to sleep awoke ( late ) this morning at 8:30am still feeling  fatigued and the headache worse and when I arrived at work this morning my blood sugar was 135. If by chance you have a different Idea as to what may be wrong please let me know my doctor is open to any and all suggestions as he does not like to just \"throw\" medicine at some one and hope it works.... Thanks again\n\n",

I take 45 of lantus in the morning and 30 at night and on a sliding scale of 4 units for every 50 points above 150. Also I have noticed that I am getting the shakes if i go below 120. I was at 112 the other day and was shaking like crazy. Also I have been having bouts of sleeplessness and bouts of falling asleep at anytime... This has not become a real endangerment to my career as it is happening at work as well. I do have sleep apnea and currently use my BiPap every time I sleep and its current setting is 14  Thanks again, I know this is not easy but I need some king of answer other then my being overweight. I have been overweight since i was a child and never had the issues I am having now.  Thanks again\n\n",

I currently weigh 245lbs.  I have been treated with Armour for the past year, was fairly well regulated but still felt very exhausted, dosage was increased and synthroid was added resulting in emergency room trip for chest pain and shortness of breath, continued use of the synthroid resulted opposite effect desired...my blood pressure dropped to 90 over 50 and I could barely stay awake, and could not \"connect the dots\" mentally.  Doctor immediately discontinued the synthroid and resumed the original dosage of the Armour.  I put on 30 lbs in a month and 1/2.  I am just starting to feel better, but my joints are aching something terrible and I am getting a headache in my right eye almost daily, I have difficulty in bright light, still cannot tolerate temperature changes, hot or cold.  Family history of thyroid on both sides of family both of my Mother's grandmother's...one had Graves the other had Goiter, on my Father's side, his mother was diabetic and his sister has hypothyroid.  I have been treated by my family doctor and I am not confident he knows what he is doing...I feel like an experiment and my quality of life is sad right now.  My mother passed away last year from colon cancer which spread to her liver.  I have been in a law suit with my sister this past year over the estate.  I'm sure the stress of her death, the ensuing battle and the grieving process have not helped matters.  I would like to get your perspective on how best to approach my health issues.  Are there any books that you can suggest for me to read and do you think I should ask my doctor for a referral to an endo specialist?  If so, how do I find one that is reputable, what tests should I have and what questions should I ask? Thank you in advance for your response, I am really anxious to get back to my life and feel \"normal\".\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ellenmagellin,  It is possible that your Armour thyroid hormone dose is not high enough.  You may still be hypothyroid.  The best way to determine if you are getting the correct dose of thyroid hormone is by testing your thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level periodically.  This is the hormone that normally tells the thyroid gland to make more thyroid hormone.  If the body is even a little bit low on thyroid hormone the TSH will rise.  If your TSH is high it is likely you need more thyroid hormone.  Synthroid works well for most people but some people have reactions like you have had to it.  Seeing an endocrinologist can be helpful if you and your doctor are having trouble getting your symptoms and thyroid levels under control.  Generally, your primary doctor can refer you to a good endocrinologist in your area.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm not particularly familiar with variations in absorption based on timing of the day.  However, if it is absorbed better at night it will take a little less thyroid supplement to reach appropriate levels.  Taking it during the day would mean a little more will need to be take to get the same effect in the blood.  The amount the body \"sees\" is actually the same with either method.  In both cases the TSH levels will guide dosing amounts.  The key is to try to be consistent on when you are taking the medicine if there is a variation in absorption.    Best wishes.\n\n",

I was taking 2.75mcg levoxyl for many years before running out and having to stop cold turkey about 3 months ago. Since then I have become very non-functional. I do know that I have sugar issues, and am overweight (and getting progressively worse since stopping meds), have high blood pressure, and also high cholesterol. My arms and hands are always tingling and go numb at night, my lower back has lost feeling to the touch, and I have serious pain and burning in my legs and feet when I walk. My Dr. that I had in Az refused to give me any more meds without more blood testing (which I cannot afford out of pocket), and we have since been moved to Va by my husband's company. To get a new Dr here will cost even more because they all want $$$ up front and I have been told that because of my issues they will need me to get whole workups and labs that there is no way I can do. Labs will not even let me in the door without $$$ up front. What can I do? Is this something that maybe will lessen with time? As it stands right now I can barely get through a day. HELP!

    "content": "My issue seems to defy any convention. So, I am not even sure if Endocrinology is the right area for this, but here goes.  I am a 25-year-old white male. 5'7\", 142 lbs. Most of my life I have been unable improve strength or build any visual improvement in muscle. What tends to happen is that the longer I follow an exercise schedule, the weaker I tend to feel until it becomes too difficult to continue. For example, least year I began using a friend's Bowflex and continued for 7 weeks while never getting to a point where I could increase the weight/resistance beyond my starting point, and eventually I quit using it. Another example, I recently began doing push-ups on alternating days. On the first day, after not having done any for many months, I was able to easily do 15 before it started to tire me out. Continuing to attempt that every-other day for the last 4 weeks, rather than any feeling of progress or improvement, I continue to feel weaker and weaker until now it takes all my effort just to reach a count of 8! Beyond frustrating, this is actually pretty scary! I can only guess about the cause; I've considered things from broken adrenal glands, autoimmune disease, psychogenic asthenia, a stress disorder, or even vitamin deficiency (although I believe my diet is fairly healthy). I can't afford to see a doctor these days (just a poor college student)... so any insight at all would be helpful.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Exercise results in decreased strength.",
    "content": "Hi, You have been trying weight lifting to build-up your muscles.This is a  'plyometric' type of exercise, which uses non-elastic forces such as gravity ('weight training').Obviously, in your case,you have found it disappointing.  It appears that although you have plenty of motivation,you perhaps lack 'stamina' or 'Endurance'.   To build  up this 'Endurance', it has been recommended by many experts in this field, that 'resistance training' is critical in developing strength and stamina at the same time.  According to the American Sports Medicine Institute (ASMI), the definition of the goal of 'resistance training' is-- \"to gradually and progressively overload the musculo-skeletal system so that it gets progressively stronger\".  Some of the different types of strength training are as follows: - 'isotonic', if  is moving against an opposing force.   - 'isometric', if part of the body is holding still against an      opposing force   It is possible that you may need to build up your endurance first by isotonic  exercises, by using low resistances first and then very gradually hike up the resistance (perhaps your friends 'Bowflex' was of very high resistance and you probably ended up doing 'isometric' exercises). Remember,that In 'isotonic' strength training,full range of motion is critical in resistance training because muscle overload occurs only at a specific angle of the joint when the muscle is contracted repeatedly. After a while, you may follow up with your regular weight lifting.  By the way... you are on Finastride(perhaps for alopecia). Trust you are/were not on steroids.Ideally, one should first exclude other causes for the weakness that you are experiencing, by consulting a doctor.Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Alcohol gets diluted in water in the body.Since females have comparitively more fat and less water the blood levels reach a higher level.Also lean muscle mass being less the deleterious effect on the muscle is more apparent in women for the given amount of alcohol.So take alcohol making sure that you drink slower thus making it easy for the liver to detoxify.Also make sure that you take proper nutrition since alcohol,unlike foods go directly in circulation and have not much nutritive value except beers and also can reduce the levels of micronutrients and consequent weakness.Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I recently visited my Dr. to discuss some mild sexual disfunction.  He drew blood to test my hormone levels. Hormone levels were low and prolactin was borderline high. I have a daily opiate habit so I think that the my sexual dysfunction is probably due to the opiate use. However, I'm very worried now becuase my DR. referred me to an endocrinologist and told me to get an MRI of my pituitary. On top of the stress that I carry with my inability to function in bed at times (which is due more to being married to the same woman for 5 years than it is a lack of sexual drive in general), I'm scared to death now that I may have a tumor. Could all this be due to my opiate use? If my Dr. knew that I abused opiates, do you think he would have ordered an MRI? Only reason I haven't told my doc is out of fear for this to be attached to my medical records and I do not know the reprocussions involved with being a registered addict. This is causing me so much stress that I can't even think straight. I'm trying to get my wife pregnant, thinking about taking a new job, etc. Any advice would really be great.\n\n",

    "title": "Is 2ndary hyperparathyroidism caused by low vitamin D?",
    "content": "Hi! I'm a 30 year old female. Recently I had bloodwork for unrelated reasons and it turned out I had slightly elevated calcium (10.5). I did some internet research and learned about hyperparathyroidism and found that for several months I have had many of the symptoms (unusual lethargy, forgetfulness, heart palpitations and occasional racing) which I had never really considered specific or serious enough to go to the doctor for.  I had another blood test and was told that my vitamin D levels are low and that is what is causing the high calcium. I'm mostly finding this all out through phone messages from office people and haven't been able to actually talk to the doctor so I don't know what my PTH level is; I assume it's high.    After doing some online research I found that there seems to be some controversy about whether low vitamin D and poor calcium absorption actually causes secondary hyperparathyroidism or if that's a \"common misconception\". I was instructed to take vitamin D supplements for 3 months and then have more blood tests. However, since I feel kind of poorly and have learned that hyperparathyroidism can cause serious problems, I would prefer not to wait that long if I would get a more informed diagnosis if referred to an endocrinologist. So my question is: is there a general consensus among people who actually specialize in endocrinology about whether vitamin D deficiency can cause secondary hyperparathyroidism (or can cause high blood calcium in any other way)? Thank you for your opinion.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is 2ndary hyperparathyroidism caused by low vitamin D?",
    "content": "Hi, About 25 mmol of calcium enters the body in a normal diet. Of this, about 40% (10 mmol) is absorbed by the gut,and 5 mmol is lost in feces. Apart from the loss of calcium through the bowel, the other principal routes of calcium excretion are via the kidneys and the skin.   Vitamin D is an important co-factor in the intestinal absorption of calcium. It also promotes re-absorption of calcium in the kidneys.Both of these actions are under the influence of parathormone.  The kidney excretes 250 mmol of calcium a day in urine and resorbs 245 mmol, leading to a net loss in the urine of about 5 mmol/l. In addition to this, the kidney processes Vitamin D into calcitriol, the active form that is most effective in enhancing intestinal absorption.  In normal individuals in zero calcium balance, calcium excreted via the skin and urine must equal net calcium absorbed.Calcium levels in the serum in health are very tightly controlled.  Normally lowering of serum calcium will result in.......PTH being secreted in response....serum calcium corrected by release of calcium from bone.....PTH then withdrawn.  Hypovitaminosis D, will affect the conversion of vitamin D to its active form and thus impair absorption....resulting in a .....resulting in a tendency for lowering of serum calcium .......serum calcium corrected by release of calcium from bone.....impaired absorption continues.....net loss of calcium continues....results in osteoporosis. As serum calcium remains fairly normal throughout, parathyroid over-stimulation does not occur to a large extent.  Hypovitaminosis D is well known to be \"Co-Exist\" with(not \"caused by\") primary & secondary hyperparathyroidism.    Whether Hypovitaminosis D can cause secondary hyperparathyroidism by itself,is not conclusively known.Whether the Hypovitaminosis D is the 'cause' or the 'effect' is unclear.  There are on-going studies to elucidate this.Some workers believe that at least some patients with Hypovitaminosis D perhaps develop secondary hyperparathyroidism. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thyroid adjustments can affect your period.  If you go more than three months without a period (amenorrhea) you should report this to your prescribing doctor who may want to evaluate your hormone levels (TSH, estrogen, progesterone, FSH, etc.).  Often this is needed at various times in your cycle so don't expect to get an immediate answer.  If your thyroid is too low, this may be the result and sometimes there is a degree of trial and error to get the right therapeutic dose of thyroid hormone.  Your doctor will want to know how the dose change has effected any of your body's systems, but the alteration in your period may be just temporary so giving it a few months before seeing your doctor is worthwhile.  Missing a period or two is not indicative of a serious concern so don't worry about it too much.  Patience is key in regulating hormones like this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I note two seemingly important features in your profile.One is that you were diagnosed with 'Essential Tremor Syndrome' (ET) in 2001 and that your father has parkinson's disease.  'Essential Tremor Syndrome' is  a progressive neurologic disorder mainly affecting the upper limbs, but may involve other areas as well- Characterized by intension tremors(kinetic tremors).   Some non-motor features have also been seen to occur with ET such as, depressive & anxiety symptoms as well as cognitive difficulties.  A familal pattern has been seen in some of the cases.About 50% of the cases may have a genetic mutation( presumably autosomal dominant transmission).  ET patients have a higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease.  There is no cause that i know of which can produce changes in body temperature on one half of the body. In your case, whether this represents a non-motor feature of ET needs to be looked into. Please consult a neurologist who will be able to sort this out. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I am 32 years male. I have cyst in left lobe of thyroid. I have gone through the isotope scan and it shows cold nodule. The nodule was diagnosed in 2007. My latest reports says:  1.       US          :               left lobe size = 5.5x3.3x4 cm ( isthmus and right lobe   appear normal )  2.       Blood    :               TSH = 1.19  FT4 = 1.20  FT3 = 3.43  FNAC shows benign nodule.  I am going to surgery after two days. I have taken opinion from three endocrinologist. Two endo says that i should have full thyrodictomy, while one says that i should go for half thyrodictomy and after the histopathology result the second surgery might be possible if malignant cell detected in analysis.  After two days i have a half thyrodictomy surgery. My surgeon is confident to save all four parathyroid, vocal cord and recurrent nerve.  I am too much confused about the second surgery that the FNAC result might be wrong. I want to ask some of the questions here that :  1. After half thyrodictmy will I need to take thyroxine for the rest of my life. 2. How much is the possibility that FNAC result are wrong. 3. If I go through the second surgery for removing the entire gland, will the surgeon remove lymph nodes across thyroid ? then what will happen if there is some infection around neck in future because no lymph node will be there to fight infection. 4. What is re-occurrence rate of malignant thyroid? 5. How can i be safe from metastasis to lung and bones ? 6. If histopathalogy found papillary then after surgery and radio active iodine what will be normal span of life. Does papillary shorten the average life span ?  I hope you will give all the answer as I am in very tension.  Thanks  Anjum\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Cyst in left lobe of Thyroid",
    "content": "Hi, It would have been immensely helpful if details of the biopsy report had been provided. Generally, the histopathologist would mention which benign nodule they are referring to- for example, a follicular neoplasm, a colloid nodule,colloid cyst etc. Surgical management of thyroid disorders varies between hospitals and sometimes within an institution.Some advocate total thyroidectomy for most conditions.Others may, in certain cases first perform a hemi-thyroidectomy and proceed to a total thyroidectomy when a frozen section report becomes available.  Now,about trying to answer your questions one by one....  1) After half a lobe of thyroid is removed (and if proves to be benign),one can't accurately predict how much the remaining lobe is capable of producing the hormones. Periodic post-operative thyroid function tests will help to determine if thyroxin supplements would be needed or not.If it turns out to be malignant, the surgeon, in all probability would remove the rest of the thyroid, in which case,life-long thyroxin for TSH supression will be needed.  2) Depends on the experience of the pathologist.  3) Unnamed alternative lymphatic channels are thought to develop.  4)Depends on histological type of the tumor, successful local & regional lymph nodal clearance and other factors.  5) This will depend upon the type of tumor, whether histopathology showed any vascular invasion,grade of the tumor etc.  6) Cancer-specific mortality in relation to papillary thyroid carcinoma is multi-factorial and still being studied.

    "title": "Re: Underactive Thyroid/Adrenal Fatigue",
    "content": "Hi, It is very true that hypothyroidism and addison's disease may co-exist.  As you may be aware, some forms of hypothyroidism are due to auto-immune forms of thyroiditis, which can be associated with other auto-immune diseases such as Addison's disease,type 1 diabetes mellitus,auto-immune oophoritis (very rare) etc.  It is also well known that in some cases of hypothyroidism, thyroxin therapy 'unmasks' underlying Addison's disease.   Many known diseases have disease associations.It is at times, impractical or cost-effective to test for each one of these associated diseases.  Hypothyroidism is a common disease with a lifelong risk in women (approaching 10%). but, Addison's disease is rare. Tests for hypothyroidism are inexpensive and easily accessible, whereas biochemical diagnosis of Addison's disease usually requires more sophisticated and relatively expensive tests, more appropriate in a secondary care setting.  Whether one should routinely test every patient with Hypothyroidism for Addison's is debatable.Many workers at present believe that if a hypothyroid patient deteriorates on initiation of thyroxin therapy, he/she should be investigated for Addison's. Also,it has been suggested that one should look carefully for stigmata of Addison's disease such as postural hypotension, weight loss, skin and mucosal pigmentation,and hyperkalaemia. If present,one must go ahead and test for Addison's disease.  There are others who may opt for routine testing in every case of hypothyroidism. This is an on-going debate. Best wishes!\n\n",

This caused horrendous bleeding, I bled from March until November, daily, non-stop.  Then the dr's insisted I should go on Nuva Ring, I did & went off of that in February when my husband deployed & was off of it for about 7 months.  When he returned I went back on the ring for about 3 months & I hated it.  Husband had a Vasectomy in March of 2007, I have been birth control free since January of 2007.  One of my main problems are inability to lose weight, despite a good diet (well a good one before) & exercise.  I exercised 5x's a day & ate right for 5 months straight & didn't lose a single pound.  It was horrible.  I was so tired, I had to drag myself to the gym & after spending an hour there I would come home & nap for at least 3 hours during the day, on top of getting at least 12 hours of sleep each night.

Thyroid December 08 -  TSH 0.295 (Preference Interval .450-4.5) T4, Free (Direct) 1.09 (Preference Interval .61-1.76)  Thyroid January 09- Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies <10 (Preference Interval <35) T-4 Free .9 (Preference Interval .8-1.8) TSH 3rd Generation .63 (Preference Interval .4-4.5)  Thyroid May 09- T4 Free Direct .99 (Preference Interval .61-1.76) TSH .663 (Preference Interval .45-4.5) Triiodothyronine, Free, Serum 2.9 (Preference Interval 2.3-4.2) Thyroid Peroxidase <10 (Preference Interval 0-34)  Saliva Testing June 09- Estradiol (Saliva) 2.8 (Reference Range 1.3-3.3) Progesterone 25L (Reference Range 75-270) Ratio: Pg/E2 9L (Reference Range Optimal 100-500 when E2 1.3-3.3 pg/ml) Testosterone 14L (Reference Range 16-55, Age Dependent) DHEAS 13.2 (Reference Range 2-23, Age Dependent) All of the above were in units of pg/ml accept Ratio  Pg/E2. The following are in units of ng/ml Cortisol Morning 3.6L (Reference Range 3.7-9.5) Cortisol Noon 1.0L (Reference Range 1.2-3.0) Cortisol Evening 1.4 (Reference Range .6-1.9) Coritsol Night .5 (Reference Range .4-1.0)  I had to fill out a none, mild, moderate, severe symptom list for with the hormone testing.  I will include my moderate to severe symptoms.  Vaginal Dryness, Incontinence, Foggy Thinking, Tearful, Sleep Disturbed, Headaches, Aches & Pains, Morning Fatigues, Evening Fatigue, Cold Body Temperature, Sugar Craving, Weight Gain -Waist & Hips mostly, Decreased Libido, Loss of Scalp Hair, Mood Swings, Tender Breasts, Bleeding Changes, Irritable, Anxious, Decreased Stamina, Dry & Brittle Hair, Constipation, Increased Urinary Urge (often feel like I have a mild UTI), Low Blood sugar  The results I have with the hormone testing is that I am pre-menopausal, estrogen dominance during the luteal phase & that may interfere with thyroid function (dr's refuse to believe anything is wrong with my thyroid), testosterone level is too low for my age, adrenal fatigue - adrenals are pretty much shut down.  I have been on Prometrium to up my progesterone levels since the beginning of August.  I am taking 25mgs days 14-28.  Haven't seen much of a difference, it made my period very long the last time I had it & I am sleeping better at night on it.  Dr just added Zoloft (25mg daily) to my meds last Thursday.  He thinks I am clinically depressed, but I guess anyone going through what I am going through would be depressed too.  I don't feel like I am depressed, I feel like I just want these problems solved & can't figure out how to do it.    On a normal day I need to nap after I get my son from school for about an hour & then I am recharged until bed at 9/9:30 at night.  Now with being on the zoloft I am completely tired all day & have no motivation or desire to get off the couch.  I go back to the dr in 9 days to see how the Zoloft is working.  it isn't working, it is making me feel worse.    I normally see a D.O. I think it is time I ask to see a specialist to fix these problems.  What kind of specialist do I need to see & what kind of information do I need to go into the appointment with?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hormone Imbalance, Adrenal Fatigue",
    "content": "Hello, I would recommend seeing an endocrinologist if in spite of a good trial of treatment you don't feel improvement but first I would discuss the concerns with your current doctor who may have good reasons for the current course of action.  Before seeking a specialist, I would want to be sure I understood where this doctor is coming from.  If your situation is sub-clinical and labs don't make it clear, an endocrinologist may not be willing to find other answers and may rely on the lab tests for confirmation.  If you do seek another opinion, the most helpful information to take would be your lab results and a journal that outlines your symptoms.  Include when you take your medication and the effects you notice.  thyroid-info.com can help you determine this.  Neurotransmitters can affect many body systems and people benefit from the SSRI antidepressants such as Zoloft beyond major depression.  They are often used for other conditions as well.  But, dosing regulation can be tricky.  It takes a while for the drugs to show their effects as your body adjusts and often after a couple of weeks or so a dosage adjustment is needed or try taking it at the opposite time of day.   Sometimes a different form of SSRI or similar medication is needed.  It's a trial and error thing.  If you find after a few weeks that you still feel worse on the Zoloft, perhaps a different medication will work better for you.  It takes a lot of patience to get the regulation that works for you.    There is a condition called subclinical hypothyroidism - a kind of borderline condition and there is controversy about treating it.  It may progress to overt hypothyroidism.  When labwork does not reveal clear answers, there is always debate about treatment and how effective it might be and whether or not the potential benefits would outweigh the side effects that might result from treating it with medication.  Often the best thing to do is continue to monitor for changes in the levels.    The body's endocrine system with its many hormones is very complex and it can take a long time to figure out the problem as well as the solution.  The progesterone should help balance out the estrogen and help with the adrenal dysfunction so that is a good treatment.  Often oral contraceptives are tried because they tend to deliver a more predictable and stable rate of hormones.  It is usually seen as a fairly easy treatment to try with few risks if you are not a smoker or have no history of blood clots.  But, they certainly are not a cure-all so if you don't want to take them, I would not see a problem with refusal.    A few other lifestyle changes that might help with adrenal insufficiency include: \u2022 Stress reduction. Chronic stress repeatedly forces the adrenal glands to sustain high levels of cortisol. Take more time for yourself and exercise daily.    \u2022 Sleep 7-9 hours a night. The hormone seems to be helping this now so that's good. Lack of sleep can be caused by stress, hormonal imbalance, by physical, emotional and psychological factors.  \u2022 Eat a diet rich in healthy whole foods, fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes and fiber.  \u2022 Take a daily multivitamin.  \u2022 Add essential fatty acids from fish oil to your diet.  \u2022 Since sugar stimulates the adrenals, reduce or eliminate sugar and alcohol from your diet.  Other conditions such as diabetes and hypoglycemia can also cause generalized symptoms so you may want to ask the doctor about those.      Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  The ultrasonic appearance of a thyroid nodule does not reliably differentiate a benign thyroid lesion and cancer.  However, there are some ultrasonographic signs that are thought to indicate increased risk of cancer--  1.Central intra-nodular vascularity  2. Incomplete/absent halo  3. Hypoechoic nodules  4. Irregular margins  5. Microcalcifications  6. Documented enlargement of a nodule  7. predominantly solid composition  One must remember that these are only certain guidelines (not universally accepted)  Certainly the next step most would recommend in your case would be a FNAC(Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology) of the mass(whatever the result of Thyroid function tests). best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "i am a 26 year old who was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism.  I went to my doctor complaining of heart palpatations, shortness of breath and missing periods.  Blood tests revealed hyperthyroidism.  I was put on blood pressure meds to relieve the palpatations and sent to endocrinologist.  Only 3 months later, my thyroid tests were normal.  My doc said that the hyperthyroidism was caused by a weakened immune system ( i had a cold) and that my periods would return shortly.  ( i have never heard of this, nor am i able to get any info online).  Now, six months later, my thyroid tests still show normal, palpatations are gone, im off of blood pressure meds, but i still have no period.  Endocrineologist did more labwork, and said all my hormones are fine, testosterone is slightly elevated at 57 but not out of normal range.  So they are sending me to my GYN to 'stimulate' my period.  My question is; is this normal?  Like i said i never heard of a cold causing thyroid problems, and i am frustrated that my doctor cannot give me any solutions, and is now sending me to the gyn.  i don't know that i trust them.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, There is a type of thyroiditis known as Subacute thyroiditis (also some call it 'De Quervain's thyroiditis') which is thought to  be due to a viral cause. Most patients give a history of a upper respiratory infection 2-8 weeks prior to the onset of thyroiditis. Therefore, many cases tend to occur during summer months.   A few cases have been reported due to the mumps virus. High titers of mumps antibodies may be found in some patients.   Association with other viral conditions(infectious mononucleosis,measles, influenza, adenovirus, coxsackievirus etc)is also known.  Severity of the disease is highly variable.Sometimes it is so mild that it passes off like an attack of 'flu'.  Clinical course is usually 'triphasic' - hyperthyroidism, followed by a hypothyroid phase and finally normothyroidism.  I hope this information is useful to you.Good day!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a female 38yrs old. I have been suffering from severe vomiting, severe abdominal pain, occasional diarrhea. I have been hospitalized 6 times in the last 3 months. The last one I went to Methodist in Houston, as I am wanting answers to these symptoms and others I have been having. My last stay indicated a Cortisol reading of only 1 with blood test.  The Doctors came and explained to me that a normal reading should be anywhere from a 10-25. And that they wanted to inject me with something and then draw blood at different intervals.  We did this. The first reading level went up to 23. The second reading level went to 30. The final {next morning blood drawing} revealed reading back down to a 2.  The Doctor on my case referred me to an Endocrinologist from Baylor College.   Let me back up a bit. I initially went to the E.R with severe, and I do mean screaming severe abdominal pain, watery stool movement, and dehydration. Vomiting also present. When they began doing test, blood test and all sorts of CT,MRI, X-Ray, Endoscopy, Colonoscopy, they found the Low Cortisol levels.  The Endo Doc wanted to do a ACTH test. And MRI. I was released from hosp after 5 days and told to call the Endo Doc back regarding results from the ACTH test.  Well I did this only to be told that they were fine, and my low cortisol level were due to stress due to being sick from Gastro-bug and Gastrinitis.  I didnt get to give a full medical history, and after I came home and researched low cortisol did I then realize I have been suffereing from other symptoms as well.  I am fatigued I have lost 20lbs in last 6weeks {not intentional} If I get up too fast I get dizzy, nearly blacking out. Have to sit back down immediately. This weakness\\painful calf/ leg pain {this started within last 3 mths} Mild depression Sleeping excessively {most recently} And inability to sleep at times Diminished ability to fight infection { constantly going to the doctor for upper resp. infections, yeast infections, U.T.I's, bladder infections, and M.A.R.S} Less alert in the afternoon-just too tired and a sugar drop feeling Confusion Can not stand the cool temps of my own home when all else is only comfortable No sex drive No skin pyg  The vomiting, abdominal pain, dearrhea and leg pain plus back pain {which I thought to be kidney infection related} has only been recently....started in July-2009. I was referred to a upper G.I doctor my 1st or 2nd hospital stay. He did a endoscopy test and said my stomach was inflammed, and that I had a Gastro-bug then the next hospital stay said it was Gastrinitis, or something very close to that.   He doesnt know about the Cortisol levels yet, and I'm not usre that it would make much difference to him as he feels he has his diagnosis.  I feel the Gastro is secondary to whats going on.  Its extremely late and I know I am missing some info here that could or would be more helpful. I guess I will just wait until I have {hopeful}  responses.  Thanks tjsb21\n\n",

    "content": "You have many symptoms of low cortisol as well as hypothyroidism due to lack of cortisol to shuttle the thyroid hormone properly into your cells.  I would ask your endo to do a 24 hour urine test for cortisol.   Blood tests and multi-point saliva tests (better) and even the ACTH stimulation test (what you got), can miss sometimes.   But the urine test is hard to trick.  See how your total cortisol production for the day is.  I wager its way too low.  Id be sure to remove proper cortisol levels as a variable before moving on to the next thing to test, which would be thyroid function if it were me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi tjsb21, Having gone through your post and the following post by endomess,let me add a few comments.  Most common cause of cortisol deficiency these days is perhaps, diets very rich in carbohydrates.Add to this mental and emotional stress and you have the perfect recipe for cortisol deficiency.  Hypothyroidism affects function of the adrenal gland cells just as lack of thyroid hormone affects cells in the rest of the body.As the adrenal glands are unable to function normally,cortisol levels drop.So, it is the thyroid function affecting adrenal function rather than vice-versa.Most of the thyroid hormone produced by the thyroid gland (93%) is T4 and only (7%) is T3(the more active form).  The conversion of T4 to T3 occurs MAINLY IN THE LIVER.  Some people are unable to convert T4 to T3 efficiently - why? ...perhaps a combination of genetics, sub-optimal nutrition and liver toxicity.  There is paucity of evidence that cortisol has any major role to play in this conversion or to shuttle thyroxin into the cells. What is known however, is that INCREASED cortisol production due to stress does BLOCK the conversion of T4 to T3 by the liver.  Thus available evidence does not support the view that low levels of cortisol have any significant role to play in T4-T3 conversion than high levels of cortisol.  As far as your clinical picture is concerned, it is probable that some kind of liver toxicity (exact cause needs elucidation) could have caused the low cortisol levels.Pre-existing hypothyroidism has to be ruled out as well. Best wishes!\n\n",

If you are healthy, not losing weight with good appetite and no other concerning symptoms related to the above mentionned diseases such as chronic cough that is non-resolving, coughing up blood, having a new tumour, i would suggest that you try to cover up at night with a sheet especially if you have a heater on.

I've been waking up drenched in a cold sweat but my house is either normal temp.Or cold.I wake up feeling weak but as soon as I get up&get moving&dry I feel totally fine.now as far as any past health problems that maybe related to these new night sweats are: recently, I just had my first yeast infection I guess I had it for a while&didnt know because it wasn't burning or itchy. I thought it was gone but I still have a thick slightly colored discharge coming from me today.I'm thinking it maybe a bacterial infection now because I let the yeast stay as long as I did.(I'm going to doc. For that to know for sure) Also, I've had an eating problem for the past 2yrs now that I feel originally steamed from depression I was gong through at the time.I used to feel nauses to eat but its gotten better.&don't get me wrong its not a wieght issue I want to gain wieght. I don't vomit yellow acids in the mornings anymore however, to this day I still have little to no appitite.&it sucks because I used to love food!its so hard for me to gain weight even when I am eating the full 3meals a day.I can't seem to get past 100.I got to 110 once but that was short lived.However,but to lose wieght is very easy!&the last thing that maybe related to these recent night sweats is I have random occasions for the past2yrs that I have trouble breathing in my sleep&its scary but they have always been random nights never consistant.I read one thing that maybe causing these night sweats maybe something called hodgkins desiese? My lympnodes on my neck I can feel&they move around but I'm not sure if I'd call the little balls themselves tender?I'm scared because I have all the symptoms that were listed now exept fevers& I'm not sure if my lympnodes are swollen.is it normal to be able to easily feel them? But maybe its just stress because I do have a lot of it in my life now.please help me with any advice I have no insurance but I'm really concerned.I'm a dancer&model my good health means everything to me!\n\n",

    "title": "Constant Hunger / Weight Gain - Which tests needed?",
    "content": "I am a 39 year old male that feels something is wrong my doctor isn't picking up on.  I started at just above ideal weight, but now I have been gaining weight steadily for the last 3 years (about 12 pounds a year).  All of the gained weight is around my stomach, neck, and face - my arms and legs haven't changed and still have muscle definition.  Now I am in the low end of obese category.  I am almost incessantly hungry, only the biggest meals keep me saitiated and then only an hour or two.  I try to eat all whole grains, lean meats, fish (3x/week), and a good mix of fruits and vegetables.  I am eating 3 large meals and 2-3 \"snacks\" a day to keep my hunger under control.  I am still very active and have aerobic exercise 3-4 times a week (30 minutes/time) and additional hiking and skiing on the weekends.  I am actually kind of a fidgety, hyper person.  My job is constant walking and being on my feet (warehouse).  I haven't changed my job, diet, or  overall routine in the past 10 years, but now I have this weight gain and hunger. I realize mentally I am eating too often and too much, but I still feel like I am eating the minimum to keep from feeling like starvation.  If I try to cut back on portion size I am hungry an hour later.  If I don't eat at that point my hunger is very deep and primal, not in my stomach.  I become weak, tired, shaky, and mentally slow -- basically unable to work (like my glucose is crashing, but my morning fasting glucose tests normal).  Eating temporarily solves the problem.  I keep telling my doctor these symptoms at my yearly check-up's but the answer I get is \"eat less and exercise more.\"  I'd love to eat less, if I didn't feel so bad.  I was given an OGTT (3 hour) and HbA1c test.  Both normal, so I am not diabetic. My blood cytology, blood chemistry, and  cholesterol/lipid panel were all normal and pretty good for my rising weight, except a high sedimentation rate.  My blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not high enough to require treatment.  What tests should I have my doctor run to check for the cause???  I want to lose weight, but feel something is really wrong, because I was skinny most of my life.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 53, 6'2\", 185lb, white male who only takes medication for Hypothyroidism. I started taking Synthroid ~6yrs ago, at 25mcg (for ~2years), then Levothyroxine at 25mcg (for ~4 years.) On Friday, 8/7/09, I spent the night in a hospital (for 1st time since birth) for abnormal gas/pressure buildup in the upper abdomen which caused chest pain, etc. Emergency room doc took chest x-rays,EKG,blood tests, but found nothing other than an elevated TSH (22.4)level. An internist reviewed the tests and concluded no abnormalities. Heart doctor performed a (15 min+) stress test and said heart was perfect. I was released by 1pm next day (Saturday) and told to follow up with my General MD on Monday. He reviewed hospital info and decided to put me on Levoxyl at 50 mcg. For the next 15 days I took my Levothyroxine at 50mcg to use up that Rx, then switched to the Levoxyl. But, Levoxyl gave me a pelvic rash within 3 days,so I was switched back to Levothyroxine at 50mcg. Recent blood test show TSH levels normal again. I've had a lot of continual pain in the back of lower skull since; and the pain seems to increase with time. Also experiencing  sporadic dizziness as well as blurred vision, and some shoulder joint pain since. Why???  Also, I have been taking 1 Tylenol PM generally each night to sleep. What gives?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, The symptoms you were initially  experiencing could have been on account of hypothyroidism or side-effects of levothyroxin therapy(more likely to be the former).  Now that the Euthyroid status has been achieved, your more recent symptoms (head ache and dizziness) could be due to lack of sleep(tension head ache?).  Although you have been taking Tylenol perhaps, for a significant length of time, your sleep may be inadequate.So, you have to consult your regular doctor to exclude this possibility.Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 28yr old male who was having TMD pains for going on 8yrs.  At 25 I decided to go to a cranial chiropractor due to the many stories of it being successful for TMD.  I realize now that this wasn't a specialized cranial chiropractor.  The chiropractor informed me that I had a small curve in my back, some deterioration in my C1, C2 and T4 spine and maybe a crack in spine.  I had several mri's before this of my spine and all came back neg, she informed me that if the neck is out of alignment it can play a big role on TMD.  I began to see her 2 times a week for 5mos. getting many spinal manipulations of my cervical, thoracic, lumbar and even risks.  I was desperate and didn't believe anything could go wrong, but it did.  The more I went the worse my back and neck felt to a point I had to get a back brace when driving and a special pillow for my neck.  I had her take follow-up x-rays and she said \"uh-oh\".  She then offered to fix the issues I was having free of charge.  I refused and stop seeing her.  After a couple of weeks I felt a drastic drop in my energy with continuing back and neck pain.  Eventually I started having many sympathetic type symptoms, my hands and skin became very dry, I started to lose my hair in spots, my metabolism slowed down, I had trouble sleeping and would wake up just after 4hrs of sleep and be up for the day and hard for me to concentrate and focus.  I had a weak bladder and sex-drive.  also my joints, back, and neck began to constantly pop with pain which they never did before and my cartilage began to break down in my knees where it was painful just to walk up a hill. The back and neck pain seemed to trigger all of this so i had mri's which came back as me having 3 bulging discs in my cervical and scoliosis, but no pinch nerves.  I then had some blood work with my neurologist and it came back neg.  He's referring me to a Rheumatologist now, but I think it might be more of a Endocrine problem.  I would like to know if possible how this can happen...it all triggers with the pain in my mid back where I feel an instant lost of energy and also my neck pain which is better when I sleep where I have no pain in my neck for the night.  Some of my symptoms have gotten slowly better where I'm sleeping somewhat better, I have better bladder control and some of my hair is growing back, but most of my symptoms still persist.  I would greatly appreciate any advice or information you can give me.  Thank You,  Ryan\n\n",

I was told at the time by my GP that it was perfectly normal and due to puberty. They have stayed the same my whole life and have never given me any trouble. I have been to a urologist recently and I am currently undergoing tests, for what he thinks is an intestinal yeast infection. During his examination, he noticed they were swollen and asked if I had been tested to see what it was and I said no- but I told him what my GP said when I was 14. He left it at that! What could be the cause of the enlarged glands and should I be concerned? Thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Inguinal lymph nodes are quite commonly enlarged & palpable in a sizable number of people in a given population - esp in geographic areas where people walk bare-footed.  The inguinal nodes drain a wide area including the perineum, lower most parts of the vagina(in females), the anal canal and lower limbs.Thus they probably encounter higher bacterial/antigenic loads than lymph nodes elsewhere.So, it is not surprising that they are commonly palpable.Infections(candidial) in one area that is frequently overlooked is in between the toes (web spaces).  Yeasts (candida albicans) is a resident of the intestines in almost all normal people. But, they become pathogenic in malnourished individuals or immuno-compromised individuals.  Anyone who has candidial infection of intestine or invasive candidiasis must ideally have their immunocompetency ascertained.  Best wishes!\n\n",

After I had my baby, the numbers went back up a little, but ended back up in the normal range.  My TSH levels are now usually around 0.63 and my Free T4 came out to be 0.67 (for both, it says the range is 0.4 - 4.5). I have an enlarged thryoid gland (goiter) and have typical symptoms of hypothyroidism, yet my doctor says everything is fine.  I don't feel fine.  I'm concerned that even though the TSH and FT4 levels are considered \"normal\", aren't they a wee bit low?  For them both to be lower like that, it makes me wonder if I have a pituitary gland issue?  I'm planning to see a new endocrinologist eventually to get another opinion, but wanted to throw it out here to get your thoughts.  Thanks in advance for any input!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I sincerely hope you are using this medication (lamotrigine) under medical supervision.  This drug, a 'sodium channel blocker' is approved by FDA only for a handful of indications(such as partial seizures,seizures in 'Lennox-Gastaut syndrome', a very severe form of epilepsy & in Bipolar I disorder).  All fainting episodes may not be the \"drop attacks\" associated with 'Lennox-Gastaut syndrome'.  In this condition (as far as my knowledge goes), the person falls NOT due to 'black outs', but due to the spasms and disturbances in balance.  There are reports in the literature of studies on the use of this drug in cocaine abuse.  Also there are reports of abuse of this drug, perhaps due to the mistaken belief that this works better in epilepsy in general.  It is believed that women are more prone to side effects of this drug.  I must caution the public that this drug has very severe side effects and should not be used without strict medical supervision.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Thyroid being attacked by antibodies",
    "content": "I had a mild sore throat the weekend of 9/12/09. The sore throat lasted until the following Monday and I had started feeling very flu-like. I had sensations of pressure or fullness in my head, my head felt very heavy. I was quite fatigued also. I had a loss of appetite, so I was getting subsequent stomach aches. I wasn't sleeping very well. I also experienced dizziness and disequilibrium which is more then likely connected to complications with Vestibular Neuritis (I suffered from this for about a year back in 2007, never fully recovered and have delt with very mild, manageable dizziness ever since). Gradually, going into the following weeks, the insomnia and loss of appetite improved. However, the flu-feeling comes and goes in waves and I feel very uncomfortable most of the time. A bit anxious when symptoms are worse. My head continues to feel heavy alot of the time, feel very uncomfortable upon waking every day, I have this weak-feeling in my legs and feel flu-like. I noticed this improves throughout the day most days but comes and goes.  I have gotten bloodwork done. The tests revealed that anti-bodies are attacking my thyroid which means I will have problems with it in the future according to my doctor. The tests also indicated that there was streptolycin in my blood stream which my doc. told me means I either have strep or had it. For this, he put me on Augmentin just incase it's a strep virus that's causing my symptoms (I find this odd since my sore throat was very mild and only lasted a few days, and I haven't had a sore throat since). I had Evoked potential-testing perfomed aswell as one other test and MRI a couple years back when I was suffering from Vestibular Neuritis and everything came back normal.   One thing I had wondered about was if this could be an adverse reaction to a protein supplement I had been taking before the onset of symptoms. The reason I ask is because before I had gotten sick with my ear 2 years ago, I had been on a strict workout routine and was on a high protein diet which included two protein shakes a day. Before the onset of my current symptoms I was working out but not nearly as hard as I was two years ago prior to my Vestibular Neuritis, and I had been on a high protein diet supplemented by the protein shakes again. I have completely stopped excersizing and taking the shakes since this all started. I have never touched a steroid, illicit drugs, barely drink at all and take vitamins/take care of myself quite well so I'm understandably quite perplexed why this is going on. I haven' felt normal in over a month and am very frustrated. I switched doctors and he wants to see me in about a month (November 20th) to re-check my thyroid levels and see how I'm doing. I want some answers, I've gotten a few different ideas of what could be going on with me but I want to know what this is so I can treat it and get back to normal, please help. Thank you for reading.  ~ Mike\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Thyroid being attacked by antibodies",
    "content": "Hi musician340, It would have been very helpful if you had given the results of the thyroid function tests as well as details about the thyroid antibodies.  I am not aware of proteins or protein supplements causing thyroiditis.But if you strongly suspect that there is a connection,you should request your doctor to report it as an adverse drug reaction.It is always a good policy to report suspected adverse drug reactions.  You say \"march of 2007 I had a bout with Vestibular Neuritis. It took me roughly a year to recover\".  Were you treated for hypothyroidism at that time?  I wonder if you are suspecting that somehow your illness was connected to \"Sporadic adult-onset ataxia\" ?? - of which there are several types - early onset, adult onset, sporadic and heriditary (autosomal dominant and recessive).One of the types of this disorder occurs in hypothyroid individuals.  If that were the case it is perhaps unlikely that you would have improved without correction of hypothyroid status.The fact that you have not mentioned about this leads me to believe that you were not hypothyroid at that time.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "My husband is a marathon runner.  He is 31 years old with no medical conditions and is on no medication.  About six months ago he began to notice that while running his heart rate had significantly increased and he was becoming fatigued very quickly (he wears a monitor).  He kept running, but slowed it down and decreased the frequency.  He then took the entire month of Sept off from any activity (no running, weights or yoga) hoping to recover.  He has lost weight, is irritable, depressed and says his legs are extremely fatigued while running and his heart rate still races, but only when running.  Riding the bike feels fine.  He has been tested for Valley Fever (we live in AZ).  Negative.  He has seen a cardiologist who did an EKG, Echo and a Stress Test.  All came back good.  He has had a chest xray which showed nothing.  From what we've read, he has the symptoms of overtraining, however doctors can not find anything wrong and taking time off has not made him feel any better.  Does this sound like overtraining?  Are there any tests that can diagnose this?  His next step is to see an Endocrinologist, but I want him asking the right questions.\n\n",

    "content": "Here are the answers: - was his \"resting\" heart rate normal? - Resting HR was elevated, but seems to have stabilized.  However, exercise HR is elevated above previous levels at similar stress levels (running pace) - Were his blood counts normal (especially lymphocytes) - CBC was all normal.  Tests were performed in Feb and July.  Lymphocyte levels were 1.8 and 1.9 respectively.  Differential was performed with the Feb. CBC and all tests were in the normal range. - any problems with erections? - No - undue fatigue? - Yes, fatigue and muscle soreness are both symptoms.  Along with HR, fatigue and muscle soreness perception are elevated for similar stress levels. - muscle cramps? - No cramps, but soreness and delayed onset muscle soreness. - any suspicion of depression? - Maybe, but more related to frustration due to lack of diagnosis and lack of progress in resolution of symptoms. - any recent injuries? - No classic injuries (i.e. sprains and strains)  Other symptoms: Disturbed sleep - easily awakened and waking in the middle of the night.  1-2 bathroom trips per night.  Also waking in the morning and not feeling rested.  Chest Xray did show a small (8mm) nodule in the right lung base, only visible in PA view, not visible in lateral view.  Follow up chest xray (5 weeks) showed same nodule with no change in size, shape, or presentation.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's in June of 2007.  I was an extremely healthy, athletic, 22-year-old female.  I immediately started at 25mcg of Synthroid and have since struggled to stay within the normal TSH range of 0.3-3.0.  I understand that my thyroid is slowly \"dying off\" and should soon be finished working.  However, after two years of this I'm still nowhere near the normal range and cannot seem to get close.  I now have a TSH of 5.8 and just upped my Synthroid to 200mcg.  The best I ever felt was when my TSH was as close to 1.0 as possible.    It has been so long since I've felt good.  I'm constantly exhausted, have extremely thin hair and dry skin, and have steadily gained 25 pounds while exercising constantly and eating a very healthy diet.  I am 5'5\" and was 120 pounds for years until I developed Hashimoto's.  I now am around 145 pounds and the weight gain does not seem to stop even though I probably eat around 1500 calories a day.  I am now 24 and am so frustrated.  I'm afraid my weight gain is making me depressed.  When will this stop?  When will my thyroid levels level off for good?    Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: When Will I Be Able to STOP Increasing Synthryoid?",
    "content": "Hi outofwhack, It is somewhat odd that your serum TSH level remains high despite seemingly adequate therapy.What may be the reasons? It may not be out of place to mention the terms 'pharmacokinetics' and 'pharmacodynamics' - which primarily determine how and how good a drug's efficacy is going to be.  Often, when we purchase an electrical/electronic implement, we fail to read the manufaturer's instructions(resulting in break-downs).  Here are some of the recommendations and facts from manufacturers of Thyroxin:    - Keep your tablets in the bottle until it is time to take them (It is therefore very important that thyroxine tablets should be kept in their original container and stored out of sunlight in a cool dry place).  - If you take the tablets out of the bottle they may not keep well.  - Keep in a cool dry place away from light where the temperature stays below 25\u00b0C.   (Thyroxine is stable in dry air, but unstable in the presence of light, heat and humidity. In some cases , thyroxine tablets have been unstable even at room temperature, and storage temperatures of 8\u00b0C to 15\u00b0C were required to maintain potency).  - Administration should preferably be on an empty stomach   - Following oral administration, the absorption of levothyroxine is incomplete and variable (50 to 75%), especially when taken with food (Patients should ideally take thyroxine 30\u201360 minutes before breakfast in order to maximise absorption. If this is too difficult or threatens compliance, the patient may try taking the tablet last thing at night on an empty stomach. Patients who still decide to take their tablets with, rather than before, breakfast need to do this consistently -otherwise fluctuating thyroxine concentrations may result. Depending upon the fibre and milk content of the meal, taking thyroxine with a meal may require a larger dose to maintain euthyroidism, because of the decreased bioavailability)..  Absorbtion may be adversely affected by:       - large amounts of soy products or a high-fiber diet.      - Iron supplements including multivitamins that contain iron      - Cholestyramine , a medication used to lower blood cholesterol levels      - Aluminum hydroxide, which is found in some antacids      - Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate), used in prevention of high blood potassium levels      - Sucralfate, a peptic ulcer medication      - Calcium supplements  - Phenobarbital induces hepatic enzymes and increases the rate of degradation of thyroid hormones. The dosage of levothyroxine may need to be increased when concurrent therapy with phenobarbital is employed.  - Due to potential differences in potency and bioavailability, different levothyroxine products may not be interchangeable. Patients stabilized on a particular brand of levothyroxine should not be unnecessarily switched to another brand. When such a brand change is necessary, the patients must be carefully re-evaluated to assess the potential need for dosage adjustment.  - Estrogens increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin levels, thereby decreasing the unbound fractions of T3 and T4. Administration of estrogen-containing preparations (such as oral contraceptives) to hypothyroid patients may cause an increase in their levothyroxine requirements.  As far as the effects of cortisol on T4-T3 conversion is concerned (post by endomess), the evidence so far is weak and you can perhaps get more info about this in \"Journals of Alternative Medicine\"(for example: Alternative medicine review).  Kindly go through these instructions critically, introspect, and see if in any way some of these facts have any bearing in your unusual case. Good luck!\n\n",

When I was about 14 (the date is very vague, as are many events in my life), I suffered a pretty severe bought of carbon monoxide poisoning. It came up from the basement as my brother, sister and I were sleeping. Luckily we got out safely though it was incredibly difficult - sensorimotor function was greatly impaired, couldn't see well, passed out a few times, etc. as does happen with this type of poisoning. I don't know the level they detected in the house but I remember them saying if we had stayed for another hour we'd all have died. My brother had to drag me out of the house as I couldn't walk and kept fainting. I was hospitalized for 3 days. I mention this because it may or may not be related to my current problems.  When I was about 15 or 16, somewhere around there, I stopped having my periods. I went to a  gynecologist who said I probably had PCOS but didn't really tell me much about it, only gave me a concerned look like \"Are you going to be okay with this news?\" I was like ummm sure whatever, you told me to get on birth control and everything will be dandy right? I didn't really understand. Also she didn't do any tests. A few years later I went to see another doctor (the previous had moved her practice), a nurse practitioner actually, and she had scheduled for me to do loads of bloodwork and even an MRI to look at my pituitary gland? I think. But unfortunately I moved away. I really regret that now!   I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen after that first visit (in high school) for I don't even know how long, a year steadily at least. My periods were fine but the pills made me very nauseated so I really wanted off of them. I also remember this time my hair was falling out like crazy, but I couldn't remember how it was before, so I thought it was normal for me. It is about the same now and my hair has definitely thinned since I was 15. I was pretty active but not incredibly so, my weight and everything seemed fine around this time, I have always been a nice weight, not a twig but always a size small (I'm 5'0!) I remember being exhausted ALL the time. Teachers wrote on my report card \"Appears to need more sleep\" pretty much every quarter. If I sat down for more than 10 minutes I would just become so tired I couldn't keep my eyes open. Although I honestly didn't eat very much - a rough home life led me to eat school lunches and then whatever I could find in the cupboard for dinner most nights. I can still fall asleep at literally any time (with anything going on around me, even loud parties, happens all the time) even though I eat normally. I always remember being like that. I have always craved about 9 or 10 hours of sleep a night as well. I get 8 consistently and still want a nap during the day and my legs often have that tired feeling in them where sitting down feels like heaven. I have also always been very cold, shivering when it's 72 in the shade, but then at the same time in the summer not tolerating the heat like everyone else, feeling my face boiling and my heart rate going crazy when I was hot. I remember once showing my mom my thighs and asking what was wrong with them because they were all purple and blotchy. She just brushed it off.  I went off and on the pill for years. I honestly can't recall for how long I was on or off because I was all over the place. Every time I took the pill, I felt as if I were gaining weight especially in my breasts and I felt awful. Plus, they took my sex drive down to basically nothing which is not pleasing to my long term partner. Every time I was off the pill, my periods completely stopped. I tried not to stay off for too long because of endometriosis risk, but I have been off for about a year and a half now because I was finally fed up with it. My hair has thinned so much that I'm afraid to get back on the pill. I have no idea if it has had any effect on the way I feel and my hair so I'm afraid to try anything before I have some answers! For the past 4 or 5 months I have had my period, on my own, every month. Only god knows why!  Right now, I am experiencing what I think is puffiness in the face, or something. It just seems larger and not like I used to be. These episodes come and go. Sometimes I'll have a few months where my face is thinned out and I look great, and then suddenly it will get all \"masculine\" as I call it again. Everyone tells me I look the same, \"just older\" but I have photos to prove these changing periods throughout the years, back and forth. I know my own body! Also coming with these periods is a lot of bloating. I don't know if there is weight gain. I FEEL like I have but it may just be bloating. And it's all in my abdominal area. I have a pregnant belly during this episodes. And of course I'm fatigued as usual and just feel like general crap.  But why do these boughts come and go? Is that normal for someone with hypo or PCOS? Or am I borderline or something? I exercise and eat well. Also, I seem to have low blood sugar or SOMETHING because I almost always crash after I eat even if it's just a snack. I get very hyper after eating most of the time. Even during my good times I still have excess belly fat, but I'm thin everywhere else. No bloating and distended tummy though like during the bad times, just unproportionally fat there. And another thing, I tend to feel better when I don't eat very much. When I eat maybe 1 medium meal the whole day, the next day I feel better. That's how I grew up, maybe that has something to do with it? I have been eating regularly and sensibly for months (I find nutrition interesting and fun for me) in the hopes that I could speed up my metabolism (I'm exercising too) but all \"eating normally\" has done is made me bloated and \"fat.\" I want so badly to go back to eating very little because it makes me feel so much better. I feel more energetic and free-er... if that makes sense... I actually feel like getting up and stretching and running and ... I feel more mobile. Not as weighed down.  And the last thing that has been happening since I was teenager (10th grade to be exact) are these horrible episodes of TREMENDOUS pain in my lower lower abdomen, always on the right side. Seriously the worst pain ever. It always starts out as a cramp, then gets worse and worse until it reaches its peak by which I've usually taken medicine so it comes down. The pain is not only localized there but spreads almost to... my anus? I don't know how else to describe it. If I try to sit down on my bum, there is a shooting pain up that area where my anus is and through my lower abdomen. The last time this happened was about 2 months ago, and I was in the city without medication. It was by far the worst that I have ever had. I don't know if that is because I didn't take medication right away or what. But I was wishing for death that's for sure. I felt like I had to use the toilet but I tried and didn't have anything. I have these about 5 times a year maybe?  So, there you have it. Sorry it's long, but there are so many things to consider. Thank you so much if you've made it to this point, I greatly appreciate it! Please ANY insight or \"me too\" or ANYTHING would be fantastic. Thank you thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Firstly (for the sake of healthy discussion) let me try and give an alternate explanation for the 'central' obesity of yours. Firstly let us assume that you indeed have PCOS. You say that \"I can still fall asleep at literally any time (with anything going on around me, even loud parties, happens all the time) even though I eat normally.\" If that is the case,can the following happen?  - You sleep most of the time, therefore your resting energy expenditure is likely to be very low (thus whatever 'little' you eat, may happen to be more than your basal needs - thus contributing to obesity) - Your muscles are likely to waste because of under-usage and therefore your limbs are likely to appear comparatively thin - as a part of PCOS, out of the overall obesity, only the central obesity is remaining(central obesity would probably be the last to go).  - your face may look and feel puffy (natural for a person with very irregular sleep patterns + of course PCOS)  You see, i was just trying to connect up some of your clinical features to PCOS (which is perhaps your underlying problem) - so that all most of your symptoms can be brought under one umbrella (PCOS), rather than attributing some of your symptoms and signs to other diseases such as hypothyroidism. cushing's syndrome, Carbon monoxide poisoning and the rest).  Thank you for your interesting post. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Me: I am a 25 year old female who was diagnosed with addison's disease in May 2009. My disease is from adrenal insuficiency (no pituitary problem), and I don't make enough aldosterone.  I am an athlete/fitness trainer/nursing student, and lately have been curious if taking anabolic steroids might help my addison's? I have done quite a bit of research and have put in a lot of thought in using 25mg Deca a week.   My question: Since I am only aldosterone difficient, would a decrease in cortisol still be detramental to me? That is the side effect of taking Deca. Also, would such a low dose make a significant difference?  I have read that the Deca reduces cortisol being absorbed into the muscles...but is this the same as reducing the overall level of cortisol that could hurt me? My thought is that the cortisol would be present - just not absorbed into the muscles.  I do plan on speaking with my personal endocrinologist first before I make the decision whether or not I want to. It all depends if the benefits outweigh the risks.   Thank you for any feedback!\n\n",

    "title": "Hypothyroidism Symptoms persisting with treatment?",
    "content": "I am a 27 yo female who was diagnosed with hypothyroidism via a goiter when I was approximately 12 years old.  I do have a family history of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.  My aunt was successfully treated 10+ years ago.  My mother DNA tested positive for the gene, however I was tested and do not carry the gene. I am currently on 100mcgs dose of Synthroid.  My dosage and blood levels have been consistent for about 8 years.  Being so young at the time of diagnosis I do not remember if I had any of the typical symptoms before I was diagnosed.  My goiter was discovered by my primary care provider during a visit for strep throat.  I saw an endocrinologist immediately and began treatment, no more goiter.  My question is why do I seem to still have a lot of the classic hypothyroidism symptoms?  For several years I have had quite a bit of pain (aching) in my hip joints, cold intolerance (not severe), and fatigue.  I am not always tired but people close to me joke that I have an idle mode.  I just seem to run out of gas at times and fall asleep easily if inactive.  It's gotten to the point that my inability to stay awake/alert irritates my bf frequently.  Is it common to still have such symptoms?  All my research tends to indicate that symptoms should clear up with treatment but mine seem to be persistent.  I have mentioned this to my endocrinologist, but unfortunately, I have had a hard time keeping a consistent doctor (a pregnancy, change in career to research, professional sabbatical) but have stayed in the same medical system.  I am in a healthy weight range, get exercise regularly, and have no other major medical problems.  Blood pressure and cholesterol were recently checked and are very good.  I am also on birth control (my levels were adjusted after I began these) and folic acid supplements.  Is it likely that my symptoms now are resultant from my medically controlled hypothyroidism?  I\n\n",

A substantial number of hypothyroid patients on Thyroxin(tetraiodothyronine or T4) may not be feeling entirely alright despite normalization of their thyroid functions. Some have labeled these symptoms  as 'phantom' symptoms and so on.... Others have looked into this phenomenon more rationally and some studies have shown the benefits of adding T3 (triiodothyronine) to the Thyroxin(T4).  (Endogenously secreted T4 needs to be converted to T3 in the tissues to exert its full biological activity). Adding T3 to T4 appears to add to the quality of life. Good luck!!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Immune responses Thyroid or Adrenal",
    "content": "Hi, It is never a good idea to 'diagnose' a condition by looking at a set of lab results or to suggest 'treatment' without examining a patient. Having said that, i will try to answer in a rather general way about the queries you have raised. In analyzing for example the thyroid functions, one has to consider the following... - what is the normal range? The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists(AACE),issues guidelines periodically.  Many will take a TSH level between 3.0 and 5.0 uU/ml as the normal range.  If one goes by some epidemiological studies,a high thyroid stimulating hormone concentration (>2 mU/l) has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of future hypothyroidism- your test value falls above this range.However, there is no proof as yet that thyroxin is needed in this situation to 'prevent' future risk of Hypothyroidism! Now, coming to the question of thyroxin vs adrenals, adrenal cortical insufficiency may co-exist with hypothyroidism.In some settings (such as in Hashimoto's disease and combined TSH & ACTH deficiency in hypopituitarism etc), thyroxin administration in this set up has been reported to worsen the adrenal cortical insufficiency. As far as the worsening of mitral valve prolapse is concerned, theoratically, the answer is -'possible'--- Perhaps, depending upon which degree of mitral valve prolapse one has. I hope this will somewhat clarify your doubts. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I understand your frustration. You see, PCOS has no single remedy.I understand you were diagnosed in year 2000 as having PCOS.  How strong was the diagnosis? I understand you underwent breast \"Reduction\" surgery in 2000 as well.   Did any of your close relatives had/has PCOS? what is your body weight? If you happen to be obese, are you sincerely trying to reduce weight? (this measure certainly helps). Your main concern appears to be the issue of hirsutism. Have you tried electrolysis or laser treatments? They are much more effective than shaving. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Suffering with Hypo OR Hyperthyroidism?",
    "content": "For the last 4-5 months, my mother, 55, has been having constant diarrhea, heart palpatations, weight loss, trouble sleeping and generally not feeling well. It's causing her great distress, and she just want to understand what's been going on, and what she should ask from her doctor to help her feel well again.  She was diagnosed with hypothyroidism 25+ years ago, and was told to take medication everyday for the rest of her life. Recently her family doctor took her off that medication. After that she started to get these symptoms with the constant diarrhea. She went to her doctor and he attributed it to anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome. Not satisfied with that, she badgered her doctor enough to eventually take a closer look, and with testing found her thyroid levels to be high.   He prescribed her Tapazole and Propranolol, and sent her for a thyroid ultrasound, and mentioned something about checking for grave's disease. She's waiting on the results of that ultrasound now, and has been on the medication for a week, but has seen no change in her symptoms. She's still feeling just as lousy.  We just want to understand better what's going on, and if the doctor is going in the right direction, and what questions she should be asking.  Could all this be caused in the first place by taking her off the medication she's been taking for hypothyroid?  Would it get better if she was placed back on it?  How is it possible that she was diagnosed with hypothyroidism years ago, but now a (different) doctor is looking into hyperthyroidism?  Can this be treated and can she return to her normal, functioning self?  Any insight would be so greatly appreciated, because my mom has been suffering for months, and has had to constantly assert herself to be taken seriously, instead of just being passed off as anxiety.\n\n",

    "content": "Recently I had some heart racing and abnormal beating that led to thyroid testing.  I came up with very low TSH 0.01 w/high Free T4 - 2.64.  I had been out of the country having a good time drinking coffee and wine, etc, which I don't normally do.  A follow up test a week later confirmed TSH < 0.01 Free T4 - 2.02 (coming down), Anti-TPO > 1000, Thryoglobulin AB 79, Total T3 - 260.  However, 2 weeks later, TSH was up to 0.04 and Free T4 was normal @ 1.12.  Total T3 taken a few days later showed that normal @ 97 - although that seems on the low end or normal.  The doc wants me to take the Radioactive Iodine Uptake and Scan which I really don't want.  I am also now having chronic low body temp.  I've been looking at it morning and night for about a week and it ranges from 95.0 to 97.0.  Mostly about 96.  I have not had any more hyper symptoms other than occasional sweats which before I always attributed to menopause.  I have fibroids also but those seem to be shrinking now that I'm into menopause.  Another side note, last spring I had some kind of infection where I had a temp of 104 on 3 separate occassions over a week.  I ended up in the ER where they started me on antibiotics and that finally seemed to kick in.  They said I had a kidney infection but no pain or otherwise symptoms of that.  My PCP said he didn't think I had a kidney infection since the counts(?) were not that high.    I want to take another TSH. Free T4, Total T3 before the RAI test to see if my TSH has risen and hormone levels are still normal.  Would I then be ineligible for the RAI test?  Also, what could cause this hyper condition and then return to normal, but with cold body temp?\n\n",

She had some fluid in the year and was prescribed antibiotics for sinus infection. Blood test was done as a precaution with following results: TSH<0.1mIU/L, free T4=3.8ng/dL and T3=3.5ng/dL. Blood work was repeated 16-Oct: TSH<0.01mIU/L, free T4 =3.8ng/dL, total T3=462ng/dL. On 17th-Oct she had thyroid ultrasound that states: bulky thyroid lobes with heterogeneous echogenicity but no discrete mass. I acquired her past medical records from pediatrician and blood work from Jan-2006 showed: TSH<0.04mIU/L, T3 uptake= 26.6%, free T4 =1.4ng/dL, total T4=6,9ng/dL, Cholesterol=183 - there was no follow-up. Medical history:  1.Weight fluctuations: Ages 11 \u2013 14:  unexpected weight gain (she swam 3-4 hours/day on swim teams). At age 16: weight ~145lb, height 160cm. Between17-18: sudden lost of 50 lbs within < than a year (in July 2008 she was 95lbs). Referred by pediatrician to Eating Disorder Center but psychiatrist with whom she consulted in a Center excluded depression, anorexia or bulimia. In fall 2008 Kat entered Rutgers University and within 3 months gained over 20lbs. She claims that she did not eat more than before and at this point she got depressed and started purging herself after meals. 2.\tIrregular menstrual cycles: frequently missing few months  3.\tPersistent acne: (no improvement even on birth control) 4.\tKidneys/bladder: Ages 3 - 9: recurrent UTIs.

I had the surgery May 13, 2009, I am currently recovering nicely. I hasd one post op with my surgeon and have to wear the compression bandage for another three weeks, then another post op visit.     I had a blood test sent to an Endo, she in turn asked for another one, to test for Prolactin levels. My surgeon informed me the tumor mass taken out of both sides of my chest was the size of my palm! It was quite a large mass. Unsure of the cause of the gyno, and what little knowledge I have compared to the pros, can my gyno return? My appt with the Endo is not until Dec 8, 2009. If escess estrogen caused this mass or excess Prolactin, and it was being deposited at the breat tissue, whats to say that I am still not producing either of these and where is it now being deposited??   P.S. I had noticed gyno when I was about 16 (though I did not know what it was) It was only in the last year that it started hurting. My Father also developed a large chest faster than the rest of him when he was young also. I noticed it when I would carry drywall or plywood and the pressure would cause pain. Also, whenever I got sexually excited, there would be a sharp peircing pain in my nipples.  Any help would be most appreciated. I am currently waiting for the blood tests concerning my Prolactin levels.\n\n",

The mailny glandular variety  contains mainly glandular tissue(but as the surgeon must have removed all of this glandular tissue,it also is unlikely to recur if your prolactin levels happen to be higher than normal.

    "content": "I have been having a very fast heart rate for the past year to year and a half, with a resting HR of anywhere from 120-144.  One time it was nearing 200bpm but it was thought to be a reaction to medication I was taking for neuropathic pain (amitryptiline, followed by Nortriptyline).  I am not longer taking any medication, apart from Iron and B12 (both of which I tested low for).  My thyroid levels appear to be fine but my doctor is testing me for Hashimoto disease anyway because of the prominent history of thyroid disease in my family. He suspects it could be in the beginning stages.  My mom was diagnosed with Graves and two of her siblings have hypothyroid.  My mom's aunt was also hyperthyroid.   My symptoms are not indicative of hypothyroid in my opinion...it is much more like hyper.  I am in overdrive and then I crash; overdrive and crash.  My heart rate is very high and I'm having episodes of SVT.  However, at the same time my holter readings showed that my heart rate slowed to as low as 46 beats per minute while sleeping.  Is Hashimoto's really something that is possible when I have normal TSH and T4 and my symptoms appear more like hyperthyroid?  The tests her ordered were antithyroglobulin and antiperidoxase.  Would these tests only show Hashimoto's or would they also show Grave's disease?    Thanks for your time!\n\n",

Hashimoto's disease sometimes causes an initial  hyperthyroid state and later on, a hypothyroid state.  Thyroid antibodies are not specific to either.They could occur in both these disorders. Some tend to believe that both these disorders are varied manifestations of the same disease process. Thank you for visiting Doctors lounge.\n\n",

Problem is, I've started losing weight again....8 pounds in 3 months without trying.  I don't have any other of the symptoms I had last year except for the weight loss.  Does this mean I should go off the Synthroid to see if my thyroid is functioning by itself again?  I feel fine except I can't afford to lose too much weight.  Thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "What is \"natural progesterone\"?  I was not aware a product existed like this?  Is it over the counter?  Herbal?  I would suggest you just get rid of that stuff with all the problems you are already having and be sure to consult the doctor no matter what.  I would not take the stuff if the doc did not prescribe it.  You already have hormone problems and there is no way to know for sure which hormone you need and what dose unless they run some blood work.  So just keep it natural and let the symptoms do what they do until you see the doc.   Also this could be a menopause problem at the age of 42.   Sounds also like you need something for the anxiety.  Alot of what you are describing almost sounds like premenstrual dysphoric disorder or some serious PMS.  It could be the first one and not PMS. Please consult a doc in person and don't take anything the doc does not know about.  Alot of the herbal meds are good, but they are really just like taking a drug.  Because they are not prescription, many people think they are harmless.  But they must be used properly and realize too that they can interact with medicaitons.  Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

It seems my insulin levels were ok, but my Blood sugar level stayed about the same throughout all the testing.  I don't understand what that means.  It should have increased significantly during the 1 hr testing.  Does it mean my body doesn't process sugar properly?  Should I use certain diet restrictions?  I'm having trouble losing weight...could this have anything to do with it?  Fasting   Glucose=78  Insulin=6.8 1 hour    Glucose=72   Insulin=59.3 2 hours   Glucose=69  Insulin=40.3\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  What I infer from your two-hour GTT is that you are hypoglycemic. This can be a simple \"it is what it is\" issue, or it often is consider a pre-diabetic metabolic lesion which means it may suggest a future with type II diabetes potential. While the most recent \"normal\" serum glucose levels have been lowered several times so that your fasting 78 would now merely be considered normal range, it is actually pretty low and some  people would have difficulty functioning with that level. Then after the glucola swallow it dropped a little more, and the dropped to just under what is considered normal. Since 70 - 100 is now considered normal (something I have trouble understanding, frankly), your test would technically be very near normal, and it is probably not a reason for any concern. You certainly cannot be called diabetic by any standard. Whether or not this low reading suggests hypglygemia and a possible increased risk (along with your family history) of diabetes, for now, so long as you have no symptoms of hypoglycemia, I would just follow this conservatively for the time being. You did have a pretty big insulin response to the dose, so may actually have hyperinsulinic hypoglycemia, the sometimes-predictor of future diabetes, but you just seem to have a very tightly-regulated blood sugar metabolism which, for now at least, should be treated as a gift.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "For jkmeyer: It would seem your 2-hour GTT suggests what's now known as pre-diabetes. At this point, and at your age, this can often be managed completely with diet and exercise. There may also be the possibility of something called metabolic syndrome, which is a complex of statuses and findings including elevated but not-diabetic glucose levels (the current diagnostic standard is glucose at or above 126 in consecutive random fasting checks, so you're not there yet); metabolic syndrome is often associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, as is confirmed diabetes (a new standard is being considered, using hemoglobin A1C level instead of the two random 126+ findings), but since you're not officially diabetic based on the GTT, you should be counseled on diet, exercise and weight control to bring your levels back down to normal, which is usually possible and is highly desireable. Good luck to you and please follow up with us if you have any further questions.\n\n",

    "title": "Is tingling a symptom of a thyroid problem?",
    "content": "Hello.  I'm a 35 year old female.  I have been having a few problems lately that my doctors don't seem to have an explanation for.  I'm wondering if there is a problem with my thyroid, or something, that they are possibly not seeing.  When I looked up the symptoms for hypothyroidism online, I felt like I was reading a discription of myself, with the exception of brittle hair.  My hair is dry, but it's not terribly brittle.  My skin is always terribly dry and itchy.  It's also very sensitive to soaps.  I'm always exhausted. I feel cold a lot of the time.  Up until a couple of years ago, I was always the hot one in a bunch.  My menstrual cycle is very heavy for the first 3 days, then it's ok after that.  I experience a lot of vaginal dryness and have no sex drive.  Also, there are times when I have a slightly green discharge.  I had a miscarriage in January, my 3rd one.  I have had 4 healthy pregnancies.  I've seen my OB/GYN about all of this, and he did a pap/smear and a culture, along with other blood tests because of my symptoms and the miscarriage.  He said the results were normal.    At this time, I was tested for diabetes and thyroid disfunction.  The doctor said that all test results were normal.  I didn't write down the specific numbers.  After reading the posts on this forum, I wish I had written the results down.  I have also had a lot of gastro- intestinal problems.  That doctor did a lot of tests, including a colonoscopy, and diagnosed me with mild IBS.  During an abdominal ultrasound, the doctor discovered that I have a renal cyst.  Although it has grown in size over the course of a year, the doctor said that it isn't a problem yet and that I should get it checked in another year.  My urine seems to be very acidic.  If I don't drink a lot of water, my urine really irritates my skin.  I've been dealing with my symptoms ok until about 3 weeks ago.  My hands and feet started tingling about 3 weeks ago.  The tingling isn't necessarily a 'pins and needles' type of tingling, as it's not really painful, but it's very prominent and 'loud'.  It is very irritating and worrisome. After a few days, the tingling started progressing up my calves. Since then, I find that at times my entire body tingles, including the front of my neck and up onto my face and mouth.  I feel like my body is more weak since this started.  My knees feel like they are wobbly going down stairs or when bending over to do something. My calves, along with my right knee have been a little swollen, too.  Sometimes I feel like I'm trembling, but I can't actually see my body trembling.  Also, I'm having pains/ tightness in my muscles of my calves, lower arms, hands, and shoulders.  I've been having a hard time falling asleep since this started.  I don't sleep well, anyway, and this situation certainly isn't helping matters.  I really don't know which direction to go as far as seeking more medical help, but I know I need help.  Do you think this is a thyroid problem, a diabetic problem, or a neurological disorder?  And why would my tests come back 'normal' when I have felt 'off' for so long?  Thank you for any advice you can offer.\n\n",

    "content": "Wow, you have many of the same symptoms I have/have had in the past.  I am so glad to read that there are actually quite a few others who have had the tingling.  I did as well.  I had a sudden onset of symptoms last year which started with tingling in the feet.  It felt like beestings.  The tingling moved up my legs and my arms.  Then it moved into my face as well.  It got the the point where it felt like someone slapped me in the face.  My legs at this time also wobbled and I had one weird symptom after another.  I had my menstrual period for a month straight.  I had MANY more symptoms but won't post them all here.  What finally happened was I blacked out in the shower.  My vision went blurry.  I went to the ER and was sent to see a Neurologist who tested me for MS, Lyme disease, and numerous other diseases, only to find that I have antibodies for both Graves and Hashimotos.  Long story short is that my Endocrinologist says the tingling couldn't be from the thyroid.  My nuerologist says yes it can.  Since I experienced it - I will say yes it can.  I still have tingling here & there.  It usually comes on with adrenaline rushes when I get it now; however with the Hashimoto's I think my levels bounce from low to high.  Maybe that's how MY body deals with it...who knows.  However, I will not believe a doctor who tells me that it's not from the disease until he/she can PROVE otherwise!  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I am 27. When I was about 16 I passed out one day at school. I went to the Dr. and they did blood tests and everything, diabetes test & all, turned out normal. Ever since that day, a few times a year I would sometimes have episodes of my fingers going numb. It usually would last about 10 minutes and then be back to normal. This past year or 2 my episodes are a bit different and more frequent. They start out with my vision being distorted. I will be feeling totally fine but all of a sudden I'll notice that when I look at other people's faces, they look really strange and distorted. This will last 5-10 minutes then go away. About 10-15 minutes after that I will get a really bad headache and start feeling extremely exhausted. This usually lasts the rest of the day. These episodes happen in this exact order every single time and this year I have been having them about once a month. I have thought for the longest time that it may be that I am hypoglycemic. I have not been tested for it but I've read a little bit on it and think that could possibly be it. It's just really strange that this is getting to be so frequent and it's starting to worry me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Have you ever had a complete neurological workup since this has been going on? It is of course impossible to do more than guess at a distance, but what you describe sounds a good deal like it could be a form of seizure you're experiencing, from having passed out in school years ago to having episodes of visual distortion followed by headache and fatigue. This is roughly one possible form of partial seizure, including the post-tictal headache and tiredness. It would make a lot more sense than hypoglygemia, although, of course, that hasn't been ruled out and is a remote possibility.   An electroencephalogram (EEG) with stroboscopic attempt to induce seizure would be a good starting point, after, of course, a history and physical (H&P) with a consulting neurologist. I just have a suspicion this is more neurological than endocrinological. You certainly ought to also have at least a 3 hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) to rule hypoglycemia in or out, but regardless of that result, I strongly believe a neurological workup would still be in order.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "That is very interesting that you mention seizures because when I was very young, about 8 years old, I had several tests, including an EEG done to see if I had seizures. My teacher at the time noticed that I would blank out all of a sudden in class and my grades had suddenly dropped tremendously.  The first doctor we went to suggested that I had some form of seizure where you just blank out? I'm not sure if this is exactly how it was described but it's how I remember it as a child. Then our insurance  changed and we switched doctors. That doctor did and EEG and I believe maybe a cat scan as well. He said that I did not have seizures. So I have never been sure. The first doctor had me on Ritalin for a while and the new doctor had taken me off of it. I had never again noticed the spacing out symptoms.  I will see about finding a neurologist.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Well you have just described, in almost textbook fashion, what are known as \"absence seizures\" or petit mal epilepsy. In these (early) seizures the patient  is unaware anything has happened, and since it is usually a young  person it affects the learning process  adversely, grades suffer, and often the child  is accused of \"daydreaming\" or having attention deficit disorder. It was  always treatable, although the available drugs now are more effective.   I thnk it would be totally appropriate for you to be seen by a neurologist, have another (provocative strobe) EEG, and I would almost be willing to bet you are experiencing some sort of seizure activity now, probably partial seizures.   Thanks for the additional information. I hope this is all helpful. Please let us know what you find out. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

This is a very atypical but non-unheard of reaction to either of the above problems and obviously would be very disturbing, so I'd start with the neurological evaluation and then, if necessary, overlap it with a cardiology consult.

I have been on anti-seizures medications my whole life, two different kinds (Zarontin and Zonegran), both of which a side effect is Lupus.  I was diagnosed with Lupus two years ago.  At the beginning of this year, I started having chronic symptoms of nausea and diarrhea, and some other subtle symptoms.  I was diagnosed with Celiac's disease.  Celiac can actually cause petit mal seizures, which I believe to have caused the seizures when I was a child.  Neurological symptoms of Celiacs often present themselves with Celiacs years before any gastrointestinal symptoms do.  Maybe you should get yourself checked out. I have read on a few sites, that a golden rule should be that anyone diagnosed with Epilepsy should be also tested for Celiac disease. Celiac is an autoimmune disorder, once thought of as rare, but occurs as often as 1 in 100 people.  Eating gluten will wreak havoc on your body.  People with this disease may not have any symptoms, which is dangerous.  They may not have any symptoms until later in life.  They may have symptoms their whole life and go undiagnosed.  You should check it out.\n\n",

    "content": "During middle/high school and for some of my adult life I have been a sleep walker/talker and have had a few instances of night terrors.  During highschool I was on the wrestling team and in a tournament hit my head very hard in a way that my spine would take all the force of the impact.  On the way home my vision in my right eye became distorted as if someone had taken a knife and carved a very jagged line through it.  I'm not sure now whether it was followed by a head ache as I was pretty sore and disoriented.  Since then and more often recently I have been experiencing the same issue along with a crippling head ache that seems to go away a little when I lay down.  I thought it was because of physical activity (I ride a bike to work) but it is not a constant.  It can happen when I'm just sitting around.  When it does happen I cannot read without a great deal of concentration and that intensifies the headache.  My vision looks as if I am looking through a broken window with water running accross it.  During work today; however, I started to feel very exhausted at work accompanied by aggitation, and slight depression.  That was before the onset of the vision and headache issues.  I have not had the oportunity to analyze this before so I am not sure if that is a precurser to the episodes I am having.  My doctor has told me to see a neurologist but there are none in the town I live in and I don't currently drive.\n\n",

    "title": "I need help/education/support- pituitary tumor",
    "content": "I knew something was wrong for a few years- everyone called it post-pardum depression... my daughter is 3 and I was still lactating, very depressed, gaining weight like crazy. I went from 100lbs and petite to 200lbs in 3 years. FInally my mother, who was tired of watching me suffer, forced me to make an apt for therapy. I went, thinking I must be mental, long story short, and after a few different appointments, I found myself in the chair at the endocrinologists office. Without doing anything more than some blood work, I was put on Dostinex to stop the lactating, no mri, all my blood work was normal. After a few weeks i stopped lactating, and honestly felt amazing and like my old self (minus the crazy amount of weight I had gained). I went for my 10 week check up and the doctor told me he was keeping me on the medicine and would see me back in another ten weeks. Literally, thats all he said before I was on me way back home. This upset me a little bit. The Dostinex, while working wonders, was also making me gain MORE weight!! I was also not healing. Any scratch, cut, pimple, etc... for the past ten weeks, had not healed at all. And I was experiencing bruising all around the wounds. I researched the pill, thinking maybe it was a steroid, hence gaining 15 lbs in the first ten weeks (40 total since Jan- despite my physical and dietary measures to help control this). The pill was referred to as the typical medicine that is used to treat pituitary tumors. The doctor had mentioned this as a possibility prior to my blood work coming back normal, and wasn't brought up again. I decided to switch doctors, tired of being in some alien body for 3 years, needing an advocate to help me get my life back. The next doctor seemed amazing at first. Right off the bat I was scheduled for an MRI and a list of blood work. MRI confirmed I had a 6mm tumor. This is the frustrating part... had it shrunk from the 7 months of Dostinex treatment? Was it still growing? Staying the same? I had no clue because there were no tests back in Jan. Also, the new doctor's blood labs (very thorough) all came back fine as well. How can this be? I have a tumor- we saw it... but every single test was fine? again? I was told by the new doctor that he had no intention in surgery, would keep me on the Dostinex for another year (ignoring my cries about the weight gain, body wounds, my hands and feet are growing wider as we speak, my face and nose seem to be spreading as well. etc) So here I find myself scheduling with a THIRD doctor (I hate that I'm jumping doctors, I'm very passive typically but I am desperate for finding an advocate), trying to find someone to take this dang thing out and heal me  Everywhere I read it seems like surgery is really typical, easy, successful. I don't understand why the hesitation, and no one is explaining anything. ALSO: My mother was reading up and found something about Cushings Disease. OH MY GOODNESS! This is EXACTLY me!!!! http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cushin ... e/DS00470/ DSECTION=symptoms But my levels were all normal? Always! Even when I was lactating, normal, normal, normal! So my doctor shrugged me off when I asked if this could be a possibility. Has anyone experienced false levels on blood work? PLEASE help me if you have a similar story, PLEASE! I feel like everyday I'm gaining more weight, fighting harder to increase activity, reduce calories, educated myself more, pray to God that someone will figure this out, lead me to the right answers, and help me get my life back. I am 29 years old and I lost my youth & my beauty to this and honestly my spirit is slipping away with it, too.  By the way, I haven't had a period at all since being on the dostinex except once after missing a pill for two days. Is this normal? My doctor said it should be regulating me, but as is everything else, my body is being stubborn and hypocritical of everything the doctors said I should be experiencing.\n\n",

    "title": "16 year old male secondary hypothyroid/gonadism help please",
    "content": "I had some blood work done because for the past year I have been feeling the following symptoms: Fatigue, weakness, constant hunger, cold body temperature, frequent urination and overall lack of enjoyment in everything I used to do. The blood work came back with extremely low tesosterone, high cortisol, and little pituitary function. What triggered all of this happened a year ago in the summer of 2008. Starting the summer around June I weighed 130 lbs and just got done competing at state wrestling.  When that was over I decided to cut down for next year right away to have a better chance at doing better in wrestling. I started eating less and less, and eventually all I ate was mostly protein, verry little carbohydrates, and little to no fats at all. All of this ended around September, so from June-September around four months  I had pretty much developed an eating disorder from my favorite sport. I was naturaly lean anyway. Not only that but I am losing weight but gaining that bodyfat... I don't understand if the low tesosterone and growth hormone is causing bone and muscle loss, but I lift three times a week at the school and have not noticed many strength losses, I just can never get any stronger. It kills me to know that everything I do will only make me worse, I have no idea how to correct this hypothalamic/pituitary problem. It would mean so much to me if you could help me with this, I think my doctor is running out of ideas for me. He has sent me to an endocrineologist in Des Moines, IA and she took seven serums of bloodwork showing all this. I should probably tell you that I'm not Nutritionally defecient in any way, I eat around 2,000 calories a day full of the right protein, carbohydrates, and fats. I even supplement healthy fats like fish oil omegas to try to help it. I take a multi-vitamin and an extra b-vitamin complex everyday to try and help. Nothing works. Not only did all of this mess with my quaility of life, my favorite sport, wrestling, is now being taken away from me because I don't have the energy to practice or compete...  Have you ever heard of hypocaloric diets causing low testosterone, luetinizing hormone, tsh,  and t4 free? Last summer I had lost 15 lbs from a healthy weight to  being 15 lbs underweight. My levels go as follows:  Total Testosterone- 82 ng/dl  LH- 2.2 miU/ml range (1.5-9.3) T4 free 0.8 ng/dl range (0.8-1.8) ACTH 23 pg/ml normal with cortisol Normal Comp Metabolic Panel for everything tested Prolactin 6.3 ng/ml range (2.6-18.1) IGF-1- 243 range (257-601) Androstendione-82 range (44-186) TSH-1.336 range (0.350-5.500)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi kailey, The symptoms of MS are varied, depending on which nerves are affected. Some of the signs and symptoms of MS may include: dizziness and loss of balance, fatigue, hand or leg weakness, inflammation of nerves in the eye, localized tingling or numbness, a stabbing pain in the face, visual impairments, including blurred or double vision. As the disease gets worse, other symptoms may develop, such as, bowel and bladder problems, chronic pain, such as back and muscle pain, depression,  muscle spasms, which can be quite painful, paralysis, sexual dysfunction, slurred speech and difficulty swallowing,  trouble with thinking and memory, visual loss, including blindness etc.  Diagnosis of MS is done by a complete history and physical exam. A cranial MRI may show evidence of damage to the myelin coating of the brain, but keep in mind that one can also have a normal MRI. If in this case, a spinal tap may be done to obtain cerebrospinal fluid is examined for evidence of immune system problems. MS is sometimes diagnosed by ruling out all other possible causes for the symptoms. The basic rule for diagnosing MS has two criteria - two attacks of MS symptoms, at least 1 month apart. More than one area of damage to the myelin sheath of the nerve, without evidence of other disease that could damage the myelin.  As for the Fibromyalgia, don't have the misconception that it's a psychological illness. It's an illness with physical symptoms and  the cause is unknown. You may at some point want to check out this website: http://www.fibromyalgia-symptoms.org/ I hope this is helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Dear kailey, Rntdj forwarded your post to me. It would be wrong to make any conclusions about what you saw in the MRI. For one thing an MRI scan is very difficult to interpret. Even among radiologists, only one with enough experience in MRI would be able to report on the scan. There are many things to be taken into consideration when interpreting an MRI:  1. If contrast is used in the cut you mentioned. 2. Whether the cut is a a T1-weighted image or a T2 weighted image.   Rntdj, has already outlined some of the criteria required to diagnose MS. I assure you that your radiologist will look for the MS criteria when examining a MRI of the brain.  In the MRI diagnostic criteria are as follows: You need 3 out of 4 of the following (Barkhof et al and Tintore et al):   1 Gd+ (contrast emhanced) lesion or 9 T2 hyperintense lesions  1 infratentorial lesion  1 juxtacortical lesion  3 periventricular lesion (1 spinal cord lesion = 1 brain lesion)   To suspect MS you would need to show two or more seperate neurological lesions that are disseminated in time or space. These need to be objective neurological lesions such as sensory loss, paresis or paralysis etc...  I do not think you have any of those. I got the impression your manifestations were more in the category of lack of volition, excessive fatigue that does not subside on rest. As Rntdj has pointed out, if your tests are all normal and you have excluded most of the organic causes of easy fatiguability then I would consider a diagnosis of depression. Depression does not mean that you do not have anything or that you are insane in any way. It also does not mean that you must have a problem in your social life to be diagnosed with depression. On the contrary, endogenous depression is the worst type and does not result from an external source. Science has demonstrated that depression is a chemical disturbance in the brain cells just as any other disease in the body is. Mind you this does not mean that I have diagnosed you with depression, it would be impossible to do so over the internet. However, I would put it on the top of the list.   If this were to be the case a short course (couple of months) of antidepressants would help alot. Let me know if this has been previously explored. I am sure this possibility must have come across someone elses mind.  Fibromyalgia as Rntdj has mentioned is another possibilty. Again, please take your MRI scans with you and have your doctor evaluate it for you.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "thanks for responding to the posts that i have written-- i appreciate your feedback. yes i have taken zoloft 50mg before for long periods of time -- and other antidepressent medicines to see if this is the problem -- but what happens is that the medications actually seem to exaberate the symptoms-- not so much the muscle aches and twitches -- but the fatigue-- i have a really hard time functioning on that medication so i did stop using it. i understand what you are saying about maybe depression being a part of it -- but honestly i don't feel depressed in any way. i had taken the zoloft in the past becuase that was what the doctor thought before might be the problem-- but like i said it actually make my tiredness 20x worse. for some reason when i take that medication -- no matter what time --becuase i switched times to see if that would help-- i would constantly be yawning-- i mean to the point that i would yawn with a feeling of needing to stretch out all the time -- then again and agian --the feeling was alwys there-- it was quite uncomfortable-- i was told that those side effects would subside and after staying on the medications they never did -- and it became unbearable for me. one thing though in the past i was told that i had low b12 levels and i took supplements without much relief--some but not much-- and havent had the levels checked since but still have the problem-- my mennstrul cycle hasd never been right i have gone for a year before without having a period but recently i started to get them once every other month -- and i have to say that before i get it -- i face overwehlming tiredness --where i cannot even function --its unbearable -- so maybe could someone be anemic and times and then somehow other times have ok readings -- just wondering -- thanks again--conc3erning the mri -- i totally agree that im not one to interpret the mri-- i was just wondering becuase i saw something in the same spot as my headaches--it was a bright spot on top of my eyebrowand through the eye socket but who am i to say that was something becuase i was tol,d by my doctor before i had an mri -- that that space in the area im talking about is bone-- so maybe it was just air pockets or something else-- forget that though becuase im not one to interpret that your right-- please let me know though about what i said about the b12 and zoloft thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Kailey, Depression in your case is a diagnosis of exclusion. It can be a cause or an effect as you have stated. Generally however there are two forms of depression:   Reactive depression which occurs in reaction to a social event. Endogenous depression which is more serious and is the result of a chemical disturbance.  In the past and to some extent today depression is still a diagnosis of exclusion. That is you do not diagnose it as the sole cause of a patient's symptoms except after excluding every possible organic cause by investigations. However, there are strict diagnostic criteria for diagnosis of depression. You may review our depression page for more information on the diagnostic criteria which are no less elaborate than those for say MS above.\n\n",

    "content": "Yes this is a common complaint. Antidepressants making it worse usually means that  you are not taking the drug that is 'right' for you. It may also mean that you need a combination of antidepressants. This is usually something that a psychiatrist would have to do. Whether cause or effect I am glad we both agree that you have a depression of some sort. That entails that it should be treated.  The B12 deficiency is quite a significant finding if it were tested using a serum level. If however, this is only speculation from the results of your blood count then it should be repeated and if significant further investigated.  B12 deficiency can be a result of dietary deficiency but can also be the result of more serious issues. Before giving you a whole list of new things to worry about I would prefer if you can put the nature of the B12 test on these posts if available or do a repeat blood count first.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dietary sources of vitamin B12 are primarily meats and dairy products. In a typical Western diet, a person obtains approximately 5 to 15 mcg of vitamin B12 daily, much more than the recommended daily allowance of  2 mcg. Normally, humans maintain a large vitamin B12 reserve, which can last two to five years even in the presence of severe malabsorption.14 Nevertheless, nutritional deficiency can occur in specific populations. Elderly patients with \"tea and toast\" diets and chronic alcoholics are at especially high risk. The dietary limitations of strict vegans make them another, less common at-risk population.   As I said earlier if you have results showing a definite vitamin B12 deficiency then it is not enough to just take replacement therapy. A cause needs to be sought. I would go as far as a Schilling test if needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear kailey, In medicine there are two categories of symptoms: specific and nonspecific. Fatigue is a nonspecific symptom so are all your other symptoms. These type of symptoms are nonspecific in that they can be due to a multitude of things spanning a range from 'normal' to severely dangerous causes. The attitude in these difficult clinical cases is to conduct a battery of investigations guided by the clinical examination to rule out the serious causes. All your tests came out normal which is great! Now what is left is two options: either this is one of the less dangerous diseases or a dangerous one in a very early stage. There are no clues to work on here. The only option left is a wait and see policy. Sad as it is we do not always have the solution. During this wait and see policy I strongly suggest you visit a psychiatrist as I explained earlier depression is a diagnosis of exclusion and we have basically excluded all the other causes. Even if you did not feel better on your previous therapy I still recommend that you get evaluation by an experienced psychiatrist. There are two reasons which justify this decision:   1. That it is the last thing that we must exclude (especially that the symptoms justify a diagnosis of depression). 2. That depression may be a cause or effect. Meaning that they may the causative disease (cause) or a complication of an unkown causative disease (effect).  While you are taking therapy, you should be followed up carefully for the possibility of new symptoms and signs, as the possiblity of a different diagnosis will always exist. Hopefully, you wont have any symptoms at all while on proper medication.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "well doctor-thanks for the response. i agree with you but i also disagree (im sure you figured that)  anyways--i wanted to tell you that its true --maybe im depressed -- but yet if thats the case then this must be something that i have been living with for a long time becuase i do not \"feel\" depressed in anyway. i understand that i need to rule it out-but i will tell you that anyone that has been around me would tell you that i am the least likely person to seem depressed--and my general practitioner agrees that she doesnt feel it is depression wither-just unfortunetly, for the symtoms--and i understand \"nonspecific\" happened to not be diagnosed as anything because nothing is coming back on the tests as a \"flag.\" well i do appreciate you keeping in touch with me though and offering your input--i do take into great consideration--my doctor did say though that if i do have chronic fatigue syndrome (aside from the facial issue--the other symptoms) then its hard to diagnose and that normally to treat it anti-depressents are used. that would be fine, but in the past ive tried different ones and i do like zoloft 50mg the best --yet i really feel my tiredness is exaggerated on these medications-so how do i deal with that? also--in response to the face --it could be that i just had some wierd virus i was thinking -- that has never happened before and i hope it doesnt again becuase it was very strange-- in response to a physciatrist--i don't know what i would have to tell one--i don't feel like theres anything abnormal in my life to make me depressed--i don't drink --never have and i don't take drugs--i do smoke cigarettes but don't tell that is a sign of depression   ok well thank you for putting up with me for the last few weeks and the good news is --nothing is showing up to be devastatingly wrong-- and like i said maybe i had a wierd virus before that exaggerated many of my symptoms or something--i have been feeling pretty good latley --last few days and im not as tired so maybe your right --maybe just hearing that everything is fine from the tests has actually made me feel better- and if that is the case then depression is a consideration that ill have to think about--yet its not an easy thing to accept when i cant figure out why i would be. thank you very much i appreciate all your time --now go take some questions from people that really could use your help\n\n",

    "content": "I found this posting, though many years later. I wanted to see if you ever figured this out. I only ask, because you have all of the symptoms of something much simpler then what was mentioned. A food allergy. If you're still experiencing any of these problems, I'm apt to ask... have you been tested for gluten intolerance? I am no doctor, but I have been through similar issues. At one point my doctor and I decided I was depressed, and she prescribed the usual antidepressants to find one that worked. I had a similar problem with this. As I to believe that if you are depressed, there is more to it then taking a pill and calling it a day. I felt my depression was only a result of my lack of sleep, and constant pains. The insomnia was interrupting my routines, making me late for work, or irritable with others. The point is, I understood what you were trying to say.\n\n",

    "title": "Angiodema due to hormone levels?",
    "content": "My symptoms all started when I had my third c-section in November of last year. Everything went fine with pregnancy, but after the c-section I had sever menstral bleeding and stomach cramps. I went to the ER numberous occasions for pain. They could never find anything out of the ordinary. Finally in March 08 my OB did a laproscopy to see if they could find anything. They found sever scar tissue wrapped around my bladder and uterus and removed it. But did not find the cause, the pain was more sever then before so the OB went in again in April 08 and found endomitriosis. New symptoms started appearing everything smelling bad, dizziness, Migrains (on one side of the head at a time starting from the back of the head crawling up to behind the eye), inability to hold bladder, nausea, felt like I was swallowing a rock everytime I swallowed, excessive weight gain, pain under my rib cage left side, inablitiy to concentrate, fatigue (could sleep all day), weakness in my legs and arms, neck pain. Found out the pain under left rib cage is a swollen spleen (no doctor can figure out why). Has been swollen twice the size of a normal spleen since February 08. No sign of sickness. Went to a Reumatologist (have been checked for all soft tissue diseases) and auto immune disorders. In April I receive Depo provera shot, seems that is when the Migrains may have started, and aslo the throat swelling. on 4/27/2008 went to the hospital for sever migrain and was given Tramadol, Benadryl and Compazine (seemed to help a little, just wanted to go home.) Went home and went to bed, 15 hours later woke up with a little headache, drank some coffee, felt like my throat was burning (like I was getting a sore throat), then my nose started closing up, had a hard time catching my breath, (called an ambulance after the tongue was swollen). This all happened within 15 minutes. Here is the report from the ER Visit we still can not figure out what happened I went to an allergist and am not allergic to the coffee.   Neurologic Status- The patient had remained alert, oriented, and with a non focal exam. She had been complaining of a new onset of headaches approximately one to two days prior to admission which had peristed. She had been seen in the emergency room as previously outlined. Because of ongoing headaches, a head CT was performed which showed cerebellar tonsillar ectopia consistent with a borderline Chiari I morphology without evidence of hydrocephalus or significant deformity of the cervicomedullary junction or upper cervical cord. There was a mild prominence of subarachnoid space of the cranial vertex.  No subdural collectons noted. Because of the changes seen on th CT, an MRI of the brain was preformed. There was mildly prominent subarachnoid spaces overlaying the cervical convexities bilaterally. This likely represents a normal anatomic variant.There is tonsillar ectopia measuring up to 1 cm without evidence of associated hydrocephalus. There is no evidence of dural thickening or enhancement. The study was otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary Status \u2013The patient had acute tongue and throat swelling. She was examined in the emergency room and had minimal swelling and bogginess of the tongue and the uvula. The etiology of the angiodema was not clear but she had drank coffee. The patient did not have any other exposures that she could recall. She did receive medications in the ER The day before.   Cardivascular status The patient initially was tachycardic after receiving subcu epi. Her hemodynamics improved and were stable throughout the hospital course.  GI- The patient has cronic abdominal pain in part felt to be secondary to endometriosis. She is on chronic narcotics. Her outpatient medication regimen was started with the exception of NSAIDs which could potentially cause angiodema. The patient will follow up with he primary care physician.   5. GU Renal function remains stable.  Endocrine. No acute endocrine issues.  Infection Disease- As part of admission to the ICU, a nasal swab was obtained for MRSA. The patient did have a positive for MRSA. No signs or symptons of active infection.   Well this is the report I have been seeking answers from all sorts of specialist to find out what is exactly wrong with me. The only thing that is consistent in the blood tests is reactive lymphocytes of 7. I just seem to be getting more fatigued and a migrain atleast once a week. I got the Depoprovera about 4 weeks before the angiodema attack. I have gained 40lbs since, and my face has broken out with pimples. Also every month around my menstraul period I will break out with welts on my face. No one can figure this out please help..\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, i've been experiencing problems for some time, and have not yet found the cause. I have paid privately for lots of tests. The last ones i tried were normal except my insulin levels were low (4.4uIU/ml, the lab range was 6-24.). My fasting glucose is usually around 100mg/dL. c-PEPTIDE WAS 1ng/ml, lab range said less than 4. i did notice that my potassium was only just in the range, it was 3.66mEq/L, THE LAB RANGE WAS 3.60-5.20. i HAVE A HEALTHY DIET, HAVE NO EATING DISORDERS, and have had no stomach upsets. I also have been using a salt substitute regularly, but not in all foods. I thought that these light salts were high in potassium, so i should not have low levels. I have been having frequent tachycardia, it's pretty often that my heart rate is 99 bpm, one day it was 110. I also feel like i get an irregular rhythm, my blood pressure meter has recorded this. I lost the cervical curve of my neck due to muscle spasms. I think something goes wrong with my blood glucose levels too, i get hypoglycaemic symptoms, and feel better if i eat something. I have tried measuring my blood glucose when i feel like this, but it only came out low once, when it was 3.9mmol, every other time i measure randomly it is around 6mmol. I feel tired all the time, sometimes breathless. I just don't know what to do, i know i don't feel right, but my partner thinks i am a hyperchondriac. I get a lot of bachache too. Hope you can help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Dr Haider, Thanks very much for your reply, it's appreciated. I have not been diagnosed as a diabetic, so i am not taking any medication.( A friend is diabetic, and lent me a meter, as they thought i may have some kind of sugar problem, also i had fasting glucose checked by a lab, it was 100 Mg/dL 2 times. I was told by a doctor to measure my blood pressure regularly, as i did have mild hypertension. It changes a lot, for a few weeks it was around 140/90, but then it suddenly dropped, and now it is ok, in fact pretty low sometimes, eg. 110/65. My heartrate has never dropped below 80 in the past 2 months, and is usually over 90 when just resting.I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT GOES TO WITH EXERTION. Sometimes i can't tell it's fast, but often i feel like it's beating fast or too hard, or like it misses a beat.( AND SOME NIGHTS I CANNOT GET TO SLEEP BECAUSE OF IT) My meter recorded an irregular rhythm a couple of times, when it did this my pressure was 130/110 and 135/105! I am not taking blood pressure medication. I do sometimes go dizzy when i stand up after sitting for some time. Also, my lower legs swell in the evening, but they feel hard rather than puffy, and when i wake in the morning they are ok, but my fingers are swollen! The irregular rhythm happens without exertion. I hope this helps, hope to hear from you. Thankyou.\n\n",

There's little to do however other than ask for a second opinion,  since your doctor I'm sure has her reasons for wanting to wait a while longer. If you do, in fact, have parathyroid disease, the kidneys may be insulted again and again by formation of stones, without primary kidney disease being present, so I agree, it does seem somewhat backward, but I hate to second guess an MD. A second opinion might be your best bet.\n\n",

    "title": "complications with anxiety after testosterone therapy",
    "content": "Okay, please bear with me. I suffer from depression. And though I don't suffer from constant anxiety, I can get severe and uncontrollable anxiety that is triggered by something while I am depressed.  I am one of the usual suspects who have taken proper steps to treat depression, but when he feels good, thinks he can make it without the medicine. In the past 60 mg of Prozac has kept my level and feeling fine. And I am fortunate that the generic for it only costs 4 dollars a bottle at Wal Mart. I thank God for that. But I let myself get off of it.  Earlier this year I began feeling fatigue and my doctor had a blood work done on me. He found that I had low testosterone. .200 for a 33 year old man. He put me on testosterone therapy, using Testim gel. H8is belief was that among other things, higher levels of testosterone could benefit my depression situation. At first I did feel very good. But then aggressive, and difficulty breathing followed by anxiety came. My last visit which was two Tuesdays ago, I took the shot instead of the gel so I can taper off of the testosterone. He also put me back on the Prozac, but said it will take time for it to take full effect and so he prescribed me low dosage of Xanax, .5 mg, and told me that the Xanax was only a band aid to get me through. That the Prozac was the medicine that should bring me out of it. He also suggested that we stop the testosterone therapy for awhile. This last week I kept waking up with wayy tooo much energy. This morning I finally didn't have that problem, but the feeling of dread came back still! Nothing is threatening me, but yet again, the small feeling of dread that makes my forehead sweat has returned, again.  I have accepted that I will need anti depressants in my life. I will likely take Prozac for as long as it works for me. But I am frustrated that it has been 13 days since the anxiety hit and I still need to take Xanax to get through the day.   How long am I looking at having to have the Xanax before the Prozac takes over completely here? And most importantly, can you explain to me why this has happened after taking testosterone replacement?  Timeline recap- Saturday May 2nd-After two months of testosterone, Anxiety, difficulty breathing, went to ER, they saw nothing wrong with my lungs, prescribed Prozac. Tuesday May 5th- Doctor prescribed Prozac and Xanax, took testosterone shot instead of gel, and am not taking anymore testosterone in near future May 5th through 14th- waking up with way too much energy!!  Friday May 15th- Did not wake up with intense energy, but feeling of dread still arrives.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: complications with anxiety after testosterone therapy",
    "content": "Hi there  --  You ask some very reasonable questions. I'll try to give the best answers I can, given that there are a lot of variables involved here.   First, testosterone supplementation, like many hormone replacement or supplement therapies, can trigger anxiety in those who are already predisposde. So this part makes sense and the temporary withdrawal of it also does. Why then does the feeling of dread continue? Because once chronic anxiety has been bestirred by anything, whether hormones, trauma or depression (and this latter is important and often overlooked), once that door's been opened it can sometimes take a little work to get it shut again. Further, while Prozac (and other SSRI drugs) are often very helpful over the long haul in treating anxiety and panic disorder, it can also, in the early going, provoke more rather than less anxiety, and this is often enough to discourage people looking for immediate relief. The Xanax \"bandaid\" (and it is exactly that) isn't a bad idea, and may offset the initial unpleasant buzz caused by Prozac. Also, Prozac can take 2-3 weeks to become therapeutically effective (and in some cases it just won't work), so you can figure on having to wait upward of a month for signifcant change, if change via Prozac is going to happen. A better bandaid drug might be one that's longer lasting, like Klonopin, which is a twice-a-day therapeutic drug, rather than Xanax's 4-6 hour help, which can often wear off during sleep and allow that waking up with dread. Xanax is much better as a \"rescue\" drug for use in aborting panic attacks.   If Prozac utlimately works, great. If not, Klonopin (clonazepam) is a very good alternative, twice-a-day dosing medication that generally has few side effects.   The hallmark of generalized anxiety, whether linked to depression or not (and they often do go hand in hand) is its innapropriateness, the fact that nothing bad is actually going on. This can be used in the internal work one does toward managing mood disorders, the knowlege that the feelings are not engendered by situation but by disordered brain chemistry. Sometimes that knowlege helps in conunction with medication. Also, sometimes cognititve behavioral therapy can be a huge help and reduce the medication  to an adjunctive role.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

Some of the research that I have done says that with this type of meds, your liver will not metabolize other meds such as ibuprofen.  If thats the case, wouldnt it seem reasonable to think your liver wouldnt metabolize alcohol normally causeing higher concentraions in your blood than normal.  And if that being the case, then breath tests would be abnormal.  Whaat does your experience suggest?\n\n",

    "title": "Hyperthyroid and tachycardia",
    "content": "Hi,      I am a 28yr old female, diagnosed recently in October of 2008, with a hyperthyroid.  I have no family history and have been always very healthy.  In 2007, I made a big move and also decided to go back to school for Pre-Med.  I currently work as a Medical Assistant, am married and have two children(ages 11 and 3). I figured all the stress that involves a move, going back to school and family life were the cause of my symptoms.  I realized I was losing weight easily, my heart rate was reaching 147 and I started feeling very dizzy constantly. Had an EKG done which showed SVT's.      In October my hyperthyroid was confirmed and was immediately placed on PTU and Propanolol.  Very quickly the symptoms faded and started feeling better.  I was not the best patient and many times would forget to take the meds.  I would remember to take them when my symptoms would return.  Around February of 2009, I repeated my TSH, T4, T3 and free T4, all showed normal but still having the tachycardia.  My Doc took me off the PTU and kept me on the Propanolol 40mg daily.  My heart rate has never returned to it's normal rate between 70 and 80.  Now it's constantly in the 90's after medication and around 114 before the Propanolol.  My question is, could my heart pace have changed and stayed quicker after the hyperthyroid or can my thyroid still be causing the tachycardia even though it shows normal levels?   Sheshy\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hyperthyroid and tachycardia",
    "content": "Hello --  There are two considerations here. First, per your last question, yes, sometimes after hypothyroidism has been diagnosed and manged the heart rate can still remain somewhat elevated, although yours is presently hovering the high end of normal. It is not normal for you, however, and the use of plain propranolol once daily is an odd choice for a number of reasons, which is the second consideration,  since this could actually be contributing to the problem now.   Propranolol plain has a dosing interval of six hours. It also is the oldest of all the beta blockers (42 years on the market now) and many newer ones have been developed that are long-acting (ther is even a long acting propranolol, but there are still many others better suited to smooth control of inappropriate tachycardia). Because you're only taking one of these  per day, you don't achieve a consistent blood level of the drug, so your heart rate will naturally slow some (but obviously not a lot) at the beginning of the dosing cycle, then as the drug clears your system your rate, already accelerated, becomes even faster. While this helps a little, it's far from ideal. Something like metaprolol succinate, which is a once a day drug with a roughly 24 hour half-life and far fewer potential annoying side effects than propranolol, would seem a far better choice, starting probably at 50 mg. daily. As it stands now you're almost guaranteed to have a slight slowing of your rate followed by a slow increase, just as you've described.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

And, I remember thinking that once my levels were \"normal\" I would feel so much better.  Well, it's not true! A great book to read is The Thyroid Diet by Mary J. Shomon.  It explains so much.  I do cardio 5-6 days a week and lift 2-3x a week AND eat great during the week.  My problem is weekends.  I eat whatever on the weekends.  I used to be ok with that.  Not anymore!!!  I have horrible problems with joint/muscle pains still as well.  The book mentions trying fish oil for joint pain, mood, and possible help with weight loss.  It also talks about many other supplements.  It's definitely worth the read.  I got mine from Amazon for only $7.  Another book I purchased and just started to read is \"Your Hidden Food Allergies Are Making You Fat\" by Roger Deutsch and Rudy Rivera M.D.  It talks about food sensitivities; not necessarily allergies.    Good luck, hope you find what works for you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Normal TSH Fatigue, Joint Pain",
    "content": "Hello --  While your TSH was normal there can be some misleading findings in certain types of hypothyroidism, depending on the cause. Since there is a history in your family that's pretty extensive, you may not have the usual thyroiditis, and TSH may not adequately diagnose thyroid failure. Your symptoms are all, as you already know, completely consistent with hypothyroidism, and given that and your family history I strongly suspect some variant form of thyroid failure. I also agree an increase in dietary restriction and exercise is unlikely to change things much, since there is some sort of ongoing underlying process most likely causing all this. It may even be upstream of the thyroid itself, since heritable thyroid problems tend to often often originate higher in the endocrine system. For this reason I think it would  be very beneficial for you to arrange a consult with an endocrinologist. If this  leads to uncovering the source of the problem, great. If not, at least the specialist will have some insight  into what paths ought to be explored instead of just suggesting you improve on your healthy lifestyle.   I hope this is helpful.  Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

Lost 5 lbs last August on WW.  I am retaining water as well.  My doctor tested me for thyroid issues and then just said that was all she could think of.  I know my diet is a good one - about 1200 cals a day, low fat - lots of fruit, whole grain (brown rice, etc), snacks are nuts, dark chocolate etc.  I have not lost one pound since starting my diet 3 months ago.  I have also done a 2 week colon cleanse (nothing crazy just a slow natural one) and tried 2 weeks of water pills (Ok'd by my doc).  Nothing....  I'm very concerned that something is wrong with me - glucose normal, a little high, other blood tests OK except a slightly elevated bilrubin which doc said is OK.  What type of doctor or test should I be asking for?  Someone recommended an abdominal scan - perhaps liver/kidney issues?  My stomach is very bloated, usually not like this.  No real digestion issues - bowel movements normal, regular.  I really feel that something is going on and don't want to just be told to keep dieting, etc. I want to rule out any other issues.  I would so appreciate any assistance - ideas - etc.  Thank you!\n\n",

It's not really a diet book, although it has a diet idea at the end.  It explains a lot of the issues thyroid patients deal with.  She also goes over other reasons for lack of weight loss/weight gain, and she also covers supplements in detail.  I bought it from Amazon.com for $7.  I also purchased another book \"Your Hidden Food Allergies Are Making You Fat.\"  VERY interesting.  I am going to talk to my doctor about ALCAT testing since reading some of this book.  Good luck....it's not easy and even doctors don't even seem to understand.  Switch doctors until you find one that will listen and be willing to run tests, etc.  Be your own advocate!\n\n",

My next question is, could there be any other organs, tissue, etc that could have calcium buildup from the local term hypercalcemia due to the hyperparathyroidism.  I found a website exlaining Metastatic Calcinosis and it talks about hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidsim as a potential cause (see link, http://www.healthscout.com/ency/1/666/main.html).  What tests could answer this question?  Thx!\n\n",

    "title": "33yo f, no menstruation, low estradiol/FSH, on birth control",
    "content": "Hello,  I am a 33yo female, generally healthy with no real health problems.  My menstruation started at around age 13, and I began taking oral contraceptives at age 21.  My cycles have always been very normal (both before and during the contraceptive use).  My current pill (which I have used for I think about 10 years) is Levora (0.15 mg levonorgestrel & 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol).  Almost two years ago I stopped getting periods.  After the second missed period, I went to my primary doctor to make sure I wasn't pregnant and that nothing else was going on.  They told me it was probably just stress-related, etc., and not to worry unless I didn't have periods for 6 months.  Well, it has lasted much longer than that, almost two years now.  I finally followed up with my new primary doctor a few months ago.  He seemed concerned that I had about 18 months with no periods, and sent me for bloodwork.  When that came back, he was concerned that both estradiol and FSH were low:  Estradiol <10 pg/mL (normal range 19-529; no alternative range provided for oral contraceptives) FSH 3.9 MIU/mL (normal range for oral contraceptives: 0 - 3.5, and without contraceptives 2.5 - 33.4, so this one actualyl doesn't seem bad... but he said it should be high given the low estradiol levels)  So he sent me to have my prolactin tested, which came up normal:  Prolactin 12.3 ng/mL (normal range 2.8 - 29.9).  He sent me for a pelvic ultrasound, which was normal.  Pap smear was also normal.  Then he referred me to an endocrinologist.  I saw the endocrinologist today and, while he seemed interested and empathetic, he didn't seem concerned about these hormone levels at all.  He said that taking oral contraceptives for years can cause your body to stop producing its own estrogen, which may be why my levels show up so low.  But he did not really have an explanation for my lack of periods.  I do have some increased hair growth on my chin only, which seems to have been progressively getting worse over the last several years.  I also seem to be having more issues with acne, sometimes waking up with almost a rash-like breakout across my entire forehead (which I first noticed about 2 years ago).  My sex drive has also been virtually non-existent for a couple of years.  In my non-medical opinion, something is definitely odd about my hormonal levels.  My question is, was my primary doctor right to be concerned about the low levels of both estradiol and FSH (even though FSH was technically normal, he thought it should be higher in the presence of such low estradiol levels)?  Or was the endocrinologist right to say that these levels are normal for someone on birth control pills?  Either way, isn't it odd that i don't get periods at age 33 (really starting at age 31)?  My mother got regular periods up through menopause in her early 60s.  My only other health quirks, which I mention only on the off chance there is some connection: - I've had inexplicable pain in my left rib cage (near my left armpit) off and on for 14 years.  When it's bad, it's really bad, like I can barely catch my breath and pain radiates up into my neck.  It feels like a nerve is being pinched or sort of like torn cartilage (which I've had in my knee so I know how that feels).  I've had several tests for this over the years and always been told the generic \"well it's probably costochondritis and we don't know a cause or cure for that\", but I'm not sure I buy that, particularly because it does not respond to anti-inflammatories and there is a clear \"flaring\" nature to it, where it will be fine for weeks or months and then excruciatingly bad for about a week. - I get rash-like bumps on my hands a few times a year which I finally deduced are related to sun exposure (after ruling out contact with plants since I get them no matter my locale - i.e., Maine, California, Russia, etc.).  Sometimes they can be a full-blown rash covering the entire backs of my hands.  They only last a few days.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  I am not interested in having children, so my fertility is not really my main concern.  I just want to know what is wrong.  Should I be concerned?  What exactly would be the phenomenon that would cause my periods to stop due to taking the pill?  If my body does not have estrogen, could my bone density be a concern?  Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "I was hoping you could share your expertise. I'm almost 30y female, I'm not overtly shy, I don't have problems talking to strangers or going out with friends, but I hate being singled out for anything. I would blush occasionally, but nothing excessive or abnormal. There's one or two people I'd almost always blush when talking to, but I figured it's more my fear that I'm going to blush that triggers the actual blush.   Several years ago I went through a period of excessive blushing at just about anything. I didn't have to be uncomfortable, just people looking at me would trigger it. I shortly after changed my birth control pill and I went back to what it used to be, annoying but manageable. A short while later I was diagnosed with PCOS.   I've been on the same meds since 2004 (BCP and Spironolactone) but lately I seem to blush about everything, several times a day. My boss can't say a word to me without my face going bright red. It's incredibly embarrassing. And the more I fear it the more it happens I'm aware of this, but I wonder if the hormones can cause it?  I also notice that I sweat more than I used to and I'm very sensitive (ie headache) to weather changes, which is also new. I've had my blood work done recently and everything is apparently normal. Can it be the hormones? Is something wrong somewhere or is it a purely mental thing of fear of blushing making it worse? I don't know if I should see a gp/endocrinologist or a psychiatrist.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: PCOS: hormonal imbalace cause of excessive blushing?",
    "content": "Hello --  While I am somewhat out of my element with this quesion I find it so interesting I thought I'd give you my thoughts first, then perhaps refer it to someone here who may have more insight into the possible hormone imbalance potential, which it would seem to me probably plays at least a part, maybe a substantial one.  While hormones out of balance can certainly account for this sort of thing, anxety always will complicate anything it touches, as since blushing is associated with social awkwardness (and I don't mean to say you're socially awkward, only that you may suddenly be feelng that way because of the unusual blushing) the thing can become more or less self-perpetuating, as witl all anxiety-influenced problems.   Then again, it may be something impossible to control, because completely physical. So while you might try working it through in your mind, and while I doubt a psychiatrist is in order, an endocrinologist or perhaps just a gynecologist could throw more light on this. With that in mind I'm going to refer your question to both those teams here and see if anyone comes up with anything more concrete for you. Check back here in a day or two and hopefully someone with more insight into this will have advanced more useful theories and info.  Good luck to you with this. Hope to hear back from you soon.\n\n",

I was away for a week on a short trip with my little sister who I don't get to see very often, but who I talk to regularly. I blushed even a couple of times just talking to her. She's family, we know each other very well and it wasn't an awkward conversation. I'm also fair skinned, so every bit of color shows up very easily.  I've have seen a gp, who told me it's all in my head basically, but after much talking agreed to refer me to a gynecologist. Unfortunately the endocrinologist I used to see is on a extended mat leave and not planning to return to work any time soon. If anyone else on this board has any insight I'd greatly appreciate it!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   I was diagnosed with Graves disease 16 years ago and it quickly went into remission.  About 2 years ago, I was told I was hypothyroid and was put on synthroid.  About a year ago, I had a sudden onset of weird symptoms such as beesting feeling/tingling in feet and hands which also moved to face, yeast infections, cognitive issues, vertigo, sweatty palms, migraine, menstrual changes, bone spurs, multiple crowns in that same time period, plus many more.  I also developed what I was told is Lichen Planus.  I was sent to a neurologist after I blacked out in the shower and went to the ER.  All tests came back negative for MS, etc.  He found that I had multinodular goiter and sent me to see an Endoncrinologist.  He said it was the graves and adjusted my synthroid.  I had my follow-up appt. and these were the results:   Ultrasound showed one nodule changed from hpercholic to hypoechoic, but no substantial growth.  Anti thyroglobulin AB H  372.0 (ref. range <10)  Anti thyroid microsomal AB H 1790.7 (ref. range <5.0)...result was rechecked  Free T3  2.7 (ref range 1.98 to 4.6)  Thyroglobulin L 0.2 (ref range 0.8 to 49)  Vitamin D 25 Hydroxy L 14.7 (ref. range 31-80)   I am told this means I have active antibodies for both Graves and Hashimotos....is this possible to have both?  I have been having adrenaline rushes with tingling, and heart palpitations, emotional swings, etc.  I cannot seem to lose weight and I eat right and exercise daily.  I do cardio 5x a week and lift 3x a week.  If I opted to get the thyroid removed, is it true that the immune system can then attack another organ, or would I be better off removing it?  My Endocrinologist swears these symptoms are not because of the thyroid because the levels are controlled by the synthroid....which he also stated about the weird nuerological symptoms that flooded in last year as well......???   Thanks in advance for your time!\n\n",

    "content": "My health has been declinging for years, and no one can find the cause.  I have wildly fluctuating blood pressure (at my last Dr appointment he 'caught' the swings, when I got there it was 120/70, soon after I started flushing and sweating and he checked again, 190/100 (L arm) and 189/110 (R arm) and within 15 minutes was back to 120/60), sinus and tentricular tachycardia, flushing, sweating, flank pain and nausea.  I cannot tolerate the heat at all, am losing weight (55 pounds in last year) and a single sip of anything alcoholic causes a flair.  I was tested for pheochromocytoma in 2007, everything was normal but the mets in the 24 hour urine (819 with a ref range of 320-600) and was told it was not that.  I have also tested and been cleared for cushings, carcinoid, anything autoimmune (except Hashimoto's Thyroiditis which was diagnosed in 2007).  After my recent Dr appointment he put me in the hospital, and they sent me home within 22 hours with another 24 hour urine hold for pheo.  I have severe allergies to all MRI and CT contrast dyes, so they have only done a CT w/o contrast on my abdomen and found only calcifications  in my spleen they decided as healed splenic granulomas.  I have also been told that I produce too much gastrin, causing the peptic ulcers, GERD and esophageal stricture.  All I know us that some days I am able to wash my hair and shower, even walk a little... other days I have to take breaks just brushing my teeth to get my breath back and my heart rate back down.

    "title": "Re: Pheochromocytoma, Carcinoid and thyroid",
    "content": "Hello --  There are several possibilities that jump out here, including of course pheochromocytoma. Also Graves' disease, for which you have a family history. Since pheo can cause the sudden, extreme BP spikes with return to normal levels, both it and hyperthyroidism can cause heat intolerance. All the other symptoms are rather similar, but with pheo more often than not patients wind up winded because of sustained high heart rate. However (again) there is such a phenomenon, with Graves' disease, as \"high output heart failure\", which causes very similar symptoms and the shortness of breath, intermittently, that you describe. I'm assuming because of your history and symptoms that you've been worked up for hyperthyroid, but this needs to be explored very thoroughly along with pheo. You have quite a family history of genetic, mostly autoimmune diseases, so a metabolic problem of some sort is not out of the question and your cortisol levels need to be double checked as well. Somewhere in this mix of metabolic disorders your problem probably lies and it will take a really sharp endocrinologist to pin this down, but it can be done.   I hope this is helpful at least. It's difficult, at a remove, and with  your potpourri of family traits, to make a more concrete guess, but at least this may help guide the exploration of these various possibilites. Please follow up with us here as needed and keep us updated as to new findings also. Good luck to  you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your reply,  My 24 hour pheochromocytoma test results are back, but they refuse to discuss them over the phone and say there is alot to go over, it will be about a week before I am able to go in to hear the results.  I did have one thing that I had forgotten to mention.  Due to the neuropathy I have in both hands (luckily or not, mine is weakness and almost complete loss of sensation to my fingers and not the kind that causes pain) I shaved only when absolutely necessary.  I have not had to shave under my arms at all for a few years now because no hair grows there anymore and hair elsewhere has thinned or completely gone away as well.  My legs have only a few patches where hair still grows, my eye lashes have thinned considerably as well as my eyebrows but I still have a full head of hair even though I shed it constantly.  When I checked online, it showed Addison's Disease is associated with that, but with my blood pressure and heart rate issues being high (though fluctuating uncontrollably with extreme fluctuations in minutes) I have my doubts that is the issue.  My thyroid is low (Hashimoto's Thyroiditis) and that might have something to do with it.  I was wondering, is it even possible for MEN 1 to be involved with pheochromocytoma and Addison's?  It would certainly explain why my blood pressure is so completely out of whack if I have two tumors that cause equally severe yet opposite cardiovascular reactions as well as the severe gastric issues, hair loss and perhaps even why I might have unexplained neuropathies.  Sometimes I feel that even if we are looking for the zebra in the horses we need to check closer because it might just end up being a zedonk or a zorse... a hybred that should not be there but is there none the less.  Should I even bring the idea up to my Dr or should I just hold off and see what happens?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi-  I can't get an answer on my test results from my physician office for a month since they can't fit me in and are unwilling to \"put me at ease\" during this time.  I am hypothryroid since age 7.  Was on Amour Thyroid due to high antibody levels, but my new endo put me back on Brand name Synthroid 150mcg.  Thyroid is now testing in normal range.  I have never felt worse.  Have diagnosis of PCOS with Metabolic Syndrome in 1990. On Actos for insulin resistance.  Cannot take metformin due to intolerance of the med and prior surgery.   On Liptor and Lozvana for cholestrol-levels in normal range. I have a Mirena IUD. Had recent blood work done and my cortisol level was 13.0 ug/dl in range of 3.1-22.4.  DHEA was 1045 ng/dl with range of 112-722 as normal.  Also LH was 5.8 mIu/ml and FSH was 5.4 MIu/ml. Estradiol was 72 pg/ml  with range of 19-528.  Progestrone 0.2 ng/ml,  Testosterone, Serum 37 ng./dl with normal 14-76, Free Testosterone (Direct)<0.2 pg/ml, 0.0-2.2 normal range.  Prolactin 7.4  with 2.8-29.2 normal range. Last fasting blood sugar was 81.  It appears the only test that is high is the DHEA being 1045 ng/dl with 112-722 as normal.  I am suffering from extreme fatigue (sleeping at least 12-14 hours a day), hirtuism, severe acne, weight gain depsite being on a 1500 calorie balance diet for the last 4 months and thyroid being stable for at least the last 3 months, oily skin and hair loss, no menstrual cycle, depression, past infertility with only one live healthy birth of 5 pregnancies.  I also have 3 grandparents that are of Yugoslavian decent.  Since LH and FSH are close to a  1:1 ratio, could this indicate Non classic cogenital adrenal hyperplasia and PCOS being a symptom of the disorder or is this possible something else?\n\n",

My doctor gave me a progesterone induced period in Jan '09 and I had a period for three days and then I have again not had one since. I suffer from night sweats so bad that I have showered at 3am. I also seem to be void of all energy and my cognitive ability is lacking. All lab work including my thyroid, FSH, LH, iron and Pituitary have all came back normal. My MRI showed no brain tumor. However, my Estradiol levels recently came back at 10. I'm not sure if my doctor checked my Estrone levels. Could this mean I am hitting early menopause? Or is this due to my YAZ and is normal? My family doctor does not seem very knowledgeable about this. We are both at a loss trying to figure out why I am not sleeping, sweating, and my hormones seem to be out of whack.

    "content": "Hi  there --  While YAZ could be impicated in this, basically it does sound like early menopause, which is not a well-recognized side-effect of YAZ, but indirectly certainly could be a cause or partial cause of ovarian failure and inappropriate menopause. A consult with an OB-GYN specialist, with possible referral to an endocrinologist would be entirely appropriate. While it's no longer unusual for GPs and some internists to be less knowlegeable in OB-GYN and endo areas (the \"age of specialization\" seems to be burning out, however) your doctor should at least be willing and able to acknowlege any shortcomings in this area and at least fill out a referral sheet, which is what is called for now.   I wouldn't discontinue either the YAZ or Topamax as yet, but do suspect the YAZ may be playing a role in this. I hope this is helpful and please follow up with us here as needed. Also keep us updated. Good luck to you.\n\n",

I burn 4-5,000 calories exercising a week plus watch my diet and I continue to gain. This is on top of the insomnia, night sweats, increase in cholesterol, and lack of energy.

My mother thinks it is congestive heart failure and neither she nor her doctors have so far looked into hyperparathyroidism as the routine blood tests came back within normal range. However I understand that some 7-12% of HPT cases never show significantly elevated blood calcium or HPT rates but that these are therefore difficult to diagnose.  Are we right in saying the CHF she now suffers is likely to be result of untreated HPT given these symptoms and how can we make people investigate HPT?  fayme\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Fayme --  This is a difficult question you pose, because hypoparathyroidism is a real problem in older patients (although based on your age I'd be surprised if your mother is in the range where this is usually seen). Hypoparathyroidism is a big problem in the geriatric range largely because it is often difficult to diagnose, but sometimes the team needs to apply reason and observe cause-and-effect even when the laboratory doesn't necessarily support the suspicion. The components are mostly there, including CHF, which eventually tends to show up in these cases anyway. I would very much like to see if your mother's doctors would be willing to take a look at her cervical spine for signs of degeneration there, because this is often seen with hypoparathydoidism (due to osteoporosis) and can cause some of the more severe symptoms later on. It  won't prove that's what's going on, but it would certainly add to the preponderance of evidence.  That being said, there's no real way to support your conclusion that CHF is being caused by hypoparathyroidism, since there is no clinical evidence for it, and CHF is also common on its own in geriatric patients. Also, there's no good way to \"make\" doctors follow your instincts, even if those instincts happen to seem pretty on target. This is one of those areas of medicine which remains cloudy  because the doctor is, after all, the doctor, and isn't going to readily allow himself to be directed by the patient, although some will certainly be more open to suggestions than others. You can hope this may be the case, but you can't \"make\" anyone look where you'd like them to look. There is always, of course,  the option of second opinions, consults, etc.  I hope this is helfpful to you, and just for the record, I'd personally pursue the possibility via whatever route presents itself, to rule out (or in) hypoparathyroidism. Good luck to you with this. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Lethargy, Acne, Eczema, Hirsute \u2013 Endocrine Problem?",
    "content": "Recently I have started to suspect that the following symptoms are not separate but caused by an endocrine problem of some sort, after searching the internet I highly suspect low estrogen levels (sorry in advance for the long post):  I am a 21 year old female, in the past I have been treated separately for  Moderate Acne \u2013 Started at age 16, at the age of 21 there has been little improvement despite many topical creams, minomycin and Diane ED 35 (non of which I am still using)  Eczema \u2013 I first saw a dermatologist at age 15 about this, no matter what I do my skin is painfully dry, patchy, itchy. Again many topical creams prescribed, non really help.  Unexplained extreme joint pain \u2013 Diagnosed as \u201cReactive Arthritis\u201d, it is persistent 24 hours a day, disruptive and distressing.  Eye problems \u2013 I have been diagnosed with Karatoconus and use Patanol eye drops for very itchy, very dry eyes  Dandruff \u2013 have tried many medicated shampoos, it never really goes away. My hair is very dry and brittle.  Additionally I have not seen a  doctor about the below symptoms as they almost seem silly, and I\u2019m starting to feel like a hypochondriac :  I am constantly lethargic - even when I have had a solid nights sleep I need naps to get through the day. I\u2019m not a lazy person, but seem to have no energy to do what I want to.  Very bad memory \u2013 this seems to be getting worse, I am very foggy minded, so much so that many people I know have commented on my inability to focus or remember simple things. This is very frustrating and hard to explain.  Very irregular periods \u2013 They started when I was 15, I can go many, many months without having a period, the only time in my life they were constant was when I was on Diane but I stopped Diane after on two occasions having  periods that lasted for over 3 weeks each.  Weak fingernails \u2013 I have to keep them very short   Very insensitive to the cold \u2013 It\u2019s starting to make me insecure as even strangers comment on me wearing thick clothes in supposedly warm weather.  Masculine characteristics \u2013 I am very hairy in areas associated with male body hair patterns and build muscle really easily. I have undeveloped breasts, my nipples are small and have no sensitivity.  Poor skin quality \u2013 aside from the eczema and the acne my skin feels very weak, and has very poor elasticity, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related but even though I am very skinny and build muscle easily I have VERY bad cellulite, even on my arms and calves where there is hardly any fat at all, my skin looks like that of a much older woman, not healthy, just dimply, saggy and old!  Cold sores \u2013 again unsure if it is related but I get bad cold sore episodes quite frequently.  These things might seem superficial but they are really taking their toll on my day to day life, I often feel very depressed and don\u2019t know if these problems are causing my depression as I have no other reason to be so.  I did try speaking to my General Practitioner, but he was more concerned with treating the visible symptoms like my acne, without thinking about the cause. He told me that Hormone tests are a waste of time as they are unreliable and I should just try another topical cream for my acne (one I have already tried) \u201cuntil your hormones settle down, your 21 so it should be soon\u201d.  He doesn\u2019t take this seriously and it is making me feel like I complain too much, even though I know something is not right.  Should I insist on seeing an endocrinologist? Or would I be wasting their time as they might have bigger problems to diagnose? What would I even ask an endocrinologist?  What might be the cause? Am I right to think these are symptoms from a single cause? What else should I look for to determine this?  What might be wrong with me, is anything wrong with me? What should my next step be? I just want my body to do what it needs to do, without hassle or concern.  Thank you for your time and consideration.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Last things first: I would most definitely insist on referral (or self-referral) to an endocrinologist, since pretty much everything you describe suggests a pituitary problem, which of course includes a goodly number of possible variations on that theme. If all this can be traced to the pituitary, however, much progress will have been made, and your doctor's statement that hormone tests are \"a waste of time\" and \"unreliable\" is pretty astounding. You might want to consider a change of GP unless you've had a long and otherwise satisfactory relationship. This doesn't bode well for your overall healthcare in the future. But meanwhile, yes, see an endo specialist or, at the very least, a highly competent internist. I would bet money on there being a pituitary malfunction, and if so the only remaining challenge would be to determine which sort and how to manage it. There are other potential endocrinological causes of your symptoms,  but what is almost certain is that they will fall under this heading.   I hope this  is helpful. While I can get to that point fairly easily, after that the possibilities are too numerous to hazard a guess. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While it's understandable that your doctor may be perplexed over this, that's no reason for the ball to be dropped at his office. Someone needs to follow this up, since if the thyroid panel results are correct it then goes back, very likely, to a pituitary problem -- and not necessarily a tumor although that is one possibility. An endocrinologist (if that's not what your doctor of record is) should be consulted at once, and perhaps this could get the MRI bumped up,as well as other appropriate tests done also. There's probably a very sound reason for all this, and it may well be readily medically manageable. Endocrinology is the consult needed, and if your doctor is an endo specialist then it's time for a change of doctor.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed.

    "title": "Re: RAI safe for Graves after SAH?",
    "content": "Hi there --  While I can think of (and find) no correlation between RAI and cardiac complications linked with past CVA, there are of course some other contraindications in some patients for RAI vs. alternative treatments including surgery and beta blocker therapy. Also, to answer your other questions, yes, at least indirectly, the functioning of the pituitary can be affected adversely buy SAH, although it is a small subset of patients who have this happen and it's not necessarily due to a direct injury to the gland. Still, yes, it can be compromised in the discharge of some of its hormones.   To the other question,  Hashimotos and Graves' are sometimes seen simultaneously, which in understandably confusing to both patients and clinicians. It is sometimes a transient situation, but it's far from unheard-of.   I hope your doctor and you together will weigh the various options for treating Graves' disease, and feel it probably may as well be treated (kind of a moot issue, really, since with Hashimoto's the thyroid will eventually likley become inactive anyway, so there's no big risk of loss there) and that even though I  know of no cardiovascular complications  re: previous CVA, there are other reasons to look  at the options available.   I hope this answers your questions. Please feel free to follow up with us here as needed and please also keep us updated. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 38years old with NO symptoms of thyroditis.  I went to my gynecologist and he ask me to have a sonogram to check a nodule in my thyroid and there are 3 nodules (big) on the right and one on the left lobe.  The biopsy says that I have on the left chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (smears with numerous lymphocyted in different stages of maturation, lymphoid aggregates and groups of follicular cells, and some Hurthle celll metaplasia) and on the right hyperplastic adenomatoid nodule with cystic degeneration (abundant watery colloid, numerous foamy histiocytes, and groups and monolayered sheets of unremarkable follicular cells.) both of them negative for malignancy.  All my blood tests (T3,T4,T7, TSH, Thyroglobulin AB etc.) are all in normal range.  The doctor has recommended me a thyroidectomy due to the size of the nodules and because the hurthle cells are considered pre-malignant.  I am not sure that I should remove the thyroid if it is working well according to the blood work, there is no malignancy, and I have no symptoms that are bothering me.  What do you recommend?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  This is a difficult question because the apparent answer would be if it's working, why fix it? The answer is the fact that statistically the pre-malignancy rate for the type of neoplasms found is pretty high, and because of the nature and location it is unwise as a rule to leave them alone til they start to show signs of malignant change, because by then there's no guarantee the \"seeding\" of them won't already have begun. This is why this is a very common reason for thyroidectomy, and just from my personal perspective, this is what I would want for a loved one or would do for myself. Sooner or later the thing is almost certain to become malignant, and by then the  whole process becomes a lot more complex.   I hope this answers your question.

    "content": "Hi, I'm James   Let me start by telling you how I feel.  I have felt terrible for the past three months solid. I am 23, I have bad palpitations and my heat races extremely fast. However these symptoms only occur when I try to exert myself. I'm fine during rest. I also have bad dizziness(sitting or standing) and have lost over 10lbs. I startle very easily, and I am intolerant of heat. Often times I have difficulty swallowing and breathing as well as sound hypersensitivity. High pitch noises drive me nuts now. These are my worst symptoms.  I have been having them since february and have seen doctors for heart, ears and regular family doctors. I had a stress test and doc said that my heart did excellerate too fast, but there were no arrythmias, so he didn't really care that I can't do anything without my heart flying and beating out of my chest. All my tests keep coming back negative and my last dr. checked my thyroid and said he felt no nodules and then the bloodtest came back normal. I was for sure I had a thyroid problem, even though I'm a man, because of all the symptoms and my mom, grandmother had hyperthyroidism.  So I guess my question is, could it be thyroid related even though the test came back negative? My last dr. said he would redo the test, but he didn't know where to go from there if it was negative. Me either! The only thing I could think of was that I had a very hard fall playing basketball and landed on my right side and back area near my kidney about a week and a half before my symptoms started. I don't know if that could be a factor because I don't know what I could have damaged then (Adrenal gland?). Thanks in advance for any help. I appreciate it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  There's a sometimes fine line between the symptoms of hyperthyroid and pheochromocytoma (adrenal tumor). Because you mention the fall on your flank it is conceivable there was some trauma to one of the adrenals which may now have given rise to a tumor there. Because of this and the similarity of presentation of the two diseases, it is important that not only the thyroid panel be repeated, but that you have both serum test and 24-hour urine test to help rule out/in pheochromocytoma as well.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed and also keep us updated as to anything new that comes up. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  The thyroid replacement meds could possibly cause some increase in catecholemines, though I wouldn't think it would normally be enough to show a significant increase in adrenal hormone in the urine. \"Significant\" is the operative word here, and this may be why the repeat test has been ordered. Normally the main way this happens is as you say, due to pheochromocytoma, adrenal tumors. However, it is possible the thyroid replacement has caused a measurable increase above normal without being truly significant (diagnostic) of pheochromocytoma, and I'm not sure this would disqualify you for the gastric bypass anyway, but the test should be repeated, along with blood work for serum thyroxine levels to see if there is a related increase in both.

    "content": "Hello --  While there's nothing in the literature (or my experience) to suggest Akineton might cause damage to the endorphine-producing mechanism, it may well depress this as well as other things, on a temporary basis. It may also be that changing/discontinuing the drug has thrown off your perception of well being, and this may or may not be a transient effect of withdrawal from the drug. Since you say you've been off it \"for some time\" I'm suspecting this is more an essential problem than anything caused by the drug. I'd discuss this with the psychiatrist and look into other possible causes and/or meanings of this strange development. Meanwhile continue to exercise and perhaps eventually the experience will begin to once again feel as it should.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

I've done research and seen that a prolonged QTc and pulmonary hypertension can be related to hyperthyroidism and asked him to order labs.  I got my labs back and my FT4 was 1.8 (Lab normal is .8-1.6) and my TSH was 1.590 (.4-4.5).  I know that diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is usually involves low TSH values, but mine seem to be normal, but I can't seem to find a reason that my FT4 was high.  The cardiologist seemed to think it wasn't a big deal and still can't find a reason that I would have pulmonary hypertension.  I'm in decent shape (>1300kcal/week cardio).  I have had heat and light sensitivity since I was very young.  I'm susceptible to heat exhaustion.  My heart rate is usually in the 80's, and I tend to have higher blood pressure, but it is normal sometimes. I'm also dyslexic.

    "content": "Hi there --  The conncections between hyperthyroid and both long Q-T and pumonary hypertension (or cor pulomale -- CP) are tenuous at best. And while your Free T4 was outside the high end of normal, it was only a very slight evevation. This should be repeated, perhaps more than once, to determine just what's going on if anything, but it is likely a trivial finding as your cardiologist has said. Still, it is only reasonable to be sure of that.   On the other hand long Q-T and CP are not trivial findings and warrant close followup and possible medical therapy as well. I trust the doctor is doing this.   I don't think you likely have a hyper thyroid condtion, but only followup tests can make this certain. Even if you do, again, the connection between profound hyperthyroid and the other conditions is tenuous. What your test showed would not account for either and, again, these do need to be closely followed.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

A study done by U  GUNTEKIN, M.D et. al. showed that out of 16 people with hyperthyroidism and long QT, 10 of them no longer had pulmonary hypertension or a long QTc after treatment.  Also, I don't understand why it would matter if my TSH is normal or not.  2% or hyperthyroid cases don't have an subnormal TSH, and it has to do with the hypothalamus being insensitive to T3 or another cause that I don't remember.  My wife who has been diagnosed hyperthyroid, had the exact same T4 value before treatment, and since T4 and T3 are what cause a person's metabolic rate to increase, not TSH, I don't understand why having a normal TSH would even matter.\n\n",

    "content": "Excess hair ina female is known as hirsutism. It has been traditional to divide patients with hirsutism into those with no elevation of serum androgen levels and no other clinical features (usually labelled 'idiopathic hirsutism') and those with an identifiable endocrine imbalance (most commonly polycystic ovary sydnrome (PCOS) or rarely other causes).  Famialial or idiopathic hirsutism does occur, but usually involves a distribution of hair growth which is not typically androgenic.  Similarly, non-androgen-dependant hair growth occurs with drugs such as phenytoin, diazoxide, minoxidil and cyclosporin.  Iatrogenic hirsutism also occurs after treatment with androgens, or more weakly androgenic drugs such as progestagens or danazol.  Rarer, and more serious, endocrine causes of hirsutism and virilization include congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome and virilization tumours of the ovary and adrenal.  All these should be considered in any patients with hirsutism.  Shaving is best for legs, arms or facial hair. However, this hair removal method can cause ingrown hairs in the pubic region. Plucking is the most painful method, but may be the most worthwhile when there are just a few hairs you want to remove. Be cautious when selecting hair removal creams over-the-counter: All creams are not the same. For instance, a hair removal cream designated for pubic hair should not be used to remove facial hair. The chemicals in these products dissolve the hair shaft and drawbacks can be significant. The chemicals can also cause superficial burns. If you have a history of allergic reactions, you may want to seek the advice of your doctor before trying any hair removal creams. There is a topical cream called Vaniqa, recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the slowing of facial hair growth in women. This cream slows growth, but will not remove the hair.   Hot waxing: You can do this at home or you can also have it performed by a professional in a salon. Hot waxing can be messy and may leave some hairs behind because they can break off. Infection is one side effect to watch for. Still, many women use this hair removal method in the bikini area and for hair on the upper lip.   Laser removal: This is one of the longest-lasting methods and generally requires 3-4 or more treatment sessions, but it is not for everyone: your hair must be dark in color.   Laser hair removal The laser beam or a light pulse works to destroy the hair bulb itself. The treatment can be expensive and sometimes painful. Be sure to select a doctor or technician who is highly trained and knowledgeable. You may require multiple sessions, but it can be used on many parts of the body where unwanted hair may appear.   There are two primary hair removal methods of electrolysis: galvanic and thermolytic.   Galvanic. Chemically destroys hair follicle. It is the oldest method used, but requires several treatments.  Thermolytic. Uses heat to destroy the hair follicle.  In either case, be sure to find a professional who is highly trained and knowledgeable with this hair removal method. Electrolysis can be used on all parts of the body to remove unwanted hair.   If none of these hair removal methods seem to address your particular problems, ask your doctor about oral medications to inhibit hair growth.\n\n",

    "content": "I've been 100 lbs my whole life, could eat anything I wanted without gaining weight and lots of energy. In 2004 I started gaining weight rapidly, loss of appetite, lethargy, insomnia, severe depression, weakened finger nails, new skin problems, the list goes on. I was finally diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.  I also have a multi-nodular goiter on the right lobe of my thyroid plus a cyst. I started thyroxine in Sept. 2007 and quickly went from .25 mcg to 125 mcg per day. I'm still suffering from the weight problems (got down to 74 kilos but have gained at least 10 kilos back, had been 230 lbs) and most of the other problems are still persisting. I pass out after eating about half the time and suffer from worsening memory loss (things I know that I know are hard to remember)   On top of everything, my last blood tests show low RDW, low Lymphocytes, high ESR, elevated CEA, TSH level at <0.003, T3 & T4 are within normal limits. I've had an MRI without/with contrast to check for pituitary tumour,there's nothing there. I'm in an area in Malaysia at the moment that has no endocrinologists and the doctors I am seeing here can only go so far with the help they can provide. Any information you can give regarding what I might need to watch for or do until I can get to an endocrinologist would be very helpfull Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While I believe, based on your history, that you have a connective tissue disease, some autoimmune process that may be causing a lot of different issues and right now is probably causing an unstable thyroiditis that can't respond properly to replacement therapy at all times, it is difficult to suggest what to look out for in particular. You're doing everything that's available to you at the moment, and I would continue on this course until you can get to where someone can do a comprehensive review of all affected systems, particularly the thyroid.   Meanwhile, because I believe you may be in the middle of a changing autoimmune situation, I'm going to refer your post to the resident rheumatology expert here, in hopes he may be able to make some additional suggestions. This is unusual, but Hashimoto's being a result of rheumatic changes, this may yield some additional help. Worth a shot, anyway.   Please check back here in a day or so and we'll see if there's anything more helpful posted. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  The cyst may well be causing all or part of the current problem. Then again, GERD is complicating the process and since everything looks good on paper I think you're getting shortchanged. There are few stones left unturned, but one might be a neurology consult, since the ultimate problem is at least partially the processing of sensory signals from the throat to adjacent pain pathways. Neurology might be able to suggest a cause and effect that could be fed back to both endo and GI specialists who would then be under some pressure to help correct the source of irritation or, at the very least, you might be offered some symptomatic relief. When two or more things are going on that cross the same neural pathway it can be difficult, but diagnosis and treating patients never comes with a guarantee it will be simple or easy. I think you need a way to force the issue and this might be the simplest. The most difficult for most people is to simply go back and insist they are not okay and not accept \"it's nothing important\" as an answer to their complaints of reduced quality of life, which your symptoms undoubtedly cause.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here and keep us updated. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "My Endocrinologist put me on a 100mg dose of Cyproterone Acetate for hair loss due to an abnormal hormone level from day 10-15 of my menstrual cycle. After she gave me the prescription, I told her that I wanted to get off my birth control pills (I use them only for cramp management and they're not helping my cramps at all. If anything, they're making things worse because I keep 'missing' my period and the bloating is nuts) but she said to keep taking them, never giving me a reason why. Now for the past few days of taking the Cyproterone Acetate with my birth control pill, I have never been in so much pain in my life. The cramps are unbearable! I really want to just stop my birth control today and hopefully find some relief from the pain and bloating.  My question is: Can I stop taking my birth control and continue on with JUST the Cyproterone Acetate? Or does one not work without the other?  I've called my doctor but she's far away and she has yet to return any of my calls.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  Cyproterone will work just as effectively without BCPs, and in fact, is better without them, since the combination increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis in people who use both. So if anything, you probably should discontinue the BCPs at once and leave word with your doctor that you've done so because of the extreme discomfort and additional risks, and just wanted to let her know in case she has anything she'd like to add as to why she feels you should still be on the other drug.   It's always good to keep a doctor updated, and normally I'd not recomend d/c'ing a medication without first consulting the prescribing doctor, but this is a unique situation and I can see no harm and only benefit from stopping the BCPs now. Just let the doctor know as a way of keeping the relationship professional and open.   Again, this is not something I would ordinarily suggest doing in this order, but given your extreme discomfort and the additional risks imposed, combined with the fact cytoprerone acetate works fine on its own and is not dependent on BCP therapy to work, I can see no reason to continue the BCP, but several reasons to stop them.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you with this and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: high igf-1with  low cortisol serum",
    "content": "Hello --  Given your complex medical history I strongly suspect there are several causes of your various current ills. Steroid use could account for much of this, and  may also have suppressed cortisol production somewhat. The sum of this is sometimes a seeming change of body morphology such as you describe, and it may require a reworking of your medication schedule as well as the tests prescribed (including the brain stem scan). Diabetes probably also figures into this in some way, possibly more than one. Between all these things and early menopause I can see where a lot of this could happen, hopefully resolving to a great extent with proper medical management. I  think it would probably be helpful for you to either have an endocrinological consult or, if you're being followed by  an endocrinologist, to request a second opinion if things don't improve via some concrete changes in your medications and the ruling out of any physical obnormalities of the adrenals and the pituitary gland.   I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck with this, and please follow up with us here, especially if you have any additional information or anything new to report.\n\n",

Just out of curiosity, I have done some tests when I'm not symptomatic and they've been somewhat high - 120's, 140's, and even 209 about an hour after eating pizza one night (I did feel a little strange when it was 209...).  Here's my question - is it possible that my body is used to having high glucose levels, and that when they are in a normal range, that I have hypoglycemic symptoms?  I took a 2 hour GTT last week (as well as fasting insulin, and thyroid levels) but haven't gotten the results yet.  I have not been diagnosed with diabetes, but I am very concerned that I might have it...with a strong family history.\n\n",

All sorts of iodine are taken up more in the thyroid. This is because the thyroid makes its hormone thyroxine from it, so it has a 'pump' to take it up easily. Both I-123 and I-133 are used in radioactive iodine uptake(RAIU) scans. I-133 has a much longer life, and in addition to scans it is also used as a medicine to destroy overactive thyroids(when given in large doses). I-123 has a much shorter half life of nearly 14 hours, that means half of the dose of I-123 has been degraded in that time. Please feel free to share with us the reports of your scan.

    "content": "Hi,  My mom had her entire thyroid removed a few years ago after doctors found a benign tumor on it. She takes thryroxine (sp?) to regulate memory functions and everything but gradually since the surgery her entire personality has changed. I was a senior in high school when it happened and now, 5 years later, I can hardly remember what she was like before but I know she's different. My sister and step-father have noticed the changes too but my mom doesn't think anything is wrong. It's not that she's become unpleasant or even that the changes are very big, but she's so different now and it's awful.  She has these new 'sayings' now where she'll repeat everything three times, like, \"Traffic today was crazy, crazy, crazy\" or \"I'm hungry, hungry, hungry\". I know this sounds silly but it's literally all the time, and she never did this before. She's also kind of....vacant. Not flighty or stupid, but it's almost as if her emotional intelligence has dwindled, like she's not really aware of anything nor does she care. She had a baby 3 years ago and the symptoms got worse. I mean it's fantastic because she's really wrapped up in being a mother again, but I don't know if it's because she's older and more relaxed or something but her parenting style is SO different from what I was used to growing up. I love my mother and I MISS the old her. Has anyone else experienced this? Is it the medication? Will she ever be the same? Please help us, any information would be great.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While I've  actually observed a similar change in one person, there was never any determination that it was due to the thyroidectomy nor to thyroid supplements. Of course there was also a certain problem in that the patient didn't (and I would imagine this would be common) feel there was anything different or wrong -- and, technically speaking, there probably wasn't anything \"wrong.\" Your mother sounds as though she may have experienced some sort of change, and it may involve obsessive-compulsive behavior (she, like the one patient I noted, seems to feel compelled to say certain things in \"sets\"). But there are apparently more disturbing changes going on,  and again,  I thought I was seeing something like this in my one example, but couldn't prove it of course. You, on the other hand, have known  your mom all your life, so I am inclined to believe you're seeing something real, I just don't know what it is, and am unaware of any recognized syndrome of this sort associated with either thyroidectomy or thyroxine.   I'm going to refer this question to both the endocrinology team and the psych team, since the areas may well overlap here. Hopefully someone will come up with some further insights into this. Meanwhile,  please -- seriously -- take  notes, keep a journal, document changes in your mother's behavior as you notice them setting in, and also try to think back and compare these with her \"previous\" personality. So far she seems to be functioning well (clinically speaking) and appears to be no danger to herself or others, so there's not much that can be done unless you can engage her in discussion about this.   I hope this is somewhat helpful, and please check back here to see if anyone from endo or psych advances any other  ideas. Best of luck to you.  Please  keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jennifer LN,  John Kenyon referred your question for review from another perspective.  It's difficult to isolate what is happening because of the thyroidectomy vs. other conditions.  Keeping the journal as John described will be helpful to her physician.  There is a chance that some of her changes are due to the thyroid issue, if she is under-replaced with thyroid hormone.  She would slow down in general, with slow thoughts and difficulty in keeping track of the thread of conversation (thus the repeats at the end of a sentence).  That can be assessed quickly by having a physician (ideally an endocrinologist) obtain a current thyroid profile.  It could impact her parenting style - it would seem much more casual.  The blood test and review will answer that as well.  If the thyroid profile is negative of problems, then it would be good to have psychological review.  The psychologist most likely would evaluate her for obsessive symptoms, and for early dementia.  You didn't mention your mother's age, but dementia can and does occur in some younger (vs. the elderly) persons.    Finally, have you asked her immediately after a word repetition if she noticed what she was doing?  If she doesn't recognize changes, it would be even more important for her to have psychological review.  There could be safety issues in caring for a young child.  I sincerely hope her situation improves.  Faye, RN, MSW\n\n",

    "content": "Hi JenniferLN,  I am from the psychiatry team to add to the responses to your questions about your mother.   The first question to sort through is whether the change in your Mom is due to the thyroid surgery or medication or whether it is something else that is occurring around the same time frame.   If the thyroid surgery is related, then the possibilities include that your mother is now receiving too much thyroxine, too little, or even that her parathyroid glands, which are very close to the thyroid gland, were damaged during surgery. The parathyroid glands regulate the blood calcium level, and disturbances in this can cause emotional changes. This would cause low calcium in your Mom's case, which are not likely to ercause the problems that you described. However, to check all of these hormonal issues, your mother might have herTSH, T4, T3, and calcium checked in a blood test.   Other, less likely medical conditions that can cause personality and thinking changes include folate, copper (a blood test called ceruloplasmin), B12, the hormone cortisol, subtle brain infections and tumors, HIV, conditions such as lupus, hypertension, dementias, multiple sclerosis and others. Don't let this long list scare you, most are very unlikely, and I've mentioned them just for completeness'' sake. You might be sure the your Mom has had a good exam with her internist, mentioning your concerns to him/her.   If the changes in your Mom are due to another cause, then the possibilities for this are many (including the medical conditions mentioned above), and you might see whether she is willing to have a psychiatric evaluation. Psychiatric conditions could include OCD, manic-depression, depression, and others. It would be useful if your mother were willing to allow you and your brother talk with him/her as well, so you can provide information as to the changes you have seen, as your mother may not report them. In addition, if you are convinced that her thinking has gotten simpler and declined in quality, you might have her see a neurologist, to be sure that some kind of problem involving brain functioning isn't occurring.   In any case, I'd have the blood tests done first, then the psychiatric, and then the neurologic.   Is it also possible that your MOM has simply changed over time, given a new baby and (presumably) a new relationship?  Good luck!  -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry to hear about the change in disposition with your mother following the removal of her thyroid gland.  The thyroid gland is what is called an endocrine gland, and produces hormones essential for metabolism, or the physiological actions of the human body.  The thryoxine your mother is taking is synthetic hormones that her thyroid use to produce.  Thryoxine as a replacement may include side effects such as heart palpitations, nervousness, or possibly headaches and bouts of insomnia.    These effects may have an altering effect on your mother's personality.  Or, while your mother, I presume, is fairly young, there is the possibility of a cognitive disorder, such as Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.  I'd suggest you have your mom see a specialist doctor called an encocrinologist to have her assessed by such a doctor.  If this type of doctor believes that your mother's personality changes are due to things other than the hormone replacement she is taking for her thyroid, this doctor may refer your mom to a neurologist for an evaluation.  I wish her well.\n\n",

In the last three years I have developed excessive sleepiness and a fatigue that is starting to become debalitating, I have absolutely no sex drive whatsoever which started before my surgery. I have dry skin that has become so bad, I have scaling on my ankles and have to put olive oil on my face. My eyes have become red rimmed and sore and the treatment for that is making them worse.   I am very sensitive to cold and sleep in a sweater  even though I live in Texas which has a warm climate. I am very prone to constipation, have become very overweight although I have had  a tendancy to run to fat all my life, but I am at my heaviest.  I am irritable , bad tempered and so forgetful , its embarrassing. My hands are covered in painful eczema with little releif. I am frequently struck with colds which have just started turning into sinusitus everytime.  My Ob/Gyn is caring but dismissive. I have considered a thyroid problem but my heart rate is normal and three years ago, preoperatively my thyroid function was normal and my cholesterol low, although my symptoms are significantly worse now.  I am not sure where to go with this or what to do. My insurance allows me to self refer and clearly all is not well with me, but I don't want to go to a string of Doctors who simply just try and treat the symptom relevant to their speciality, I feel there is a root cause to all this and I have even wondered about the medications I take or a possible thyroid problem and of course the aftermath of a bilateral Oophrectomy.

    "content": "Hello --  I think that given the specificity of the symptoms you describe,  an internist should probably be your first stop, but with an eye toward consult with an endocrinologist, as almost all your symptoms could be consistent with hypothyroidism (and your heart rate could easily be normal if not slow with this); while there are other things that could be causing this, and certainly you could have more than one thing going on at the same time,  it seems logical to rule out the most obvious first, and with your symptoms being so very consistent with hypothyroidism, I'd want a general workup for baseline purposes and then it would seem very likely an endocrinology consult would be the next thing on the list. Alternatively you could just jump straight to Point B and self-refer to an endo doctor -- but I really think all the bases should be covered, and really don't see there being that big a likelihood of much benefit from seeing an ob-gyn doctor first or even second, based on what's going on right now.

    "title": "Re: Steroids affects on adrenal tumor",
    "content": "Hello --  The effects of steroids on a benign adrenal tumor could range from nothing to pretty much either end of the scale: a reduction in tumor size or provocation to grow more. It's difficult to predict, because steroids can suppress production of adrenaline but since they duplicate the stress response in the body, they sometimes result in the release of additional cortisol, thence adrenaline. This could do nothing or possibly could stimulate the tumor to grow more. This is something that should be taken up directly with your endocrinologist, since the precise type of tumor, its size, and adrenal chemistry would all figure into a proper answer.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you with this.\n\n",

I have been diagnosed and dealing with with the following which began concurrently about 15 years ago. >  mild to moderate depression - not a firm diagnosis of a clinical disorder but adhd/ocd behaviors are predominant traits. > constant, chronic lichen planus.   Currently I am taking 15 mg of dexedrine daily & daily application of betamethasone diprolene. I plan a return to Topiramate of 100 mg/day upon my next doctors visit.   In the past 6 weeks I have had 4 instances where my body temp. has dropped to hover around 94-95F for an hour or so each episode.   I am also experiencing my 2nd lifetime incident of inexplicable weight gain & fatigue, which defies caloric intake, exercise and abstinence from alcohol...about 15lbs a month, the past 4 months.   Previously, when this happenned I went from 135 to 225lbs & three repeated thyroid tests returned normal. It was the topiramate especially which seemed to help me return to a health weight.  My gp doctor knows little about this med as it was prescribed by a psychiatrist he referred me to as he was convinced I was in denial /hiding poor eating habits etc. The psychiatrist is no longer in my area  but felt there was likely a pituitary link to both the depression and weight gain and maybe even the lichen planus.  I just don't know what to ask for...referral, test...?  Any pointers welcome & appreciated as I am very weary and frustrated.\n\n",

While the vocal weakness post surgery (and/or sometimes lowered register, hoarseness, etc.) can be troubling it usually resolves if there is bruising, because the swelling can take weeks to months to go away, and it doesn't take much swelling to affect the vocal abilities pretty profoundly. You're really early in the course of recovery from this, so it could be a while yet, but your doctor is correct in that this will almost always resolve on its own, although you must remember to not strain at talking in the meantime, which will only prolong the symptoms.

    "content": "I recently had my Vitamin D, Calcium, Magnesium levels checked due to recent onset of Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia and extreme anxiety(panic attacks and generized) after going to ER 2x in one week.  Had miscarriage in end of Nov then cyst on ovary in Dec that did go down in size by Jan.  Had thyroid checked and a lot of other bloodwork like ACE level, B12 level and also checked for Lyme Disease-all negative.  Had neuro work up bc experienced an episode of numbness on side and back of head before heartrate broke to 140. They caught on monitor and have said that right now its IST instead of SVT.  I did have what they think was an SVT episode 11 years ago at age 20 bc I was around 180 resting in ER and responded to Adenosine on second round(but the strips weren't saved).            I'm pretty sure all my crazy symptoms(paresthesias, chest soreness under left collarbone, trouble getting deep breath at rest and during exercise) are pretty much cardiac(also diagnosed with MVP in past), but wanted to rule out that changes were not set off by hormones out of whack since miscarriage/ovarian cyst.  Doing 24 hour urine today to rule out pheo.  Anyway, my Vitamin D 1,25 Dihydroxy came back high; result was 60.7 and reference range from lab corp is 15.9 t0 55.6.  My Vitamin D 25-Hydroxy was within the reference interval of 32-100 on the low side at 34.7.  Calcium was 10.1 and their reference interval is 8.5 to 10.6.  Magnesium within normal range at 2.1.  I researched why Vit D 1,25 might be high and found that it could indicate excess parathyroid hormone, sarcoidosis, or lymphoma.  Should I be worried about my level and, if so, what follow-up tests should I get to rule out the above?  Current meds: now back on Atenolol 50 which controlled me before for 6 years and back on Zoloft up to 100mg, Lovaza 1 gram QD, prenatal vitamin, macrobid 100mg QHS for morning bladder pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  You've got enough factors to suggest IST and/or rare SVT without the slight deviation in D, 1, 125, which was barely over the top. I don't mean to dismiss this, as it should be rechecked later with an eye toward ruling out parathyroid problems or possible sarcoidosis, but it is an awfully small abnormality, and of course the line has to be drawn somewhere. With recent miscarriage, ovarian cyst, MVP and anxiety/panic disorder (which my just be secondary to the other stuff going on), you'd have plenty of justification for either/or. Hormones always can also play a role in all this, as a trigger or providing the little push everything didn't need, but it's not necessarily the sole underlying cause. I think, in this instance, it is just a combo of everything -- a perfect storm. All the meds seem appropriate, and hopefully the tachy stuff is quieted down. I assume the Zoloft is for GAD/PD, but if that doesn't seem to work there is always clonazepam, which is consistently effective, but which some doctors are less than enthusiastic about, because it's a scheduled drug, and because it has been associated with birth defects, it may not be for you.   Please follow up with us as needed, but I think you're back on the right track. If no one has picked up any evidence on EKG of AV nodal re-entry tract, then you should respond well to resumption of the meds you're now on. Good luck to you!\n\n",

It usually is self-correcting and will start to go away about three years after it first appears. This means your notice of some reduction is probably the beginning of this correcting itself now. However, if this  doesn't seem to be going away fast enough to prevent putting a major cramp in your life then there are other options. Surgery is actually the simplest and safest as a rule, with a competent plastic surgeon doing some minor sculpting, and this can almost completely resolve those cases that don't resolve on their own or are considered large enough to be a liability. You also should  be tested for Klinefelter's as a matter of course, if you haven't already (and it appears this hasn't been done). It's simple and can be treated effectively if present, but the problem as you describe it is so common as to be fairly unremarkable, although I sometimes feel doctors don't always realize how big a problem this is for the person affected. I'd be very assertive at this point about having it managed. Oh, and I'm not familiar with Tamoxifen use for this. Definitely have hormone testing done though, and have Klinefelter's ruled out. Other than that, it's wait or have it removed, whichever seems less of annoying.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with  us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  There's nothing I find in the Plan B literature that would suggest a potential connection, but this is, of course, a hormonal issue either way, so it might be worthwhile mentioning to your doctor. It's also possible, though unlikely, this could be related to residual tumor growth, which of course also ought to be ruled out. Finally it could just be an utter coincidence. It's definitely worth a workup, though to be certain it's neither of the first two. If it isn't residual tumor growth (first rule out) then it probably is due to the Plan B pill, even though this seems unlikely. There are, also, other Plan B side effects which could cause at least some of these symptoms. All in all, well worth a visit to the doctor to have these things sorted out in a formal way.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you, and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While I'm not familiar with any documented cases of an acquired tolerance to thyroid replacement therapy, I do think there are some possible explanations for what's happening. First, with your unusual history of developing tolerance for various medications, it could be you are unique in this respect, and this may also turn out to be related to ADD as well. However, the more likely explanation is that the levels are sometimes difficult to fix, and it sometimes  takes some tweaking. This would depend to a great extent on how much of your thyroid is non-functioning, as usually there is some production of thyroxine, and it may change over time (which is why levels must be monitored from time to time). If you've lost some formerly functioning thyroid tissue, the existing dose of Levothyroxine would have to be adjusted upward, and if the levels aren't right when checked, whatever the reason, they'll still need to be adjusted. If they are found to be correct, then your doctor is going to have to look at other possible causes for the symptoms you're experiencing and treat them accordingly. I suspect, however, that the levels may have dropped due to progressive shutdown of surviving thyroid tissue.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Almost every symptom you've listed would be consistent with hyperthyroidism. Your doctor will determine how best to proceed, but most often the thyroid is simply killed off with radiation, which leaves nothing for anyone to notice. You simply have to be followed for a while and take thyroid replacement therapy (as a rule) to compensate for the lack of natural thyroxine. Once the levels have been stabilized you'll just have (again, most likely) to take the medication once a day and be checked every six months or so to be sure your levels are correct. Otherwise there's really not to much to worry about as a rule. You'll likely notice a lot of changes, mostly improvements, as many of your symptoms disappear (a very few you mentioned could possibly be unrelated, but most fit the profile). I don't think this should be too complicated, so I hope this helps answer your question. If not, by all means feel free to follow up with us here. Keep us updated, also, on how this all goes.

    "content": "Hello --  Some  of the symptoms could correlate with a kidney infection. The elevated blood pressure, night sweats, and frequent urination for sure. The chest discomfort could also have been referred from a kidney as well. Lower back pain, in this case, was probably related as well, although that's less than common. The problem was diagnosed as a kidney infection and responded to antibiotics -- so far so good. But the continued nocturnal urgency and frequency doesn't add up. Your doctors don't seem concerned, which is encouraging, but it doesn't eliminate the annoyance of having to get up so often to answer the call.   This could be just a residual problem that will resolve with time. It also could be a sequal to the kidney infection, somehow having triggered interstitial cystitis or a related bladder problem. Have you been worked up by a urologist as yet? This would be an important step and I'm not clear on this from your post.   I'm still thinking about the potential relationship of all this to the tooth implantation, but so far no ideas other than random choice of infection from traveling in the blood. It's probably not important now, at least vs. solving the current  problem.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

I have also read that thyroid meds can cause cancer cells to grow if they are present. As for the high chlolesterol, I have resisted medication as I feel I already have some muscle weakness and don't need additional problems.

    "title": "Re: extremely low cortisol levels",
    "content": "Hello --  I'm rather surprised that your doctor has instituted this replacement therapy based on salivary hormone testing. If your cortisone levels truly are as low as the salivary test indicates, you really need to have a cortisol stimulation test done to determine if you truly do have extremely low cortisol and to determine where, exactly, the problem  really lies (pituitary, adrenal, etc.). The test, a blood test, measures the pituitary's response to stimulation by ACTH. An endocrinologist should administer this test ideally,  or at the least an internist. While gynecologists do see a good deal of this, they are not endocrinologists, and other than dealing with the usual spectrum of female hormone imbalances, are not generally anywhere conversant enough in the subject to make this sort of determination.  There are enough possibilities that you really do need an endo workup to determine just what's really going on and to see if you're on the appropriate replacement therapy (it would seem you're not).  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please do follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

Just recently my thyroid has become overactive and my medication adjusted twice in a month and a half.  Went down to .075 and then .05 mg.  Was on .075 mg for one month.  The first two weeks it seemed to help.  Sweating, irritablility, anxiety and insomnia improved but then it got worse so meds were adjusted to .05 mg.

How long on the new amount of medication before the symptoms and thyroid hormone becomes stable/improve?  Is it normal to go from having Graves to hypo and then overactive again when the radioactive iodine was used to destroy the thyroid?  How can it become overactive again?  My MD said I may not need to take thyroid medication anymore but I was told after the radioactive iodine treatment that I would have to take it for the rest of my life?   I feel like I'm \"crawling out of my skin\" and can't handle the symptoms.   Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

    "content": "Hello --  I know how frustrated you must be by this turn of events, but thyroid disease isn't an either/or proposition every time. It can be varied as in your case. Sometimes it can reverse itself, even when it's presumed to have been destroyed. Sometimes new thyroid -- or parathyroid -- tissue can grow. Tumors or a part of the glad that was not fully radiated can regenerate. This is pretty controversial stuff, but the fact is this  does happen, and when it does a lot of clinicians look at the history as absolute.  While you can't change history, you can change what's going on now. Clearly your thyroid has at least partially reactivated, and the part that's functioning is doing far more than it needs to. That you're still on Levothyroxin now that you're making your own again makes little sense, it would seem. It should be an appropriate provocative test for your doctor to simply wean you off it.   Since Grave's disease is often part of the up-and-down cycle of Hashimoto's variant, and Hashimoto's is an autoimmune disease, and since autoimmune disease tends to \"wander\" from one system to another, what's going on with you isn't as surprising to me as it might be to some people.   Some exotic blood testing is probably in order, but it seems likely you're going to have to wean off the Levothyroxine for a while at least, and maybe go through another cycle of the opposite treatment. The sooner this is initiated the better you'll feel, since treating the anxiety symptoms of Graves' disease is usually not very helpful.   I hope this helps you to understand what is probably going on. It's unusual, but not unheard of. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

However, there is also the Awful Coincidence rule, which reminds us that there can be more than one thing going on in one patient at the same time. The symptoms  do all sound like those related to hypothyroidism, but also, and especially in combination with euthyroid, could make them more pronounced. One is diabetes, although with all the blood work you've likely had done, it's unlikely you would have developed this. Yet again, however, inadequately controlled hypothyroid will predispose to diabetes if there is a latent tendency to start with.   You do have a family history of diabetes.   If this hasn't been ruled out via glucose tolerance test and hemoglobin A1c, then it needs to be ruled out (or in) ASAP. While there are some other, more obscure possibilities,  this would be the next biggest one that jumps out. I'd strongly suggest a GTT, unless you know for certain you do not have diabetes.

    "content": "Hi there --  The symptoms your husband is experiencing are not withdrawal symptoms but are, rather, his body adapting to something that has been missing, and it is a reaction that doesn't always happen in all patients, but is seen  occasionally. It should slowly resolve, but low testosterone levels generally will require repeated injections. Often the patient will adapt to this after a while, but in the meantime it's probably wise for the doctor to help him out with the symptoms,  which can be pretty uncomfortable in certain instances. Sometimes either anxiolytic drug like Ativan or Klonpin can take the edge off, in small doses for a limited time. If a longer term solution is going to be needed, then sometimes a low-dose beta blocker (such as metaprolol) is offered to quiet things without running the risk of a yo-yo effect. Hopefully your husband's doctor is aware of these possible palliative measures and would be willing to prescribe something to help balance out the very real depression and the artificially-induced anxiety symptoms, a pretty terrible combination.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you both.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Relationship between hemochromatosis & Graves Disease?",
    "content": "Hello --  I've been unable to find any links between hemochromocytosis and Graves' disease. Logically it would seem there should be,  but in terms of the literature I've found nothing to back this up, especially since hemochromocytosis is a genetically-acquired disease and Graves' is an autoimmune disorder which,  even when heritable, involves different chromosomal defects. Further,  Hep C, which you may or may not have, is viral in origin, and so wouldn't be caused by any possible damage inflicted by hemochromocytosis. It can be acquired, by the way, by many simple contact mishaps other than sexual.   I think what's happening here, lacking any proof of a connection between Graves' disease and hemochromocytosis, that you simply have more than one thing going on, which is very often the case,  and which, when it happens, can thoroughly cloud a clinical picture of any given patient, due to the tendency to assume all symptoms are being caused by a single cause.   I hope this is helpful to you. By all means please follow up here as needed, and especially if you have any new information  to add or anything new to tell us. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

I also, on my own, decided to go to the health food store and purchase Raw Adrenal(165 mg) & Pituitary supplements (80 mg) These are made in New Zealand and are bovine products. I take the Synthroid on an empty stomach, in the morning.  Half an hour later, I then take, with foodothie, 1 adrenal and 1 pituitary pill.  I feel great and I feel like I am bouncing off the walls.  But by 2:00 p.m., I feel very fatigued, have trouble concentrating and want to sleep at my computer.  This is not typical of me.  Since I have been taking these (about 30 days), I have gained over 20 pounds. Some of that was holiday gain, but not all of it.  I am not really eating out of the ordinary to where I am able to maintain.  I am wondering if the adrenal and pituitary supplements would somehow cause weight gain?

However, I do wonder if your Synthroid levels are correct. Have they been checked regularly since you started the therapy? Early on it's sometimes a delicate balancing act to get this just right, and if it's too little, even though the supplements may be working for you like caffeine, your overall metabolism would still lag and there could be weight gain. There's little else I can think of to explain this. Hopefully you've had or will soon have a follow up level check to be certain it doesn't need to be raised. And if it does, you may find you don't need (or even want) the supplements.   Hope this helps. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Testosterone supplementation will often cause accelerated male pattern baldness, which would  probably have happened later on anyway, as it is generally a heritable trait. While it must be very frustrating to have to make this trade, I would think it worthwhile,  and while  there are some balness remedies which seem to have support among the alternative medicine community, I'm unaware of any specfic, proven way to reverse this. Still, these remedies are usually pretty harmless, and if they help, then all the better. However, I'm unaware of any medically sound ways to prevent this, although hopefully your doctor will keep you updated on any developments in this area.   Meanwhile, going fully bald is sometimes a very popluar and  effective male \"enhancement\" fashion statement, so it isn't as though baldness is the curse it once was considered. I think I know more men who are bald by choice than  by genetics right now, for what it's worth.  Good luck to you with this. Hopefully the baldness will be self-limiting.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello  Sorry for the long story but I think it will be helpful to full understand my situation in hopes that SOMEONE can help me figure out the correct treatment.  I am a 31 year old female and for the last 3 years I have the Mirena IUD as my birth control method.  When I was 20 years old I went on Ortho Tri Cyclen  (regular) BC pills to help with menstrual cramps and my hormonal cystic acne I was having right before my period.   I was on these pills for 6 years until I got off of them to become pregnant with my 2 kids.   The pills were good and bad.  My periods became extremely regular, the acne cleared up tremendously and the cramps stopped.  However, I started experiencing pretty bad mood swings and always felt tired.    Due to the Mirena, I haven't had my period in 2.5 years which has been great BUT I am having side effects that I didn't realize could be coming from the Mirena which include:  1)terrible cystic acne on my chin and forehead month after month the last 3 years.  The acne is considerably worse now than when I was in my 20's 2) weight gain about 15 lbs the last 2 years 3) extreme fatigue the last 2 years, some mornings it is hard for me to get out of bed and about 3PM in the afternoon I could fall asleep at my desk 4) I am starting to have shooting pains in my breasts during the day 5) I am starting to have a numbness feeling in my left arm 6) I am pretty sure my thyroid is out of whack now or my adrenal system due to these synthetic hormones  I have seen my OBGYN 3 times about some of these issues and he keeps telling me that the \"hormones from the Mirena are not released into the bloodstream and in no way the Mirena is causing this.  I went to him a month ago to remove it and he refused and said let's try the OTC BC pills along with the IUD and that should help.    I found a website called curezone.com and MANY women who have the Mirena IUD are suffering from the same symptoms I have described above so I strongly believe there is a connection btwn the Mirena and these symptoms.  Next week my doctor will be removing my IUD.  I will not leave his office until he does.  So here are my questions: 1) Are there types of saliva or blood tests I could take to check my thyroid or adrenal system to see why I am feeling so fatigued? 2) How long should I wait post removal of the MIrena to have these tests done, if you do recommend having tests done 3) I really would like to get the acne under control- what other options do I have that don't involve synthetic hormones to keep it under control?  This problem is truly bothering me.   Please help!  I am at a loss here and just want my life back!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would agree that all your symptoms are not likely to be related to the Mirena.  If you have it removed you will soon learn if any of the effects were related.  If not, you've lost the chance at a great contraceptive method.  But, if you believe it is the cause then getting it out is your best plan.  I am inclined to agree that you should definitely have your thyroid checked.  Most of the symptoms you describe could come from that fairly common disorder.  You should not have to wait to have the testing done; do it when you see your doctor.      As for the acne; if you were to decide to leave the Mirena in place you could try Accutane.  This is a very effective, permanent treatment.  You usually take it for about 20 weeks and blood testing is required to monitor for drug side effects.  It works well but contraception is required while taking it since birth defects can result if you should become pregnant while taking it or soon after.  The Mirena is so reliable you would have peace of mind during the treatment.    There are other options for acne and it would be worthwhile meeting with a dermatologist who could explain all your options.  Sometimes a low dose antibiotic is helpful in conjunction with topical treatment, usually consisting of benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.  These do not have to be in a special, expensive acne treatment program and you should use these creams sparingly after washing your face with mild soap and fingertips (no scrubbing).  Special scrubbing products can actually aggravate the condition because nothing can penetrate deep enough and it will damage.  Acne develops when oil glands become clogged and filled with a specific bacteria.  This is why antibiotics sometimes help.     Hopefully you will get answers soon and find the best way to deal with your particular challenge.  Good luck.  Best wishes\n\n",

Since you are consciously attempting to conceive, you have a unique opportunity to avoid any risk to the baby by postponing the attempt until the disease is confirmed and stabilized. The relatively short wait will seem like nothing compared with the risk of a lifetime of problems that need not happen.   I hope  this is helpful to you. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Your doctor is right -- especially in this context. The thyroid antibodies must be seen in context of various factors regarding the patient, and don't have an absolute meaning. However, since you were already diagnosed with Graves' , then possible hypothyroidism, it can be safely assumed that you have an autoimmune disorder which is affecting the thyroid and could be affecting other systems as well, either now or in the future. The antibodies simply must be tracked and compared with the previous levels.   As for the symptoms such as anxiety, panic attacks, dizziness, etc., these are common both with the whole spectrum of thyroid problems as well as with many other autoimmune problems, these need to be treated symptomatically. While the thyroid levels themselves may be WNL for now, and therefore don't justify treatment, and while the antibodies themselves aren't treated, any treatment you get at present should be supportive/symptomatic, at least until the autoimmune response can be more closely identified. Then a management plan can be formulated. It's frustrating, but this is the erratic course this sort of thing often takes, so it does require some patience.   Good luck to you with this, and please do follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  There is nothing I know of in the literature regarding long-term side effects of the synacthen test, and no clear reason why this should happen because of it. The few potential side effects are felt during or right after the test.   Based on your history, however, it seems likely there is something going on in the area of the pituitary (if not actually in or on it) which is progressing and has begun to cause extrapyramidal effects which have now progressed to wholesale seizures. While the seizure activity is probably coincidental to an extent, it may be indirectly related, either because of some process in the head up around the pituitary gland, or perhaps the brief rush of adrenal stimulation \"threw a switch\" and helped set off this process without there being a direct link to the synacthen. Hopefully a neurologist is following you intensely for this and the appropriate studies are being done to locate the underlying cause so as to manage it better.  I hope this is helpful.

    "title": "Possible estrogen dominance? Symptoms fit",
    "content": "the way this came about is actually kind of silly. i've been blessed with very full lips. one of my friends made the comment that women with naturally fuller lips have more estrogen. being inquisitive as they come, i entertained this theory and actually google it. well, i didn't actually find out if it was true or not but i did stumble upon a few pages regarding 'estrogen dominance' and excessive estrogen. for the past eight months of so i've been having great difficulty with my periods and the symptoms of excessive estrogen actually fit!    about a week or so before my period... WATER RETENTION - My body retains water like no other. My entire body swells, particularly my extremities. This month I gained about 15 pounds of water weight. DEPRESSION - I have no desire to have any contact with the outside world and a complete sense of hopelessness washes over me. Its also made a lot worse by the fact that none of my clothing fits me! I am a size 4/6 but during that time I can barely fit into a size 8/10. IRRITABILITY/MOOD SWINGS IBS really flares up around my periods IRREGULAR CYCLES  I always pretty much have a.. LOW LIBIDO (and i'm only 18) FATIGUE I am always exhausted with 7/8 hours of sleep FUZZY THINKING i've noticed while i am still as sharp, my recall is sort of impaired. And this year I've developed ASTHMA, another symptom   my periods have always been really irregular -- even on birth control! (I started YAZ three months ago -- my pms symptoms didn't change the first two cycles, got worst the last though) i was heavier when I was younger, but dropped the baby weight. I am on my track team and run 4-5 miles a day but I just can't kick the pocket of fat on my abdomen and thighs. I know to lower estrogen levels they recommend exercise, so thats really not my issue. If I don't run though, I am 10x more miserable and my pms is a lot worse.  One of the main reasons this is really worrying me is because as you may or may not know, excessive estrogen significantly raises a woman's risk for reproductive cancer/prostate cancer. my mom has breast cancer at a fairly young age and an overwhelming amount of my immediate family has had prostate cancer of some kind. I am going to my gynecologist this Thursday to discuss if I should discontinue birth control. Should I definitely express my worry or asked to be referred to an endocrinologist to have my hormone levels checked?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Possible estrogen dominance? Symptoms fit",
    "content": "Hello, This is very hard to answer since the symptoms you describe could be attributed to many different causes.  When someone suggests one possible cause and you rush to learn all about it, it is very common to see your symptoms on the list.  This is because many disorders have the same symptoms and most people do not have all the symptoms of any disease so by the time you spot several on the list it is tempting to go off thinking \"this is it.\"  Your best bet is to discuss your concerns with your doctor at your appointment.  Labs can be requested and analyzed.  If anything is suspicious and needing specialized care your doctor can refer you.  However, hormonal problems are so common, it is very likely  your doctor can handle it.    Estrogen dominance is most often diagnosed in older perimenopausal women whose progesterone levels are decreasing but we also know that our environment is infusing much estrogen into all of us so it has been said we probably all have estrogen dominance to some degree.    You could just have a severe case of PMS - one of the disorders that can cause the symptoms you describe.  Thyroid disorders can also bring some of these signs.  This can easily be checked by your gynecologist.  You also mentioned IBS and certainly some of your symptoms can come with that.  Even depression itself can manifest with fatigue, low libido, fuzzy thinking and irritability.  We have so many different specialty areas that we sometimes assume we must see a particular doctor and self-diagnose in order to even know who to see.  In truth, your primary doctor can get the diagnosis started and offer treatment options.  Take a list like the one you have here so you don't miss any of your concerns in communicating with your doctor.  A complete exam and health history, including symptoms is the most important thing for you to do now.  Please let us know  how it turns out.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 24 years old and for about 3 years I have been losing hair all over my body in patches after a bad case of mono on my and throat infection.   I'm not entirely sure what is making it fall out being a lack of estrogen but im pretty sure it's not male baldness pattern as no one in my family has the gene and the hair is thinning everywhere including my sideburns. I have had extensive blood tests done for alopecia and auto-immune disease which came up negative  So I went to the endocronoligist and he gave me these results. I had a level of .8 out of 1.6-8.0 range on my FSH and from what I understand your FSH is your estrogen which is very important to your hair follicles.    The thing is my doctor thinks this level is fine while i read in many places on the internet that this a bad level and it could be the reason for my hair loss. My doctor didn't talk about treating this and I would like a few opinions on if this is an ok level for a male and if you think that a level this low could be causing hair loss. I just did more blood work for FSH and LH and a few other things again this week. I also went on propecia not sure if it would help if this is the case. Any input on a healthy level for a male would be great and how to talk to my doctor if this is a problem and he doesnt see it as one.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: FSH and LH In MEN",
    "content": "Hello --  Low FSH levels in men are likely to result in hair loss or at least failure to grow new hair. Low FSH is consistent with pituitary and other endocrinological disorders. It's difficult to know if this is connected to your bout of mono or not, but it's also probably not important at this point. You could always have something else going on coincident with that episode or aggravated by it. If your doctor doesn't express an interest in pursuing this toward a diagnosis and management of symptoms, you may need find a second opinion or a different endocrinologist.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's a little over a month ago. I had slightly elevated TSH levels (4.6) but the rest of my levels were normal. Even though I had signs of being hypothyroid my GP didnt think it was necessary to treat it and sent me on my way. I chose, instead, to take myself to an Endo. My Hashimoto's was diagnosed via an ultrasound of my thyroid that showed a very malformed thyroid, almost no isthmus (sp?), and a small nodule. He put me on 75mgs of Synthroid. I discussed my chronic joint pain, light sensitivity, irregular periods etc...he suggested that I see a Rheumatologist. Ive made an appointment but have to wait until the middle of February.  Since then Ive developed a rash called erythema annulare centrifugum. I have one lesion on my left breast and a good 10 more forming across my breasts and ribcage. I went back to my GP who ran a rheumatology panal and suggested I make an appointment at the rheumatologist. She didnt want to treat the rash b/c she wanted the rheumotologist to see it. I get the results back and they were normal. My CBC is normal and my ANA is 44. I went into to see my endo b/c of the issues that I had in the past with the GP. He said the same thing but was concerned that I had gained 6lbs since my last appointment a month earlier. I explained to him that I had gained 50lbs in the past 3 years no matter how hard I diet etc...so he is checking my cortisol levels. He didnt tell me why but Im making the assumption that he is checking me for Cushings.   Im not so worried about what is wrong with me..Im more concerned about not finding out what is wrong with me. It's upsetting to diet and not lose a pound but to gain 6lbs is tough.  My other symptoms....Everything that I can think of  Weight gain Oily skin Flushed face No Infertility (I have several children) Acne Eyebrows fell out Excessive hairgrowth on face Little or no body hair Sebacious Cyst on lip (removed) Nosebleeds left nostril only Joint pain Muscle pain itchy skin erythema annulare centrifugum Excessive urination Always tired Sensitive to light Irregular periods heavy menstration Raynauds low blood pressure\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  So far you've determined, through your own persistence, that Hashimoto's disease is present. You have additional symptoms, some of which are commonly seen in conjunction with hypothyroidism (ie: Raynaud's), and you have some signs and symptoms which could indicate Cushing's and/or Sjogren's, both frequently part of a larger autoimmune problem, along with the previously mentioned disorders.  Your rheumatologist seems to be following this appropriately, and the problem you pose, that of determining just \"what is wrong\" with you, can be frustrating, because where autoimmune disease is concerned, the rules become pretty vague much of the  time, as new symptoms show up and new systems become involved, even as others become functional again. It can be infuriating. Having a good and supportive team of GP and rheumatologist will be a big help. So far, actually, so good. This can take quite a while to become  clarified and requires some patience on the part of the patient (which may be where the term originated).   Good luck to you with this. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I am a 39 yr female who has been diagnosed with Hypothyriodism, PCOS, dismetabolic syndrome and Hiatal hernia/gerd. I am taking levothroid (125mcg once a day), Metformin HCL 1000 MG twice a day), Nexium (40 MG once a day). After several years of trying to figure out my medical issues my family doctor sent me to an endocrinologist. I have been seeing an endocrinologist for about a year now and he is the one who has prescribed the metformin for the PCOS.  As of lately I am experiencing vertigo especially when laying down, widespread pain and low body temp. I normally run a body temperature of 98.6-99.1 but the last few weeks or so I have been running around 97.4-97.8. My skin feels cold but at times I can feel quite hot and even sweaty.  I also have noticed wide bp fluctuations. When laying my bp drops dramatically and has gone as low as 89/58 but I seem to have normal to even high bp when sitting. I am also experiencing widespread pain in my legs, back, neck, shoulder... Ah heck you name it I seem to have it...  I am beginning to question my own sanity because no one seems to be able to find the exact problem. I cant help but wonder if there is not an underlining problem that just has not been diagnosed that could be causing all of my conditions. I have not called to schedule another appointment with my endo to discuss these new problems because I was just there a few weeks ago at which time he seemed rushed (we only have two endo's in our large town), he told me that he wanted me to continue my meds and see me back in March and that my testosterone levels were still high even after 6 months of treatment. Should I call with the new developments or could these symptoms be related to all my diagnosis? Please give me some advice on what I should be doing or what questions to ask my doctor because I am really beginning to feel like I have hit the end of the rope.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  First, you realize that PCOS is probably secondary to metabolic syndrome (aka: dysmetabolic syndrome or syndrome X), and this usually involves some problem with the metabolism of sugars. PCOS isn't treated directly with antidiabetic drugs, but antidiabetic drugs may sometimes help with syndrome X, which may, in turn, reduce PCOS.   It is this latter that I suspect may be causing the new symptoms, since they are likely due to hormonal imbalance caused by PCOS. At least that's the most obvious possibility.  I don't feel you should hesitate to contact your endo to inform him of new or worsening symptoms. That's why he's there. If his workload is too great he'll have some decisions to make about career choices, but you don't need to restrain yourself out of concern for this. We don't want you hitting the end of the rope,  especially because you don't feel you are owed the support of your specialist.   By all means call in these new developments. I hope I've shed a little light on what may be going on. Good luck to you and please do keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 18 years old, male, Asian, about 170 cm in height. I am still growing naturally, and my current height is certainly within the acceptable range but I was thinking of maybe obtaining some sort of boost.  After browsing the internet I have found several products and stopped on the website http://www.HumanGrowthHormones.com, which advocates using HGH for growth purposes. Being hot-headed I ordered a bottle of their product but upon receiving it am currently having doubts.  Should this product be trusted? After some research I have seen that the FDA has not approved the use of HGH for other that disease-treating purposes. However, the active ingredients on the bottle is not the growth hormone itself but several amino acids (such as L-Tyrosine, L-valine, L-isoleucine and several others) as well as the Chromium Glucose Tolerance Factor. The quantity of each amino acid in the \"proprietary blend\" is not mentioned.  Should I continue taking this product? If so, is there any side effects I should be worried about? I have read several undesirable effects linked to amino acid supplements online, even including certain fatal prion diseases.  Apologies for the rather long post, and any recommendations or answers are greatly appreciated.  Thanks a lot,  Steve\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Steve --  While there's not much to be concerned about regarding side effects, so long as the supplements are taken as directed, there's also not much to get excited about in terms of weight management. Tyrosine does have the potential,  in high enough dosages, to cause agitation, increased heart rate, anxiety, etc. The problem with these supplements acquire via on-line sources, is that they are not well-regulated, so it's difficult to know with  any certainty what you're ingesting in terms of actual doseage, not to mention purity.    I generally discourage use of this sort of vague \"miracle\" supplement, especially if acquire through on-line sources, since at least some of the more reputable retail \"health\" outlets take some care with being knowlegeable and carrying well-produced and fairly correct brands. This is still sometimes a questionable practice, but at least you have some chance of knowing precisely what you've bought.   I hope this is helpful to you.

    "content": "Hello.  Thank you for your help.  I am a 41yo woman with an excellent health history.  I started running athletically last year, I am training for a marathon.  I work in health care.  Recently I ran a long course and afterward experienced symptoms similar to those I had when diagnosed with a goiter and hyperthyroid problems at the beginning of my last pregnancy: increased heart rate, fatigue, headache, light sensitivity, anxiety.  I ran my own labs:  TSH = 0.384, Free T4 = 1.17, Free T3 = 3.0, and Antithyroglobulin antibody = 131.  My non-fasting triglycerides are at 44.    My symptoms were bad for about ten days, then improved and I have been feeling mostly better the past week, but not great.  I went for another long run today and felt O.K. but did not have nearly my normal level of energy.  I wear a heart rate monitor to track my running statistics and was surprised to find when I got home that my heart rate for the last third of my run jumped suddenly to consistently over 200 (max 240) compared to my normal 140 or so.  Again, I feel O.K. but not great and my heart rate is still a little high several hours later (85 vs. my normal 60-65).      I realize my labs are somewhat subclinical.  I want to keep training.  I am a breastfeeding mom.   Would you advise me to seek treatment?  Is it likely that I would be started on PTU?  Should I just wait and repeat my TSH if my symptoms worsen?  Will I cause muscle damage, or moreover, is it likely that I am endangering my health to continue training?  I have been trying L-Carnitine and have been thinking that it perhaps helps somewhat with the headache.  After my run today I am wondering whether I should be more concerned about my heart.  I'm at a point in my life when  I really don't want to have to slow down and stop running if I can avoid it.  Please let me know your thoughts.  I sincerely appreciate it!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Training for distance running...Thyroid trouble",
    "content": "HI there -  Everything you describe regarding your body's response to vigorous exercise corresponds with your original diagnosis of hyperthyroidism with goiter, yet your labs (which should be repeated completely independently) are not only subclinical but within normal limits near as I can tell (given that T-4 range will probably soon be lowered to .3 - 3.0). You may have triggered a response by your running program (remember, thyroid disease is not a fixed entity and can be variable, which is why you need to have levels checked periodically). Since your levels will likely be similar to what they were (about normal) when retested, you may not be put on PTU. However, you need to have the cardiac response to exercise evaluated anyway, independent of the thyroid issues. While what you report is commonly seen in hyperthyroidism, and your own labs don't reflect a parallel with the symptoms, you do have something going on. With your history the first suspect has to be hyperthyroidism. You also may have learned, due to your original bout with hyperthyroid state, some faulty breathing patterns  which have been found, in studies, to affect runners and other athletes with this problem. There isn't increased airway reactivity, but the respiratory muscles are weaker and for some reason the compensatory breathing pattern becomes faulty (rapid and shallow).   You should probably have a formal thyroid workup as well as LFT and at least a resting 12-lead EKG. Correlate these findings to determine what may be going on. It  could still be thyroid-related, or it may be some sort of secondary heart problem (not structural, but perhaps due to residual sympathetic imbalance) (Kendrick, O'Reilly and Laszlo).   You won't likely cause muscle damage, at least not of any lasting sort, but you could precipitate thyroid storm by working out at your existing pace, even though your labs appear, at worst, subclinical and at best, normal, right now. There's also the risk of developing A-fib, as you know.   I just don't think self-management is the best route. We in the business tend toward this sort of approach quite often, and there's an old maxim that covers this: \"A doctor who treats himself has a fool for a patient.\" Doesn't have to be a doctor to fit the category, but we can really make some bad calls when we're at the center of our own process. For this reason I hope you'll have the affected systems evaluated and come up with both a diagnosis and  program that will fit your situation. If you do wind up hyperthyroid (and it does seem likely), there are ways of accomodating a pretty solid fitness regimen. Certain things simply have to be recognized first.  Hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

I am 34, stand 6'1, and weigh 207 lbs.  The first time this happened I ate pizza from a local pizzeria.  The 2nd time, I ate chicken from KFC, the last time I ate chicken wings from Pizza Hut.  These episodes never happen when I smoke pot at home--only when I am elsewhere.  I realize that stopping pot smoking is the obvious solution, but I am curious why this has begun to happen recently and why vomiting seems to purge my system and make me feel better.\n\n",

    "content": "Ok, I will not say that marijuana is good for you.  Of course I would urge you to stop it.  However, I wonder if these symptoms are related to the drug.  Do you vomit like this when not using the drug?   You could have some underlying problems there.  The marijuana may have been the cause or could be aggravating it.   Anytime I hear of someone \"blacking out\" I would say go and see a doctor NOW.  There is just absolutely no way of telling you what these symptoms mean without some close medical evaluation.  I would also question weather or not you are using other drugs along with the marijuana, prescribed or otherwise.  (I do not judge here.  I am not saying this for purposes of belittling you as a person).  It just sounds as if you need some help with the drug issues but also just as important you need medical attention for the symptoms you are describing.  \"Blacking out\" and chronic vomiting is nothing to ignore.  Best wishes to you, Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

I do not use any other drug at all--except for nicotine and very occasionally I drink a beer or two.  I take no prescriptions or any drugs other than an occasional \"Aleve\" when I have a headache.  The marijuana smoking is done probably 3-4 times a month while I drink 1-2 beers a month, at the most.  I definitely appreciate the concern with the \"drug issues\" but until recently I did not have any \"issues\" other than an expensive and unhealthy addiction to cigarettes.  for right now, I am monitoring how I feel and have stopped drinking any alcohol.\n\n",

My weight has ballooned, as in I've put on well over 10kg, my hair is coming out more in my brush...  I have been tired, and yet it takes me forever to get to sleep.  I've also developed, which has gotten worse in the last week or 2, an anxiety - the fear of death... which pretty much leads into a depression of wondering what the point of life is, leaving me somewhat listless.  On top of that I have become more irritable and I'm getting my period more frequently.  Is it possible that my thyroid medication needs to be tweaked?  Because I would love to feel healthy and well again, both mentally and physically.  Thank you for taking to time to read.  Cheers, Deean.\n\n",

    "title": "young male...low testosterone/growth hormone? help!",
    "content": "Okay so I'm an 18 year old male, but I have some childish and/or feminine physical features, like shrunken small upper body (rib cage, chest) and wider than normal hip bones ( really low .75-.80 waist-to-hip ratio for male), lower body fat concentration, really emaciated/skinny, not very tall, and little facial or body hair. I think one cause of this might be that mother raised me without enough food and with a lot of soy milk and tofu all through childhood and puberty. I've read it somewhere and heard in that presentation you did that the high estrogen content of soy can interfere with hormonal development, so I'm guessing that's the main culprit, as well as unfortunate genetics, lack of exercise, and slightly off fetal development. As far as I know, I do have normal genitalia, though somewhat below average size, and no sign of female nipples or breasts. I think I might have had or still have low testosterone and low growth hormone levels. But still I feel like I need to do something because I can hardly face the world with my non-masculine body, it's embarrassing, uncomfortable, and some people don't accept me. I was made fun of a lot, laughed at, and not respected or taken seriously at all in high school. Everyone thought I was \"gay\" and girly. I was wondering what advice people have for me to get a more male appearance. Should I see an endocrinologist or what? Do you think hormone therapy is right for me? Growth hormone and/or androgen/testosterone or what? Also, what kind of dietary and exercise changes should I make as well as hormone and medical solutions? I can tell more if anyone needs more information to help me diagnose and solve this problem.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "To answer your question, your doctor can order a simple blood test to determine your testosterone levels; then you don't have to \"guess\" whether you have normal levels or not, and that can tell you IF you need to consider treatment for that condition.  As far as your genetalia goes, \"average\" seems to be a range from 5\" to 7\" of penile length (rarely honestly measured it seems), so unless you are well out of that range, you are probably \"average\".  Male secondary sex characteristics such as \"hairyness\" vary so widely around the world, that there is no real \"average\"; some guys are hairy some guys aren't; that doesn't make you any less \"male\" if you don't happen to be one of the hairy ones; literally billions of men aren't, and many that are have hairy chests at the expense of going bald in their middle-age years (male pattern baldness).  Just get the hormone tests done if your current state of development is bothering you and go from there based on the results.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Extremly High Levels of DHEA",
    "content": "A couple things...  first, there is no connection between levels of the chemicals you are describing and 'neurotransmitter levels'.   I'm not sure where the sample was taken... blood?  Urine? Spinal fluid?  Brain tissue?  Hopefully not the latter!  I suspect you are talking about blood levels-- urine levels would be even more worthless, although blood levels alone are worthless.  It is not difficult for any cell in the body to make many of the substances that you listed;  some are specifically from gonadal tissue (testes or ovaries), and some from the adrenal gland, and some from pretty much everywhere (glycine).  Some of these compounds have dual functions, including a role as neurotransmitter in the brain... but getting blood levels tells you absolutely nothing about the brain levels.  The 'blood brain barrier' separates the brain fluids from the blood...but that isn't even the issue!  You have tons of circulating serotonin, norepinephrine, glycine, etc... but it doesn't even come from the brain--it is made all over the place, particularly the sympathetic ganglia and the adrenal gland.  I have heard the layperson's talk about 'depleting neurotransmitters'- say during addiction, etc... but it is all nonsense.  Yes, in Parkinson's there is a depletion of dopamine, not from the inability to make it, but because of the destruction of cells that contain dopamine.  And yes, meds that block breakdown of acetylcholine will reduce the progression of Alzheimer's for a few months, but again, this is a case of massive cell death throughout the brain-- nothing at all like the situation in people without that specific disease.    But beyond all of this... we do check levels of some of the chemicals you describe- not to treat psychiatric illness, but for endocrine conditions.  But your numbers are all off!  Here is a pretty good source for normal lab values:  http://www.aids.org/factSheets/120-Norm ... alues.html   Note, though that for DHEA for example the results are in the standard format of nanograms per deciliter (ng/dl).  Taking your value of 1717 pg/ml and converting it, you get a value of 170 ng/dl, which is in the normal range-- if anything on the low normal side of things.  Most of your listed 'normal ranges' are not at all accurate;  Testosterone varies by 10-fold or more in normal individuals, for example.  And glycine levels have nothing to do with anything!  I fear that you have a chiropractor who has learned something from a course that he took in Arizona-- he learned how to make some extra money by billing for bogus lab tests in trusting individuals!  That guy deserves the boot!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Lisa,  You have had a detailed answer to your question about your abnormal levels of various tests from Dr. Junig.  I will add to his response by pointing out that you seem able to go out to see your chiropractor, so there is a way for you to go out for further physical examination to see if there is a specific problem going on.  It's not clear where your testing was done, or by whom.  However, if those levels are accurate, it is essential that you see a physician - particularly an endocrinologist, if possible.  While it's unklikely, we do not want to overlook possible tumors of the pituitary, adrenal or even thyroid glands.  Most are benign, but can cause the high level of discomfort that you are experiencing.  It's not that anxiety is causing the high levels - it would be more likely that the high levels are causing anxiety.  Please see a physician as soon as you can to rule out a major disease.

I do not have them daily like I was and I feel good enough to leave the house during evening times. Mornings are always the worst.

    "content": "There certainly can be medical conditions that cause or contribute to panic attacks or episodes of extreme anxiety. Are you currently taking any medications? If you are taking an antidepressant (SSRI such as Zoloft or Lexapro) your dose may be too high or the medication may need to be changed. Otherwise, an endocrinologist would most likely be your best bet for further analysis of any physical cause for your symptoms. Unfortunately, you say you cannot leave your home due to the anxiety. Perhaps if you were to consult a physician via telephone, you would feel more secure about scheduling an appoinment. Your primary care physician may be willing to prescribe a small amount of anti-anxiety medication that would enable you to make a visit to the doctor, perhaps if you take along a trusted friend. Good luck.  Beverly H.\n\n",

    "title": "cyst in sinus possible pituitary tumor??",
    "content": "Hi I am a 25 year old female.  I recently had an MRI of the head and a large cyst was found in my sinuses.  The neurologist didn't tell me much about it other than I need to see a ENT soon and have it removed (don't know the exact size or location; the Dr. used the term \"substantial\" and said it needed to be taken care of soon or I could have complications later).   I had went to the neurologist because this past summer, I had a sudden onset of symptoms after playing tennis.  Intense pressure headache, intense deep burning pain in neck, burning pain behind the eye, and later on partial paralysis in left arm, tics of the left arm and right leg, difficulty walking due to weakness.  The symptoms had come on suddenly and waxed and waned in intensity for about two days before going away.  Although, since then I have had some burning pain in the neck similar, but no where as intense.  This pain comes and goes, but isn't very noticeable.  I had gone to the ER and CT scan was normal.  And the recent MRI of the head---besides the cyst, everything else was normal.  My neurologist explained I had a complicated migraine and doesn't think the cyst is related. ( I disagree???)  Recently in the past 4 years I have had ongoing undiagnosed issues.  I am extremely fatigued, have upper back pain and weakness(can't hold my self up properly), weakness of the legs and arms, leg cramps, tingliness of the legs sometimes arms, numb toes at times, shooting and stabbing pains in legs and chest, chest pains and heart palpitations, frequent urination ( way too much urinating; I get up about ten times in the middle of the night and early morning to urinate; now that im pregnant, its about twenty; i am not exaggerating; this is not a joke nor is it funny; i know that is might be contributing to the fatigue) GERD, frequent yeast infections, extremely dry skin, itchy skin, acne(had very clear skin two years ago), excessive facial hair of the cheeks, chin, upper lip( has grown in in the past two years) and excessive body hair of the abdomen and inner thighs ( I didn't have body hair like this; Im half korean and my brother has less facial hair than i do; its not typical of my family)  scalp hair loss, and weight gain in the past three years that's again not typical (about 40 pounds; about 15 pounds each year; I know im getting older, but ive never been so overweight and i don't have a problem with overeating, but these past few years i have been hungrier than in the past and always want a carb of some kind), some purplish stretch marks and some spider veins (especially around the breasts) My periods have always been heavy since puberty.  Nothing unusual.  I am ovulating I know because I just found out Im pregnant with twins.  I have also been more susceptible to throat infections, sinus infections, bronchitis, yeast infections, and colds and stomach viruses in the past few years.   My question:  Is it possible that this cyst could be a benign tumor of the pituitary gland? Im really starting to think so because of everything unusual Ive been experiencing these past few years.  What else could cause these symptoms? Please don't say it's \" all in my head\".   Ive had tests done on my heart(MRA, echo, EKG's, nuclear stress testing, holter monitor: all normal) blood tests: HIV, hepatitis, lyme, ANA, rheumatoid factor, thyroid, liver, glucose blood test( but i have never had  a fasting glucose test) all normal; ct of chest: normal; chest x rays: normal.  My yearly physical last year was normal, which Im assuming many blood tests were done. I don't think ive been tested for anything else and so Im sure there are other possibilities but i really need to get to the bottom of things because now that im pregnant, im worried about complications i could have.  I do think I have diabetes, or at least pre-diabetes, but i don't think that's the extent of my problems or maybe it could be just that.  But what about the excessive body and facial hair??  Any input and advice would greatly be appreciated. thank you (from a happy pregnant soon to be mom of twins!!)\n\n",

    "title": "Re: cyst in sinus possible pituitary tumor??",
    "content": "Hi there  -  While you certainly do  have some symptoms which could  be consistent with a benign pituitary tumor -- and if you did the mass in your sinuses would have to be an awfully big coincidence or else a herniated tumor -- you could have more than one thing going on at the same time (the possibility of complex migraine can't be ruled out just yet,  but also could  be related so the theoritical tumor, too).   The potential for diabetes and a diabetes-related neuropathy must be ruled in or out as well as testing for cortisol and other associated levels to help determine whether or not the sinus mass is in fact a herniated benign pituitary tumor. If it is, the removal of the sinus mass might require a little more finesse than if it is simply a huge polyp or enlarged turbinate.   This is about the best I can do for you thus far. Additional testing prior to any sinus surgery,  as well as a glucose tolerance test (diabetes could be pre-existing or could be gestational if present at all) need to be done. Hopefully all this would help clarify things a  lot (and I strongly suspect the pituitary tumor theory based on your signs and symptoms). Hopefully this helps somewhat. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "My son was 19\" and 6 lbs at birth, and grew at a steady rate (albeit only at the 10th percentile) until he was about 7 months old. At that point he was 26\" long. He then stopped growing in height completely, and has only gained a few ounces each month since then.  He is now 11 months old, and still only 26\" long, and just this week reached 16 lbs for the first time. He is already about 3-4 inches behind his peers, and I don't want him to fall any further behind.  We have been to see the pediatrician, who said he was 'alarmed' at the lack of growth. My son is now completely below the curves shown on growth charts - his height is well below the 3rd percentile. The pediatrician called it a 'flatline'. My son's head circumference has been consistently at the 25th percentile, and he is functioning normally in every other way. He does not look 'sickly' or anything like that. He is perfectly proportionate, not too skinny.  We had a lengthy discussion regarding his feeding schedule, intake amounts of breastmilk, etc. He came up with the following recipe:  3 full meals a day of solid foods, then breastmilk afterwards (in addition to breastmilk feedings inbetween the meals). This is not much different than what we were doing - I just didn't offer him milk after the meals. He also asked me to take a daily multivitamin. We have implemented this new schedule, but he refuses the extra milk and is letting us know that he is full. He is not hungry.  I am afraid that this lack of growth is not related so much to nutrition as it is to familial short stature. My husband is 5'9\" with petite women in his family. However, I am only 4'8\".  I had a very similar experience as a baby, where I almost flatlined and then grew only about 3 inches between the time I was 6 months and 2 years old. To make matters worse, I grew at a slower rate (around 1/2\" to 1 1/2\" or so per year) until I reached my teens (then I stopped completely at age 14). As an adult I am in the 2nd percentile. I was of course checked for growth hormone deficiency and other problems, but was never diagnosed with any of them. I was told it was just in my DNA to be short.  So, I am just wondering if anyone in the endocrinology field has researched this type of 'flatline' growth in babies, if it points directly to a short stature adult height, and if there is anything at all I can do to reverse it. I know there are plenty of short statured people out there, but they normally follow their own growth curve. They don't just stop growing as babies like my son has. I feel that since he is already behind, I need to research anything I can to help him 'catch up'... or at least start growing again.  Can anyone help me please?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm 16 and a guy and under my left nipple is a hard, marble sized, lump.  I'm going to try and list any helpful information.  The nipple is also puffy and looks cracked.  Most of the time, when it is puffy, it protrudes outward from my chest very noticeably, but something cold touches it, the nipple shrivels up and looks more 'normal'.  I first noticed these lumps I think about two or three years ago.  Back then I had one under each nipple, but the right side has diminished almost completely.  I don't think I started noticing the puffyness until about a year ago.  The puffyness got noticeably worse recently.  I'm not sure if that has something to do with the fact that I started weight training.  I am skinny and athletic, not very much fat.  About 6 foot and 140lbs.  I think I started puberty later than others.  It took longer for my pubes to start growing and I'm just beginning to see underarm hair.    I'm a little confused on whats going on.  From what I've read, gynecomastia usually includes extra fat tissue around the breast, but I don't observe any of that on my body.  It's just the nipple lump and puffyness.  I want to know what it is, why it's there, and when it will go away but I haven't been able to find any answers.  Thanks for any help you can give.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: How do i know whether it is Type 1 or 2 diabetics?",
    "content": "Hello -  Type I diabetes is usually diagnosed early in life, no later than early adulthood and usually in childhood or adolescence. It is clinically different from Type II in that the pancreas is unable  to produce insulin (and so is always \"insulin dependent\" and treated with daily insulin replacement). This difference is determined by blood and urine testing as well as history. Since you're on the far side of young adulthood, it makes it a little bit difficult to be certain which type you may have, but it's probably Type I, as you no doubt would have become symptomatic long before now.   The FBG test finding of 140 would be diagnostic of diabetes,  assuming there were consecutive readings above 126 on different days. If you were diagnosed on the basis of just the one reading then you may not actually be diabetic. The number is high enough to be abnormal, and  probably does signify diabetes, but it's not extremely high, so doesn't set off the immediate bells and whistles that often are heard (figuratively only) when a patient walks in with BS of over 200-300.  Those higher numbers leave little doubt after one check. I hope this was not your only test result. It really needs to be confirmed, even though it's likely you are diabetic.  The cholesterol  reading was high overall, although you don't provide a breakdown of the four factors that make up that 220 number.   Both Type II diabetes,  if that's what you have (most likely),  and slightly elevated cholesterol, can be managed in many cases by diet and exercise. You're overweight for your height (even if you meant 178 cm. instead  of just 78, in which case you'd be  phenominally overweight), so starting a  weight loss program would be your first order of business to reduce BS and lipid levels, and this, along with a progressive exercise program (if you're not already on  one) would likely bring down these marginally high readings. With Type II diabetes the problem isn't so much what you eat (although of course all sugars isn't going to do any good at all), as what you take in and burn off in terms of calories. A healthy diet and healthy exercise practices generally will  bring these kinds of numbers into line. They are both fairly predictable given your height-to-weight ratio.   If you are determined to have Type I diabetes (unlikely, give the numbers, your age, etc.), then  you'd have to be put on insulin therapy indefinitely anyway, but you'd still help yourself a lot by losing the weight.    I  hope this answers your questions. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am sorry to hear about your continued problems. I really cannot think of a cause for your continued symptoms if your TSH is normal. However, I would advise you to consider discussing a full metabolic work up with your doctor. This would include simple tests such as a blood picture, blood sugar levels, renal and liver function tests. These 'screening' tests may direct us to a possible cause for your problems.  This of course depends on your doctors assessment. Your complaints are nonspecific - meaning they do not point towards a particular disease. Some of them are also very subjective which means they are felt more by the patient than they are appraised by the doctor. Subjective symptoms are always the most troublesome for both the patient and the doctor. However, something like involuntary weight gain can be objectively assessed and investigated.  Please keep us updated. Good luck and Happy New Year!\n\n",

    "title": "Retest after 4yrs: No PCOS/ IR, yet worsened symptoms remain",
    "content": "I was initially dx with PCOS & Insulin Resistance in 2004. My symptoms were: unexplained rapid weight gain (obesity), inability to lose weight, weight centralized in the abdominal region, irregular menstrual cycle, adult acne, HTN, hirsuitism. Labs were conducted by my OB/GYN and the dx was made by a Reproductive Endocrinologist. MY PCP ordered an pevlic sonogram which showed a few cysts in my left ovary. Since dx, I began excerising regularly and eating a low carb, sugar free diet while following the Glycemic Index. Additionally I began taking metforim 500mg, TID. I lost approximately 30lbs (although still considered obese) in 3 months. In late 2005, I became non-compliant to metformin and subsequently gained all weight back + 10 lbs. In Aug 2008, after accepting weight gain, and all aforementioned symptoms, worsened HTN & cholesterol, I visited a Reproductive Endocrinologist to again, begin treatment. I was re-tested and my labs were normal. No insulin resistance, no needed ratio of LH to FSH, no elevated testosterone levels. However in 2004, I was a textbook case of PCOS. It did show that my ALT level is now 53. I had an abdominal sonogram whose impression shows I have fatty liver.   Since, Spring 2007, I have been actively trying to lose weight through caloric and carbohydratic reduction with exercise, to no avail. I am rather confused as to how the PCOS and Insulin Resistance could have resolved itself as my symptoms are actually worse than before. I am again on the metformin (same dosage) due to now having the fatty liver. I am still continuing the same \"diet\" program  as I have been (no exercise) and has since lost 8lbs in the last 2 months. This is a huge feat because normally I would have to go to the extremes of anorexia and obsessive working-out in order to accomplish a pound.   Is there any medical explanation as to why my labs no longer show the necessary evidence to continue to dx me with Insulin Resistance or PCOS? Do I no longer have it although I still have all the symptoms?\n\n",

I take my HRT faithfully, and most of the  menopausal symptoms have been releived.  But I have chronic fatigue no matter how much sleep I get.  My skin has become really dry, my hair is falling out, I have diminished libido, irritability, difficulty concentrating or remembering things that happened 15 minutes ago.  I've always been very alert and focused, especially in my work, but I've noticed that other people in my office tend to make it a point to avoid me if they have a question or comment because I've become so scatter brained.  I went to my doctor a few months ago and had a thyroid scan done, and they said it came back normal.  But I've read several times that there are millions of women whose tests come back normal when they do, in fact have hypothyroidism.  I've considered trying a medication like Synthroid, but don't know what dosage I should start out at.  Any suggestions or input?  Thanks!!\n\n",

    "title": "subclinical hypothyroidism",
    "content": "Dear Stacy, I believe you are referring to a clinical entity described as subclinical hypothyroidism.  \"Subclinical\" Hypothyroidism (Compensated Hypothyroidism) describes a situation where the patient's Total and Free levels of thyroid hormone are normal, but the TSH is slightly elevated (5 to 15 mU/L). This may be viewed as a situation where a damaged thyroid gland is able to meet the needs of the body only with excess stimulation from the pituitary gland. These patients usually do not have symptoms of hypothyroidism and do not feel better after being treated. The thyroid gland is often normal to palpation but goiters may be present. Some patients will progress to overt hypothyroidism over time, particularly those with family histories of thyroiditis or with positive antibodies to thyroid tissue, as seen in Hashimoto Thyroiditis. Whether these patients should be treated before they develop overt hypothyroidism is not clear at the present time.  I reviewed your medical profile and understand that you do have a family history of thyroid disease (Grave's disease) which as you know would be associated with hyperthyroidism.   To rule out thyroid disease you should perform a TSH blood level test. Check to see if you have already done it. Hormone levels or the thyroid scan usually turn out normal in this particular case. If your TSH levels are normal you have excluded thyroid disease (both hyper and hypothyroidism).  Do not take Synthroid under any condition. You would only disrupt your whole body hormonal system.   Now back to your symptoms which again from reviewing your history appear to be more related to your depression than anything else. Please refer to your psychiatrist for a proper psychological evaluation.  Best regards,\n\n",

The only current medication I take is propecia 1mg qd. I am a 4th year medical student.  My question is simple.  I don't have medical insurance.  I exhibit a lot of the symptoms of hypothyroidism.  I have extreme cold intolerance so much so that even when everyone else around me feels hot, I still feel cold.  I always wear layered clothing.  I am constantly sleepy and tired even though I get around 8 hrs of sleep per day or more.  I have extremely dry skin (even after using moisturizing soap and lotion) and dry hair and dry scalp. My hair also falls out very easily but I think this is due more to androgenic alopecia. Still, hair on the back and sides of my head falls out too. The only thing I currently don't have is weight gain.  I am 6 feet 1 inch and I weigh 165 lbs. Also I am never constipated.  My question is, is there any harm in starting off on a small dose of synthroid and see if my symptoms improve or I start feeling better. I remember getting a TSH over a year ago, and it was in the normal range but more close to the high side. I don't remember the exact value and I don't have insurance to get another test.  I have access to synthroid.  What dose can I start on, what are the potential side effects and how long should I stick to it to see if symptoms improve.  Waiting for a response.  Thanks.\n\n",

Off and on last 7 years or so I have suffered severe irritability, menstrual irregularities (very heavy now and very short), loss of libido, hair loss (clumps in the shower),intolerance to cold, and about 6 mos ago I started getting cysts on my overies.  Finally went to an endo because I can not take the many symptoms anymore.  I also have a goiter.  All my bloodwork was normal except my DHEA and 24 hr. cortisol.  I was then given a dexamethasone suppression test which I have just found out lowered my cortisol to 0.something,  so negative for cushings.  The last 3 weeks new symptoms have come along...I have been waking up VERY amped up and jittery feeling like I am full of adrenaline or had 25 cups of coffee when I haven't, pounding heart (waking or shortly after resting hb 110), anxious energy, I wouldn't say dizzy but feel like my equilibrium is off, headache every day now for the last week or so.  The endo said high cortisol can not cause those symptoms, and to go to my PCP which I have an appointment with.  Any ideas what could cause these symptoms along with high cortisol?   I was also recently diagnosed with asthma (which I never had ?) after shortness of breath a couple times and given a weeks worth of prednisone (50 mg/day) just over a month ago.  I only took 3 days worth because the side effects were terrible (like current symptoms only much worse).  I may also be worth noting that the only 1mg of dexamethasone caused the same effects the other night (like current symptoms but times 50??)  If it lowered my cortisol by the morning what could make me feel like that through the course of the night?  Oh, and my bp over the last year has been low every time taken and I have always been a 120/80 type of gal.  No unusual stress in my life either?  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

    "content": "Hi,  Sorry for the delayed reply. I was wondering if you could explain what your endocrinologist thinks of your results. Generally we require at least two screening tests for elevated cortisol to make the diagnosis of Cushing's. In that sense the negative dexamethasone suppression test excludes Cushing's. DHEA can undergo periodic elevation physiologically. DHEA sulfate is more accurate and that is normal.  More importantly, your symptoms are not related to Cushing's disease. Cushing's usually presents with one or more of the following: hypertension (not hypotension), hyperglycemia, and weight gain.  Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "22 yr old female, currently on minocycline and birth control pills for acne, no other past medical problems:  currently experiencing fatigue that is not debilitating but is preventing me from doing some of the more difficult things I would normally do.  I am not sleepy, but am lethargic, weaker with low energy and stamina, slow, mentally foggy/forgetful/spacy/sluggish; it sometimes feels difficult to move, like my limbs are dead weight, and I am often stiff and sore-feeling, even though my exercise level/type hasn't changed much in 6 months.  My diet is good; I sleep well and for 8 hours; no other drugs (including alcohol) besides the above medications and sometimes ibuprofen; currently have minimal stress.  I walk 35-40 hrs per week, sometimes up and down hills, as part of my job; I have had this job 6 months.  I also get 1-2 hrs of light exercise and 1-2 hrs strenuous exercise per week.  This is the only lifestyle-related reason I can think of for the fatigue but I don't know what's normal.  I am also very sensitive to cold (have been for a while but it's getting worse) and had some mild depression a year ago (it's gone now and I was under a lot of stress at the time); but no other symptoms of hypothyroidism.  Should I see a doctor?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Even though you don't find the fatigue and  lassitude debilitating, it does seem to be bothering you enough that it would be worth a checkup. Some blood work, an office exam, rule out viral infections and a cursory neurological survey should expose anything out of the ordinary. If this gets more severe then definitely you should be seen. Sometimes a simple virus can play out as little more than fatigue and lethargy, but after six months it should have more than run its course. There is also the possibility of chronic fatigue  syndrome, which is pretty much a default diagnosis when everything else has been ruled out. It doesn't sound as though it is likely anything serious, but even a simple virus or mild anemia can make you feel less inclined to do the usual things.  There's also that history of depression. While  you may not feel depressed (sad, dislocated) now,  you still could be having some sort of sequal,  and depression (especially dysthymia) often presents as mild fatigue with some vague aches and pains, so it's really a differential diagnosis you're looking for.  I hope this helps. Best of luck to you, and please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Since you are on thyroid hormone replacement it is essential to be checked for the thyroid hormone level and the TSH (thyroid function tests) to make sure you are receiving the proper dose.  If you are shifting from a hypothyroid state to a hyperthyroid one this will make you lose more weight and also feel fatigue. Changes in the level of your hormone may result in disturbance in the body electrolytes like K, Ca levels which would make you get tired easily.   However, if you are starting the treatment, it is expected that there will be a transition period in which you may lose weight since hypothyroidism make you more towards weight gain and fat deposition.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor he might recheck your thyroid function tests as well as other tests accordingly. For drug interaction between your medications you better also consult your doctor.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I take meds for my bipolar and also I am hypothyroid so I guess I should've guessed that but my synthroid I thought was helping in that situation.  Guess not I am going to have to watch more of what I eat I feel when it comes to that.  More fiber as I have found that with hypothyroid plus being on meds for bipolar does not help.   I thank you so much for writing me back. I will keep you informed when the test results come back on my thyroid disorder.  I know you have alot of people that must be writing for help.  I am very much relieved after the x-ray of my stomach and also for the information you gave me on what the medication synthroid can do to you when it comes to losing weight  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am not an endocrinologist and this question should really be directed at your doctor but I will try to answer your question at least in part.  From my understanding during surgery aimed at removal of the pituitary (transsphenoidal hypophysectomy) 80-90% of the pituitary is removed, leaving a small island of tissue attached to the pituitary stalk.  From looking at the complication rate of this procedure many patients do not have long term hormonal deficiencies although low cortisol and low testosterone are the most common. Again, long term here means more than 12 months after the procedure. Some patients have transient diabetes insipidus which may be accompanied by transient deficiencies in anterior pituitary hormones such as TSH and GH.  I hope I have helped to partially answer your question. If you do come up with a more detailed explanation from your doctor please be sure to post here for everyone else!  Best wishes to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While the findings as quoted do sound counterintuitive, they could indicate a pituitary imbalance rather  than a thyroid problem. It is difficult to know with any certainty without the numbers, however, as they could be close enough to normal to not really indicate anything.   Are there any symptoms that  caused this  testing to be done? Would you happen to have access to the actual test results? That would really be helpful in trying to figure out what they mean, although if the doctor is unconcerned, it seems likely they are just out of range.   Let us know if you can come up with the actual numbers and we can see if there is any cause for concern or if it's all relatively normal.\n\n",

I tried dieting and exercising but it didn't work. And also I don't eat too much compared to my friends of my age. 3.  I am forgetting things very easily. It's affecting my studies a lot. 4.  I am facing some digestion problems. Never before I have experienced any problems in digestion. And now even if I eat very less I feel full stomach. 5.  I feel a bit of pain in my chest region sometimes (I fell very tight in my chest). And my breathing seems to be very slow (I need to breath forcefully) 6.  Apart from these I have also noticed that I am not growing in height, my hands seems not to be proportional to the rest of my body.  For your information my mother is having hypothyroidism. Can I have hyperthyroidism at teenage?   Please guide me and I would be very grateful to you all if you tell me, if I am having Hypothyroidism. Lots of thanks in advance.

    "content": "Hello -  While you've used hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism alternately in your  post, what you describe does  sound as though it might  be hypothyroidism. The loss of hair, unintentional weight gain and diminished memory capacity all would strongly support at least a test for thyroid problems. The chest tightness and difficult respirations sound more like asthma, but there's no rule that you can't have both things going on at the same time.   A comprehensive physical exam with emphasis on thyroid panel test and perhaps a simple pulmonary function test could  help clear up any questions about this. Thyroid problems often tend to run in families, so there is the family history as well. I'd definitely explore  this with at least your family physician.  I hope this  helps answer your question. Best of luck to you. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

I just wanted to make sure we were both talking about the same thing, as they are rather polar opposites and either one can turn up in a subsequent generation. Thanks for clarifying.  While medication is the primary consideration in managing hypothyroidism, it never hurts and can only help to live healthy. That means that regular exercise and good nutrition can play a role in not only your overall health, but in maximizing the benefits of the thyroid replacement medication. While this is important to all of us, it's especially important to people with certain medical conditions, and this is one that can really benefit from fine-tuning one's lifestyle.

    "content": "Hello -  Topical testosterone gel can have serious side effects if used by women, and it is strongly advised that women not use it. For men it can have occasional, mainly annoying side effects, but this is by no means universal. If you have any painful inflammation of the skin where it is applied, you should stop the application and consult your doctor, but these reactions a relatively rare. The potential for cancer becomes a slight risk with men age 65 and over, but otherwise does not appear to be an issue. You are an ideal candidate, given your age, health, etc.  This should be fine. Again, if any irritation of the skin or other allergic-type reactions should take place, although unlikely, only then should you stop the application of the gel and let your doctor know about the problem. Usually the dosing would be adjusted to compensate for this.  I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

My tongue was always a little swollen in the mornings after eating a lot(visible teeth indentations on the sides of tongue) But today I have had a tongue so swollen that it created a lisp when I spoke. The swelling went down but returned again in a 8 hour period. Swollen only on one side with pain and discomfort when I swallow. I am also taking antibiotics for a bladder infection as well as dealing with lowering my lexapro dosage. I took an antibio yesterday and I had abdominal cramping accompanied with diarrhea. Stopped taking it then went to doctor he prescribed another one. The swelling happened in between the antibiotics, 8 hours after first bad antibio and 4 hours before new antibio. Could be completely unrelated. I told doctor about it, he offered no explanation or concern. I assume that it is not serious then. Then again, it was a discount doctor....(free clinic i am poor)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  A swollen tongue isn't normal, and if it produces symptoms it is worthy of some concern. If it's resolved by now, maybe it's ok, but if it happens again, please have it looked at right away. This can be (and usually is) either an allergic response to something (could easily have been the first antibiotic you were taking, and allergic reactions don't always happen with the first dose, so that doens't matter); it also could be angioneurotic edema, which is probably usually an allergic reaction as well, but often is not traceable to the triggering agent. In either case the problem can be serious, so if it does happen again, please call a doctor or go to an urgent care facility or emergency room. It's never something one can afford to just ignore.   I hope this is helpful and that by now everything is back to normal. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

Also, I went to a dermatologist who believes my thick skin, with discolored velvety build-up, acne, yellow skin, and patches of white spots are symptoms of unbalanced thyroid levels. I was also recently diagnosed with a memory disability.  I've had these skin and memory issues since before I was nine years old. I've also had symptoms of depression and lethargy since the same time. Just recently my throat has begun to ache consistently for the last month. Is it possible that I've had hypothyroidism since I was young, or are these symptoms unrelated? Looking only at information on the internet, I also seem to have auxiliary symptoms of hypothyroidism, but I'm wary of information on the internet. My doctor believes that I'm just now experiencing Hashimoto's Hypothyroidism as my thyroid is abnormally large, but I'm disconcerted by what I've read about hypothyroidism recently.  I'm 19 years old, 5'5'', at 130 pounds.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: Skin Symptons, Sudden Throat Pain",
    "content": "Hello,  Your symptoms as well as the test results are suggestive of hypothyroidism mostly due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease in which the body immune cells attack cells of the thyroid. This is a common cause of thyroid hypofunction.  However, during the acute phase of the disease, thyroid hormones being released from the damaged thyroid gland result in an initial state of hyperthyroidism. So patients may present earlier with thyroid gland enlargement make them feel throat tightness and swallowing difficulty.  Patient then go into a phase of thyroid hypofunction, so patients may complain of fatigue, depression, difficulty in concentration, have dry skin and excessive sleepiness.  Diagnosis based on complete history, physical examination and investigations for exclusion of other causes of nodular goiter (benign or malignant).   Essential blood tests are thyroid function tests: T3, T4 and TSH.  Typically, there should be elevated TSH and low T3 and T4 (may be normal or high initially, as in your case).  Diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is helped by the finidng of thyroid autoantibodies. Which are high in your blood test results.  Thyroid US and scan are recommended as needed, and US is also used to guide a FNAC.  Histological studying of the thyroid tissue may be needed and diffuse infiltration of the thyroid gland with inflammatory cells is characteristic for Hashimoto thyroiditis.   Treatment is usually medical with hormone replacement according to symptoms and lab results. While surgery is kept for complicated cases.  Whether this was the cause of your early symptoms years before the diagnosis is made is a difficult question to be answered. But there are cases of chronic thyroiditis that may have subclinical hypothyroidism with constantly elevated TPO antibody.  Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody is used to detect antibodies against the thyroid gland in conditions similar to Hashimoto's Thryoiditis. Most people with chronic thyroiditis (70%-90%) are positive for TPOAB test.   In any circumstances what is known is that serial follow up testing to keep your thyroid hormone level within the normal range (with replacement therapy when needed) would improve your symptoms.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and please keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While your ferritin level is toward the low end of normal (and so you are more likely to be lower in iron than you may need to be), your TSH is significantly elevated, and strongly indicative of hypothyroidism. Since the symptoms of hypothyroidism are more clearly defined than relative iron defeciency anemia (IDA), it seems extremely likely your hypothyroidism is responsible for the symptoms you describe, and that you would probably see a marked improvement once placed on  thyroid replacement therapy. After that is accomplished, your iron levels could be retested and, if necessary, fine-tuned. I have very little doubt, however, that the symptoms are primarily due to low thyroxin levels.  Synthroid or some generic equivalent should probably be instituted at an appropriate level soon.   I hope this is helpful. Please  follow up with us.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The endocrinolgist should be your central doctor right now so far as this problem is concerned. The results aren't normal. You would seem to be hypoglygemic, which can happen even in the setting of normal insulin levels, as much depends  upon how one's insuling receptors  work. (This  result is sometimes seen as a pre-diabetic metabolic finding, but often it simply means you're hypoglygemic). You've lost weight the way someone with new-onset diabetes would, but I've also known this to happen in hypoglycemics as well, so it's not completely telling.  You should be followed by an endocrinologist, coordinated with an internist. I'm not sure what five doctors you're seeing now, or what other health issues you may have, but the abnormal GTT would seem to coordinate with your symptoms.  Hopefully this can be medically managed fairly simply.  I hope this helps. Best of luck to you,  and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

So goto doctor and they do general blood work and allergy blood work. 12/21/2007 Glucose-92 urea-16 creatinine-0.86 bun/creatinine ratio-19 sodium-139 potassium-4.3 chloride-104 carbon dioxide-23 calcium-9.4 protein-7.2 albumin-4.5 Globulin-2.7 albumin/glo ration-1.7 bilirubin-0.7 alkaline phosphatase-74 ast-21 alt-27  cbc white blood cell-6.4 red-4.92 hemoglobin-15.4 hematocrit-45.2 mcv-91.9 mch-31.3 mchc-34.1 rdw-12.8 platelet count-212 neutrophils-3475 lymphocytes-1901 monocytes-659 eosinophils-346 basophils-19 neu 54.3% lym 29.7% mono 10.3% eosin 5.4% baso 0.3% h. pylori igg antibody-0.4   Doctor told me I took too much allergy medicine and I needed to diet. So I went to an allergist. Pin test and my whole bad turned red in about 4 minutes. I have been getting allergy shots for 5 months now 3 shots every tues and Friday.  So did this for a while. Tried to diet, kept gaining weight. Stopped taking allergy medicine.  Everything kept getting worse. This caused some marital issues so we were taking marriage counseling. Lady told me I had ADD. So she game me VyVanse 30mg. The first time I took it, my allergies went away. Completely! And it gave me energy back. But didn't help with  anything else. Went to 50mg. Same, 70mg, same. Then she put me on 140 mg. 70Mg twice a day. Still didn't do anything. And expensive. So put me on adderral 60mg 15 mg 4 times a day. Same thing. While I was on it completely allergy free, it was wonderful. Then she told me I have too  much stress, and somewhat depressed. So I went to see a therapist. He told me I handle stress well, and didn't seem like I was depressed. But told me to go get my Testosterone checked cause of my lack of libido. So I go and get my testosterone checked. Also while on Vyvanse/adderal. I got back down to 155lbs I was still eating a fair amount.  05/21/08 Testosterone total 210ng/dl range between 250-1100 tsh, 3rd generation 0.95mIU/L  So i've got low Testosterone she runs more blood work  6/23/08 Testosterone total- 255 Testosterone free- 75.7 Testosterone free% 2.97%  range should be 1.5-2.2% Estradiol 42pg/mL  PTH, intact and calcium    Parathyroid hormone 23 Calcium 9.7  then she tells me since my total is above 250 now I'm ok So I went to a different doctor because these people are so slow and non-caring  different doctor sends me to an endocrinologist, he does more blood work.   10/02/2008 Glucose-89 urea-20 creatinine-0.75 bun/creatinine ratio-n/a sodium-142 potassium-4.6 chloride-104 carbon dioxide-25 calcium-8.9 protein-7.1 albumin-4.5 Globulin-2.7 albumin/glo ration-1.6 bilirubin-0.3 alkaline phosphatase-758 ast-15 alt-15  cbc white blood cell-6.6 red-4.48 hemoglobin-13.8 hematocrit-40.8 mcv-91.2 mch-30.9 mchc-33.9 rdw-12.5 platelet count-162 neutrophils-4013 lymphocytes-1782 monocytes-521 eosinophils-251 basophils-33 neu 60.8% lym 27% mono7.9% eosin 3.8% baso 0.5%   DHEA Sulfate 203 FSH 1.6 LH 3.6 Prolactin 6.5 t-4, free 1.1 tsh, 3rd generation 1.86 Testosterone total 359 testosterone free 96.2 testosterone free  2.68%  And then he told me. Nothing is wrong is me, I need to Diet. Because I had stopped taking the Vyvanse/adderall (sometime mid July)  because it wasn't doing anything I have gained weight and I'm now back up to 192lbs which I gained back between 1st of July and November. My allergies have also come back full tilt and allergy shots still haven't been doing a lot for me. Since last December I've had more symptoms, and worsing of others.  Heartburn is starting to come back with the weight gain.   My eye sight is getting worse, I got glass over a year ago and now these aren't helping any. And at times my vision just goes completely blurry and I have to close my eyes, or blink a couple of times to see clear again.  Lack of libido is now, no libido.  Extremely tired all the time  Been forgetting words, how to make numbers on a constant basis. Words don't make sense to me  Become very irritable towards everyone.  Stuff that I never had to think about now is hard, like shaving I have to think how to shave when I used to just do it without thinking.  Used to be a heavy sleeper, now I'm a very very light sleeper, the cat sneezing wakes me up.   So this is where I'm at. And would like some input as to if I'm just going crazy, or is something actually wrong with me? Thanks in advanced. And sorry for the spelling and grammar issues.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  So your labs and exams have for the most come back pretty normal. You've responded well, allergy-wise, to Vynase and Adderal. You have significant weight  gain, loss of libido, low energy, some perception of impaired mentation, visual disturbances and irritability.  Have you seen a neurologist? While the overall picture would have suggested an endocrine problem at first, that now seems as though it may be either coincidental or possibly non-existent. It isn't accounting for the major symptoms, if one sets aside, for the moment, the weight problem.   If one separates out the endocrinological possibilities from the neurological ones, it seems there is an equal chance you have a neurological problem -- MS comes to mind -- and that this should be ruled out while a comprehensive neurological workup is performed. There's no rule that you can't have more than one problem at a time. There are some pieces of the puzzle that do sound like they could be neurological rather than some other system.   Beyond that I'd have to say this stumps me. If there's no neurological problem then there's something really obscure going on, but I really feel there's a possibility that this is at least partly neurological and that should be looked at  carefully. If nothing turns up there, then back to the endocrinologist.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Hypokalemia can be caused by potassium K loss, K shift into the intracellualr space, or less commonly due to inadequate intake. This is a concerning situation and prompt management is essential.  One of the main causes of K shift into the inside of cells is changes in the level of different hormones like insulin, catecholamine and thyroid hormone.  Acid-base and electrolyte imbalance seen with thyroid hyperfunction is common than thought and is a treatable condition that if passed unnoticed may be critical. Hypokalemia associated with hypophosphaturia, and hypercalciuria have been reported in hyperthyroid patients.  Immediate therapy with potassium chloride supplementation as well as definite control of hyperthyroidism is mandatory.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him your concerns he might re-evaluate your thyroid function tests and adjust the dose of thyroxin therapy.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I still believe that the high level of your thyroid hormones is the most likely cause and there will be no effective therapy to make your K level back to normal without correcting the thyroid problem.  I would advise you also to inform your doctor about the swelling you felt recently, direct clinical examination is essential to diagnose any lump.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I'm so far overweight its just unbelievable to me. I try to be as healthy as possible, and as active as i can, but the weight will not go away.   I don't know if this has anything to do with it but, a few years back i was diagnosed with mild depression.

    "content": "Let us review some common factors associated with weight gain.  Age - At your age, many of them tend to gain weight. It could be reversible or irreversible.  Increase in caloric intake and Alcohol- Knowingly or unknowingly, one tends to eat more. Alcohol can also cause weight gain.  Decrease in physical activity level- Which doesn't seem to be an issue in your situation.  Medications:-  Steroids can cause variable weight gain  Antidiabetic medications are associated with weight gain.  Antidepressants- Many of the antidepressants medications are associated with weight gain.  Oral contraceptives are associated with wieght gain.  Depression and stress themselves are associated with increase food intake, knowingly or unknowingly.  Just to list some Endocrinologic disorders:-  Cushing syndrome Hypothyroidism Polycystic ovary syndrome Hypogonadism  So to sum it up, weight gain could be due to a single or multiple factors. Last but not the least, having positive attitude towards life always helps. I tried to give you a rough idea but you need to see your doctor and the dietician regarding this. I am sure you will see positive results with time and proper counselling.  Wish you best luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Lethargy, hair loss, hirsutism and puzzled",
    "content": "First of all, I apologize, my post is a bit long! I will try to be as clear as possible...  I've always been a very tired girl, even when I was a kid, I always had extreme trouble to wake up in the morning.  I have had phases in my life where I'd get extremely tired, to the point where I had to stop going to school / stop working completely.  I'd also lose hair, gain weight and get a very low sex drive.  Those phases started around 14 years old.  Almost every episode fits with me trying to use birth control pills or depo-provera, but this might be just a coincidence.  However, I have never been able to take BCP for more than 2 months because I throw them up (systematically, and quite violently).  That being said, I seem to be now stuck in one of those 'lethargic' phases, except that it's now been close to 2 years and I'm getting new symptoms / the old symptoms are getting worst.  Prior to this, I was overweight but not obese, at 80kgs.  I am now 100kgs.  I gained most of the weight within the last year.  1 - I am extremely tired.  I have a hard time waking up, I am sleepy and lethargic during the day, and I barely have enough energy to go back home at night.  Sleep apnea has been ruled out.  2 - I am losing hair, a bunch of it, all over the head and there are now spots on my legs that are hairless.  3 - Hairs are growing on my chin and recently, on my breasts.  4 - My menstrual cycle went from 30 days to 45-50, with extremely heavy flow.  I have severe mood swings during the first day of my period.  Most of my symptoms get worse during that time too.  5 - If I get sick (like a cold), I'll be sick for much longer than any of my collegues, and I will be lethargic for the next couple weeks after that.  6 - I have a few dark spots on my chin as if my skin was dirty, I also have one spot on my right knee.  They've been there for quite some time, I don't think I'm getting new ones, but these ones aren't disappearing.  7 - I recently started having puss-filled cysts in my armpits / genital area, worst when I have my period.  8 - I tend to feel dizzy when I shower, I have to lay my back on the wall to avoid falling.  9 - Most doctors I go to systematically test me for anemia because my face is so pale, I usually look like a ghost.  10 - I am driving everyone at work nuts because I tend to get cold easily and I need to be in a very hot environment to start feeling well again, so I turn the heat up while they're not looking...  11 - I do take a lot of caffeine in a day, probably more than average people but not excessive.  I have severe withdrawal effects if I don't take anything caffeinated beverage for more than 24 hours (mostly headache, bad fatigue and nausea).  In addition to that, I noticed that I am also more prone to UTIs during that time.  I've taken a lot of antibiotics in the past for diverse infections, and I now can't take levaquin because it makes me semi-comatose/unresponsive and gives me severe shoulder pain, go figure.  Last time I took cipro for an infection, I disappeared from the face of the earth for a full week, I wouldn't even wake up to pick up the phone, not fun.  I had a few tests done here and there, but since I am not in my home country, it's a bit complicated to see doctors, and I am starting to be somewhat worried about the fact that I'm getting new symptoms and the old ones are getting worse every day.  I would greatly appreciate any input/advice as to what to look into next.  Here are some of my test results :   Fasting blood glucose (taken every day for a week) has been steady around 80-86 Non-fasting (1 week) varied between 110-119, with a mean of 112.  Echography shows functional cyst on right ovary, enlarged ovaries but PCOS has been ruled out.  Sleep apnea has been ruled out.  Free Testosterone : 0,016pg/ml (0,8-10) DELTA 4 ANDROSTENEDIONE 4,8 ng/ml (0,70 - 3,50) FSH 3,7mUI/ml (4-12) LH 7,08mUI/ml (2-8) OESTRADIOL 44pg/ml (18-147) SDHA 3,85ug/ml (0,35-4,25) TESTOSTERONE 0,75ng/ml SEX BINDING GLOBULINE 22,4nmol/l TSH 1,26 (0,25 - 5)    Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 34 yr old female who has insulin resistance.  It was diagnosed in 2002.  My endo currently has me on Metformin 2 x daily (850mg each), I have lost approx. 30-40 lbs while on the Metformin.  I have always been extremely active but the only way I have seen weight loss results is by taking this med.  I exercise 6 days a week for approx. 1 1/2 hr. From high intensity step classes, kickboxing and spinning classes.  Suddenly my weight loss has stopped, my endo ran tests and it all came back normal.  My question is the following, I currently came accross many articles on cinnamon and it's benefits on insulin resistance and diabetes type 2.  It seems to help lower blood sugar and help significantly with insulin resistance.  However I read that if taking any type of diabetic medications one must be very caustious to use the cinnamon or non at all because the 2 can have a serious affect, one being a dramatic drop in blood sugar, is this correct?  I am currently checking with my own Endo but wanted to hear from other experts in the field.  I would like to begin drinking a tea using cinnamon a least 2 times daily.  Thank you very much for this great service and God bless. :)\n\n",

You can take cinnamon along with metformin. Metformin by itself doesn't lower blood sugar. It reduces insulin resistance, which means it increases peripheral uptake of glucose and decreases excess glucose release from liver which is the basic pathology in insulin resistance.  Your basic aim should be - not letting blood glucose shoot above normal limits.  Exercise Diet planning Metformin  do help in insulin resistance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I am a male of 26 years of age and suffering from low testosterone. Due to which I had erection problem and other low testosterone symptoms. My urologist prescribed me clomid (25mg a day) for 2 months. I recovered a lot in that 2 months but then by the end of the second month I again started having problems with my sexual arousal and I started gaining weight and fat particularly at abdomen. My blood work showed that testosterone had risen but even estradiol had risen, which made  my T/E ratio to 11:1.  Seeing this my urologist stopped clomid and prescribed me with arimidex for a month (1mg tablet, one daily). At the end of the month my T/E ratio was 40:1 and I felt great in all aspects. My sexual response and sensitivity to arousal had increased. I could feel weight loss and felt more energetic.  But my insurance is not willing to cover arimidex (they say it is a medicine for females for breast cancer), and I can not afford to buy it on my own. I was thinking to suggest my urologist to prescribe me dosage combining clomid and arimidex, so that I don't end up paying for 30 day supply of arimidex.  Is anyone tried, the combinaton of clomid and arimidex, if yes what would be the optimal dosage? Since now my solution is to balance, rather decrease estradiol (which is formed by aromatase enzymes), can anyone suggest me any cheaper option for aromatase inhibition?  Thanx\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Causes of increase calcium in urine (hypercalciuria) and calcium stone formation include increased intestinal absorption of calcium, excessive level of certain hormones like parathyroid hormone and vitamin D or excess renal calcium loss due to defect in the kidney.   -The thyroid hormone itself has an effect on increasing renal excretion of calcium thus may promote calcium stone formation especially if you do not take enough fluids. 20% of patients with hyperthyroidism have high blood calcium level.  -High blood sugar and insulin release is known to increase the excretion of calcium thus may also promote calcium stone formation.  -Excess intake or absorption of oxalates may result also in precipitation of calcium in urine and the formation of calcium oxalate crystals and stones.  So investigations would include 24 hours urine analysis (calcium, phosphate, urate, and oxalate levels), kidney function tests, parathyroid hormone, thyroid function tests and vitamin D level,  serum calcium level as well as blood sugar.  This will provide an idea about the likely cause. Since the parathyroid hormone was at a normal level, other causes should be checked out.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor he might recommend repeating the blood and urine tests as well as consultation of an endocrinologist.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I also had slightly elevated ACE and just over the upper parameter for calcium in urine but these 2 things normalised after Prednisone.

Whereas my fasting used to be around 80, it's now 140 and my (2 hour after meals) reading is running around or above 200.

    "content": "Hello,  The most common cause of splenic cyst is posttraumatic cysts. Misdiagnosed traumas to the spleen result in intrasplenic hematoma or laceration that is seen by scan as cysts. Difficult colonoscopy for example has been reported to cause splenic trauma and hematomoas.   Other cysts that are not uncommon include inflmmatory spelnic abcess and pancreat pseudocysts. Whether these cysts affected the pancreatic function and insulin release or not is uncertain and is difficult to tell.  These cysts rarely become malignant.  Neoplastic cysts in the spleen are not common and include cavernous hemangioma (benign), lymphoma, angiosarcoma and metastases (malignant).  Management depends on the nature of this mass and its effect.  I would advise you to follow up with your physician.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated.

    "title": "BHRT in perimenopausal women",
    "content": "I have several questions regarding BHRT:  I am perimenopausal, and had an endometrial ablation procedure in 12/07 due to severe menorrhagia.  With that issue resolved and a clean bill of health, I began supplementing about 6 mos. ago with a (7-day) 0.075 mg/day estradiol patch, and 100 mg/day of compounded bio-identical progesterone cream to treat my ongoing hot flashes, brain fog, etc.    At this point, my estradiol levels are staying fairly consistent in the 50-55 pg/mL range; and my serum progesterone values are in the 1.3-1.7 ng/mL range with this supplementation.    For the progesterone, there seems to be no standard range to compare with, so how can I tell if I am getting too much, too little, or just enough, especially if I am asymptomatic at this time?    And as far as the estradiol, what would be considered the optimal serum value for a perimenopausal or menopausal woman who is supplementing?  I am finding much conflicting information on the range that best delivers optimal bone and cardiovascular benefits, so it is hard to know if I should increase my dosage until I reach the range I am reading about (70-100 ng/mL), or if I should remain status quo for the time being?  I feel good at this dosage (no more hot flashes, brain fog, or lethargy).  But, if I am still not at optimal range for keeping my bones, heart and brain healthy, I'd certainly be open to increasing the dosage as long as my body can tolerate it.  I also cannot seem to find anything definitive on whether or not it's even necessary to use bio-identical progesterone every day, or if applying it for only 2 weeks or a few days out of the month, or at even longer intervals would still offer adequate endometrial and breast protection.  I am concerned about overloading my body with something that I may only need very small quantities of for optimal benefits.  And, unfortunately, I am currently in an HMO that has no physicians who are knowledgeable or might embrace BHRT, so I am pretty much on my own with my library of books, and the NP who prescribes for me.  Thank you for any answers you can offer, or any reference material that might address these concerns.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Since your symptoms are resolved with the current physician prescribed dose, there is no need to consider it as inadequate and increase the dose. Moreover, you should not change the prescribed medication dose or frequency without referral to your doctor.  Levels of estradiol and progesterone should be compared to the normal lab ranges.   What I would also advise you to do is to discuss with your doctor assessing your risk for developing breast cancer. Your previous history of breast biopsy, and being on HRT at this age would make you at higher risk and regular screening is beneficial.  Studies about hormone replacement therapy have been so conflicting. The cumulative (over years) absolute risk of breast cancer for women aged 40-79 falls with increasing age. Those who are on estrogens only hormone replacement or short term (less than five years) use of combined therapy aged 50 years or more, are not exposed to significant elevation in their cumulative absolute risk for breast cancer.   But studies showed also an additional cancer risk for those who continued to take hormone replacement therapy for long periods (more than 5 years) and those received the combined form (estrogen and progesterone).   Breast self examination, annual clinical examination and mammography are recommended for women on HRT.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The administration of corticosteroids was reported to cause suppression on thyroid function directly or indirectly in different studies.  This effect is known to be transient and the normal thyroid function is expected to be gradually regained after steroid withdrawal.  Thyroid hypofunction is treated with thyroid hormone replacement.  Thyroid-stimulating hormone TSH Normal range is 0.4\u20134.5mIU/L. Thyroid hyperfunction is diagnosed by testing for: -Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a low level of TSH means the thyroid gland is overactive and is making too much thyroxine. - Thyroxine (T4), a high level of T4 confirms hyperthyroidism.  Borderline results are defined by a normal T4 with a low TSH. In this case, another blood test for another thyroid hormone named T3 is helpful.    A way to confirm is to repeat the tests a few weeks later, as sometimes borderline tests are caused by another illness. When TSH is lower than 0.1 mIU/L, repeating the measurement of TSH, as well as Free T4 and a total T3 or Free T3, within 4 weeks of the initial measurement or within a shorter interval if there are signs or symptoms of hyperthyroidism.  Other tests like Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland may show a nodule (or nodules) in the thyroid and a thyroid scan is done as needed.   Borderline hyperthyroidism is seen postviral infection and postpartum. Thyroid dysfunction is more common on those who have previous thyroid dysfunction or autoimmune diseases.  Subclinical hyperthyroidism due to destructive thyroiditis including postviral subacute thyroiditis usually resolves spontaneously. Treatment is usually initiated when concerning symptoms or signs are present.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him all your concerns.

    "content": "Hello -  Hypothyroidism and elevated cholesterol most definitely can be (and often are) associated. Treatment for hypothyroid won't necessarily, however, resolve the cholesterol problem, and your numbers are entirely too high, even if you were premenopausal. That you're not just makes correcting this all the more important. Your doctor is just wrong, there's no way to make that look better. Your total cholesterol is too high (doctors like to see it at or below 200), and your LDL is far too high (the acceptable number used to be 130, but now is lower, and 100 is ideal for someone with no history of heart disease). The fact that your father has elevated cholesterol only makes this more of a problem, since high cholesterol often runs in families, as do thyroid abnormalities (not always the same ones, either).   Since you're eating properly and you exercise regularly, it's pretty clear you have pathologically high cholesterol and very probably should be put on a statin drug to get those numbers down to a more healthy range. Contrary to the old canard,  women can, and do, develop coronary artery disease. You're menopausal, too, so you lack the protection you might otherwise have. If your doctor feels this is of no consequence you need to find another doctor, at least for management of this  problem.   Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Good afternoon!  I have been struggling with thyroid symptoms for the last 7 years.  My initial test results were a TSH level of 1.3 (no T3 or T4 tests were run at that time).  This March, my TSH levels were at 0.58, and I requested a visit to an endocrinologist.  Everyone on my mother's side has hyperthyroidism despite always testing within the normal ranges - they are all either on medication or have had surgery to remove the thyroid.  By the time I got to see the endocrinologist, I was 15 weeks pregnant.  I was diagnosed by an endocrinologist with hyperthyroidism during week 15 of my pregnancy  (TSH <0.01, T3 (total) 2.7, T4, free 1.24).  I was put on 50 mg of PTU 3 times/day (150 mg total/day).  I began taking the medication just over 1 month ago and noticed an almost immediate improvement in my symptoms.  Although my OB initially agreed that I should take the medication, he has since determined that I cannot be hyperthyroid because it \"cannot be diagnosed during pregnancy.\"  He wants me to stop taking the PTU immediately and ignore the endocrinologist.  I cannot get my OB and endocrinologist to talk to one another and have been left to research the condition and its relationship to pregnancy on my own.    Can you help me answer the following questions: 1. Can hyperthyroidism be diagnosed during the second trimester of pregnancy? 2. Was a diagnosis of mild hyperthyroidism possible in my case? 3. Is medication prudent in my case, given the risks of uncontrolled hyperthyroidism during pregnancy?  I appreciate any help you are able to give me, and I have other lab results you may be interested in seeing that I am more than happy to share.   My sincere regards and thanks,  Julia\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hyperthyroidism Diagnosis During Pregnancy",
    "content": "Hello,  Women of childbearing age are quite prone to thyroid disorders so if it was not diagnosed prior to pregnancy, it seems logical it could occur even after and it is frequently diagnosed in pregnancy.  However, treatment options in pregnancy are limited since the most commonly used medications are not considered safe.  Surgery is sometimes necessary if treatment is indicated during pregnancy but of course this is not without risk to the baby.    This may be the reason your doctor recommends that you not take the medication.  If the doctor feels yours is a mild case, it may be the best option. But, it is important that you have a relationship of trust with your doctor so if this is not working, perhaps a second opinion is in order.  I would think the two types of doctors would welcome an exchange to discuss your condition but you would likely need to release them to disclose information first.    It is safe to take the medications during breastfeeding, in case you are wondering about that.  Usually, drugs such as propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole (MMI) are used and these can be started after delivery if needed.  I can't overemphasize the importance of the doctor patient relationship so if you are more comfortable you can change providers.  Meanwhile, perhaps you should talk with your endocrinologist even if the doctors aren't talking together.  Maybe there is more to the picture here.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your doctor is right that synthroid does not cause hair loss and that the package insert does have to list every reported symptom (whether or not it was caused by the drug).   The reason someone would experience the loss is because of the delayed response of hair growth to the hypothyroid condition.  Hair grows very slowly and so loss continues for perhaps six months after the thyroid hormone is replaced.    The B vitamins as well as vitamin A, C, and Biotin can sometimes also affect hair so it's good to have a good supplement when experiencing hair growth concerns.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "High normal to slightly elevated serum calcium for 35 years",
    "content": "When I was 20, way back in 1973, a doctor told me I had a slightly elevated blood calcium level and that in the future I should be checked for possible parathyroid disease.  No other doctor mentioned the calcium level until I was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2002.  I had started experiencing very great fatigue and my hematologist/oncologist assured me that was not a normal symptom of CLL.  My primary care doctor worked with me to rule out any of my medications as a cause.  We discovered the hypothyroidism and started synthroid.  My CLL specialist noticed the slightly elevated calcium but ruled that out as a cause of my fatigue because he said it would have to be moderately to greatly elevated before it would cause me fatigue.  We treated the CLL because there were other bothersome symptoms.  None of the things that I've tried with either doctor has alleviated my fatigue, and my blood calcium continues to test high normal to slightly high each time.  Could I possibly have hyperparathyroidism indicated by the calcium levels and could I have had it for 35 years?  If not, do some people just naturally have a higher normal blood calcium level?  If so, would it suddenly start causing me fatigue for some reason?  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It is entirely possible you could have been sufffering from some degree of hyperparathyroidism for all this time. While the serum calcium concentrations seem not to be sufficient to be causing the fatigue, the CLL certainly could account for that, but hyperparathyroidism should also be taken into consideration even though the calcium levels arent that high.   Hyperparathydoidism is often overlooked, and the symptoms are quite often so minimal to non-existent that there is no impetus to look further. Now that you know about it, it may be worth another look. I don't think the calcium elevation is the cause of your fatigue, however, while CLL seems a pretty likely culprit even though it is otherwise being managed well.  I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "My mother had a pituitary tumor removed about a year ago.  She previously had undergone radiation to shrink the tumor, as she didn't want to face a second surgery (1st time was several years ago--partially removed through nose). The surgeon commented that the radiation had caused part of the tumor to stick to her optic nerve, and as a result, she has poor peripheral vision.  He is fairly confident they removed all the tumor.  But ever since the surgery, my mom has had such a poor quality of life.  She is only 64.  Now on a daily basis, she suffers from the following:  Excessive urination (avoids going places is she's not sure where their bathrooms are)... even at night (poor sleep as a result).  Dry skin Swelling of hands and feet/ joint pain in hands and wrist/several fingers have become numb Feet have begun to hurt (says shoes don't seem to fit right anymore) Extreme fatigue/lethargy -will fall asleep if sitting too long. Absent mindedness.  My mom sees an endocronoligist, but Diabetes inspidus hasn't been mentioned to my knowledge.  She takes the following: Levothyroxine and hydrocortisone, and Avalide 300 for blood pressure. My mom rarely gives her doctor the full picture, and she doesn't want my dad going in with her to see the doctor (for reasons I'll not discuss).   Is it possible the doctors are missing something?  Could it be Diabetes Insipidus? What kind of advice should I give her?  I  live 3 hours away from her with a family of my own, and I can't always go with her to the doctor.  But I worry constantly about her.  She seems to never feel good.\n\n",

The results were TSH of 38.31 and T4 of 5.4, so my OB gave my Thyroxine to take for 2 weeks and then repeat the tests. He said he is not very fmaliar with Thyroid issus. Further more, I was also treated 10-12 years ago for  hyperprolactinemia with bromocriptine and since then my prolactin levels have always been normal, included the recent one i did showed 6.8. My mother has hyperthyroidism and so it does run in the family. I am concerned that my TSH was that high, is that normal? Would it be related to  hyperprolactinemia? I am not able to get an appointment with a specialist till Nov-Dec and so any information regarding the issue would be very VERY helpful. I do sometimes feel nauseous, and there are times in the afternoon where i may feel very tired....but I am confused about the blood work. Please shed some light. I can not even talk to any of the nurses on staff because i am \"NOT YET\" a patient with their clinic...So....as you can see.....VERY FRUSTRATING :(\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Well your TSH is so high there's every likelihood you have hypothyroidism, and very probably a virtually non-functioning thyroid. It isn't normal, which is why you've been put on thyroxine. This, combined with the symptoms of fatigue you describe fill out the typical picture of new-onset hypothyroidism.   Thyroid disease and dysfunction can often run in families and the malfunction isn't always the same one from person to person (one may be hypo- and another hyper-, etc.).   I would advise you to go along with the attempt to regulate with thyroxine until you are able to be seen by the specialist, who may be able to regulate the dosage more accurately. If you develop any unpleasant symptoms such as flushing, uncomfortable warmth, rapid heart rate, etc.,  please advise your doctor right away so he can adjust the thyroxine doseage. On the other hand you may find yourself feeling a lot better after a couple weeks on the replacement therapy.  Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

I attributed the knot to the central line thinking that it weakend a tendon or such. However, when I feel the pop I can feel a hard marble size knot on the right side that  I can push  or should I say pop back in .When it pops out there is pain along the right side of the neck and jaw. As soon as I pop it back in I feel fine, no pain. The other night this happened and I had a hard time popping it back in. After a while I got it back in. when I woke up I still had neck pain and finally went to my PCP. He felt a slightly enlarged thyroid on palpitation, along with possible muscle strain. I went for a ultrasound of the thyroid and it shows small nodules on the right side and enlarged thryoid on that side. My previous thyroid tests were WNL. The PCP said that the nodules were very small and that when I go for my Px in October he will run some more tests.I have had some difficulty swallowing and continue to have a dull ache on the right side since the incident earlier this week. What other tests should I request when I next speak to my PCP? What are the major concerns? What additional s/sx should I be looking for that something else may be going on? What could I possibly be popping back into my neck?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: knot pops out in right side of neck, can pop it back in",
    "content": "Hi there -  Often a central line is in place long enough for scar tissue to form around the site, and this could easily appear as a knot. due to the vessel lying in a groove or channel in your neck, the knot may now have \"cured\" sufficiently to allow it to work its way out of the channel and to be pushed back into place. It's probably not anything to be concerned about, unless it just keeps moving and starts to drive you crazy. It may not be amenable to simple surgical repair -- but then again it might be. It could probably be visualized only via MRI, since it is likely essentially soft tissue.   The other possibility is  that where the central line was planted a lymph node has become cystic. again, probably nothing to be  overly concerned about, but it  likely would be best if it could be repaired or removed.  I hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

I've never heard of this happening, but then I'm not all that knowlegeable about the statistics on this.  At any rate, great news! You'll undoubtedly want to be followed for a while, even if no further symptoms develop, but meanwhile just enjoy the remarkable turn of events.   Best of luck to you.\n\n",

I'm not sure that anything can be done about it, at least if it is because of the metaprolol. If you've been taking that for a long time then perhaps something has changed metabolically (thyroid?) which is working in conjunction with the beta blocker to cause this annoying but essentially benign symptom.

Severe short-term memory loss is characteristic of deficiency of somatotropin, the main pituitary hormone in adults (better known as \"growth hormone\" in children).  It is also a common feature of hypothyroidism, which may result from a deficiency of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) production by the pituitary.  Head trauma is one of the common causes of hypopituitarism (especially for somatotropin deficiency).  It can also cause the\"post concussive syndrome,\" which frequently includes memory loss.  You did not say what medications you are on, but the context suggests an argument over the hormone replacement therapy.  I would point out to your non specialist physician that the side effects of correcting deficiencies of hormones is to make you closer to normal, not further from it.  If your non specialist physician really cannot understand that, keep your endocrinologist and find a better non specialist.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tweeters  What is your IGF-1 (old name, somatomedin C) level?  For your age, the dose of somatotropin (\"growth hormone\") sounds about right, except that you are taking oral estragens.  Oral estrogens roughly double the requirement for somatotropin, making your dose unusually low for your age.  This may be relevant to your memory problems.  From what you are telling me, you have a deficiency of at least four out of six pituitary hormones, and one of the other two m(prolactin) ight be deficient, but is never replaced.  If you have four (or five) pituitary hormone deficiencies, there is a very high chance that you have a deficiency of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which controls the thyroid.  Unless someone compares the free thyroxine (main thyroid hormone) level with the TSH level, this is unlikely to be recognized.  Not only am I an endocrinologist, but I have a Ph.D. in Physiology and Biophysics for my work with the thyroid.  Unfortunately, most physicians (and an embarrassingly large number of endocrinologists) only look at the TSH.  It is maddening to me to have to listen to the mindless mantra that \"TSH is the single best test of thyroid function,\" when TSH is a lousey single test!  In addition to never relying upon the TSH alone, I also have a standardized physical examination and questionnaire that I use.  Even then, the thyroid hormone status is not always clear-cut.  One thing that is clear, however, is that laboratories are still using out-of-date reference ranges for TSH; even if your pituitary still secretes TSH appropriately (which I doubt), you may still be symptomatically hypothyroid and yet fall within the laboratory's reference ranges.  Most endocrinologists now prefer giving estrogens through the skin and using estradiol, rather than horse estrogens.  This would also have less of an effect on your need for somatotropin, far more than making up for the higher cost of estrogen patches or gel.  There are a number of concerns about medroxyprogesterone, which I have largely stopped using in favor of actual progesterone.  The one advantage of medroxyprogesterone is that it has some \"male\" (testosterone-like) effects, but I prefer to use appropriate doses of testosterone whenever possible.  I hope that you are getting annual DEXA bone densitometry, since you are taking prednisone.  For reasons that are not clear, even true \"replacement\" doses cause loss of bone density, and the traditional doses are more than replacement equivalents (Technically, there is no replacement dose of prednisone, because the body makes cortisol, instead of prednisone.  Unfortunately, cortisol would go in one end and out the other, so we use equivalent doses of synthetics that can be taken by mouth.)  Your original question had to do with your non specialist physician insisting that your memory problems were due to your medications.  Your list of medications confirms my fears about your non specialist physician.  It would be very difficult to say anything more about him without being extremely insulting.  Instead, let me say that if you are not required to have a non specialist physician and your endocrinologist is willing to assume principal care, you should just drop the non specialist--otherwise, find another non specialist physician (Your endocrinologist can suggest names of physicians with whom he works well, if you ask him to do so.)  There are many things that can interfere with the memory.  Abnormal thyroid function, somatotropin deficiency, head trauma (post concussive syndrome), sleep deprivation, narcolepsy, sleep apnea, depression . . . .This should definitely be pursued.  Sometimes, subspecialists do not want to deal with problems outside of their own fields, so your endocrinologist might not want to pursue the non endocrine possibilities, and you may need someone else to give you the appropriate referals.

    "content": "Hi there, my IGF-1 Levels are always tested, and always are within the normal range. I will mention to my endocrinologist about increasing the growth-hormone dosage. The \"TSH\" test is what I always get tested for, and it usually comes back within normal range as well. I finally got my endocrinologist to listen to me, so he is sending me for some more extensive bloodwork tomorrow (hopefully this will include further thyroid tests)... hopefully they will be able to learn something from that! As for bone density, my non-specialist physician has tested me for that and it was fine, but I will keep an eye on it. As far as the memory issues, I have not had any head trauma that I know of, and no specific incident which I relate to affecting my memory. That's why I'm so stymied! Hopefully in meeting again with my endocrinologist, he will be able to figure out something to help me with this issue. Thanks again for your reply, it's really good to hear that my concerns are legitimate.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tweeters:  I'm sorry that your experience with your endocrinologist was so poor.  In a separate email, you told me that he increased your somatotropin (\"growth hormone\") and prednisone, but told you that your memory problems had nothing to do with your pituitary.  I am curious to know what the laboratory levels actually were.  Without doing a detailed history and physical examination and seeing your labs myself, it is impossible for me to know whether or not your hormone replacement doses are appropriate.  However, I can assure you that some hormones that are dependent upon the pituitary definitely do have effects upon the memory, and anyone who says otherwise has a real problem.  I have previously discussed some of those effects, which include thyroid hormones and the sex steroid hormones..  Prednisone (a synthetic substitute for cortisol, which is normally under the control of ACTH from the pituitary) could have either favorable or unfavorable effects, and this may depend not only upon the dose, but time of day, relationship to the memory formation, and the chronicity of the hormone level (See separate email.).  I am very concerned that anyone, much less an endocrinologist, would simply double the dose of prednisone without laboratory or other evidence that the dose was inadequate.  The effects of somatotropin on memory are pronounced, and there is extensive literature to support this.  Interestingly, too much glucocorticoid (such as prednisone) interferes with the actions of somatotropin and insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1), and many of the features seen with glucocorticoid excess may be due to these effects on somatotropin and IGF-1.  Having said these things, I have no way of knowing whether or not your memory problems actually are related to your pituitary dysfunction.  From your descriptions, it sounds as if your memory problems are disabling.  If you cannot get anyone to investigate them in your area, I do not know what to tell you.  I would be happy to see what I could do to help you, but Calgary, Alberta, Canada is a very long way from Lima, Ohio, USA![/b]\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm very thin (5'10\", 125 lbs), yet I eat a lot, or at the very least, normally. Recently, I tried to gain weight by having a fairly large serving of pasta every lunch, and pizza every night... For 3 weeks... On weekends, every saturday, I would order a full pizza and eat it all. I did not gain a pound.  I'm suffering from mild narcolepsy -- even if I'm well rested, I have a tendency to nod off in the middle of the day... Before or after meals... Even coffee won't prevent it. It's causing me trouble at work... Hard to be productive when you spend half the day fighting to stay awake... I also have a very low reaction time... Poor attention span... I can feel that something's different from when I was a kid, I feel slow.  Another odd thing is that I look much younger than most people my age... I'm 23 and facial and chest hair is still scarce, even though men in my family are generally hairy.  I'm thinking the fact that I apparently can't store any fat whatsoever and the fact that I'm generally feeling tired, somewhat weak, are linked...  I was wondering if this sounds like anything typical... I've done \"generic tests\" over the years, and they never found anything wrong... They were all blood tests, and counts of various things were normal, I'm healthy as can be, apparently.  Particularly, I'm wondering what I should ask my doctor next time I see him... Any specific tests that would be useful, or maybe a specialized practitioner I should try to get an appointment with?  And how serious could it be? I've been looking at insulin resistance, which has a lot of symptoms I can relate to... Wouldn't want it to degenerate into diabetes if it can be prevented...  Thanks for any advice!  - ben\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It is difficult to make educated guesses at a distance, and diagnosing is, of course, impossible without the ability to look at and talk with a patient in \"real\" time. That said, your complaints sound  as though they could be due to two different things going on at once: narcolepsy is almost always due to sleep apnea, which would go a long way toward explaining that part, if a sleep study were done and confirmed the diagnosis. However, sleep apnea is most common in people who are overweight (but this is not a rule, just a footnote); second, you do sound as though you may be suffering from a malabsorption syndrome as well, due to the inability to gain weight. Ironically, if you do have celiac disease (the most common cause of malabsorption) then your consuming large amounts of pasta and pizza would only aggravate the problem.   Now then: celiac disease generally also causes abdominal discomfort, bloating, and irregular, highly aromatic, fatty stools as well. It can also cause fatigue,  lack of stamina, etc. If any of these apply in your case there is a blood test to determine if you have this  problem, and it is managed by eliminating gluten from  the diet, meaning far less pasta, pizza, and a few other things (gluten, the offending substance, is in a surprising number of foods one wouldn't associate with  wheat).   Both these problems need to be ruled  out (or in) as well as some other metabolic disorders which could be causing your symptoms. I hope you'll  follow up with an inernist and get the appropriate specialty referrals in order to find out what's going on and get it managed.   Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  i was brought into the hospital last fall because i thought i had a stroke...the symptoms were no muscle control, fascics and severe muscle cramping along with anxiety and fainting...i basically felt my legs go weak and fell down a flight of stairs, blacked out a couple of time...i thought i was dying...i had very low BP(84/48), dehydrated and low heart rates(48) all through hospital stay...i had my heart checked out which is OK...i don't have MS or Lupus...i eat a lot of salt and wear compression socks to keep the BP up.  i am on cymbalta for the cramping pain.  when i got to the hospital, they ran some MRI's and discovered a pituitary tumor...they ran hormone tests and everything was fine exept i had a very low cortisol level and higher than average prolactin...  they ran a stim test and i reacted fine to it...the pituitary tumor was designated as non-functioning and i was sent home...i am still having these symptoms...i have been fatigued and have had sore muscles since last year...before i ended up in the ER, my family doctor and i were slowly trying to uncover why i was fatigued. the only thing discovered was 'leukapenia'...she had no idea about pituitary adenoma...but, she sent me to a neurologist to find out about the muscle symptoms...  i had an EMG/NCV done and i was told i had left leg atrophy with peripheral neuropathy  i also saw a neurosurgeon who said that since my tumor was embedded in the pituitary and it was .9 cm...it was best to leave it alone with follow up to check growth, function...  i thought i was doing better with the twitching, cramping, but then i got a viral infection and everything went downhill for me.  i followed up with endo doctor who won't do another hormone panel for 6 mos...and although she found thyroid nodules, she diagnosed them as non cancerous and will watch them along with pituitary.  i asked how could she know my cortisol won't drop again and cause me to flop like a fish on the floor?  she said, \"trust me...your adrenal function is fine...\"   my questions are these\"  1.  could the cramping, twitching and muscle weakness be from low cortisol levels? (my neuro says i don't have ALS, but can't figure out the cause of these symptoms)  2. can ACTH production be inconsistant? and if so, how can it be fixed or found out?  3. is there any tests for this?  4. should i ask for another stim test or should i just go along with the program?(i need to get back to work and life and i am sleeping 12-14 hours a day)  5. i began having foamy urine, but no protein loss according to doctors...this started at the same time everything else did...could this be from cortisol dumped out of my body?  6. should i go get second endo opinion?    thank you.

    "title": "Re: low cortisol levels with pituitary tumor",
    "content": "Hello -  First,  before answering your numbered questions, I'd like to point out that a viral infection, given the compromised pituitary function, could, indeed, be responsible for your renewed symptoms. Cortisol, which is normally the controlling factor of adrenal function, can be exhausted by a virus or other infection, and so even if adrenal function is normal on a given day, it may not be metered properly during an infectious illness. Once that's past, all other things remaining equal, it should regain its equilibrium.   Now then: your numbered questions:  1) It seems reasonable to assume the cramping, twitching, etc., are related to low levels of cortisol. It is difficult to prove, but it is easy to make the leap of logic.  2,3) ACTH production can certainly be variable, even without the presence of a tumor. Again, illness can cause an effective lowering of available ACTH for a time. This is relatively normal. Testing is possible, but because of normal variations in serum availablitiy the result may not be meaningful.  4) You could ask for another stim test, but again, with a tumor present, the results may not be meaningful this soon after the first test.  5) Foamy urine can be caused by a great many things and usually has little significance. I don't know whether cortisol dumping would cause this.   6) If you continue to experience symptoms and the current endocrinologist chooses to stay the course then you would certainly be justified in looking for a second opinion.  Hopefully this is helpful to you. Good luck and please follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  I am a RN by trade and have been absolutely baffled by my own condition.  I am now heading to my third specialist--an Endocrinologist.  This all started with and elelvated ANA level (triple the normal), extreme fatigue, muscle aches, headaches,  blurred vision (off and on) with difficulty with night-time driving and insomina (like I just couldn't calm down).  Rehumatologist at Mayo Clinic told me not Lupus, not MS, no connective tissue disease disorder, etc. Told me alot of what it was not.  Referred to cardiologist.  It would appear that my blood pressure and heart rate are ok while I am sitting (101/70, pulse in 70's) yet the minute I stand up it shoots up (138/90 and pulse to 120).  If I continue walking it goes to 150's.  My night-time pulse oximetry evidenced it also does that during the night when I am sleeping but not continuously). Cardiologist said my heart is fine but my ejection fraction is elevated to 76%. Bottom line, my heart is beating way too fast and way too hard. So, no exercising, no housework, no stimulants (I don't drink coffee, tea or any caffeinated products because I felt like I was going to stroke out my heart was going so crazy). Still no better even off the diet soda.    I don't feel rested after I nap or sleep.  They gave me a sleeping pill which helps me but if I get up to go to the bathroom, it's like I went out for a jog and it takes my body about 1/2 hour to 45 min to calm down and fall asleep again.  My 24 hour urine was, basically, normal. My cortisol level was slightly low at 3 (normal started at 4).  TSH normal.  Endocrinologists are very difficult to get into.  What should I have them look at once I do get in to see one?  I just want a thorough exam.  I am tired of being tired.  I know that I am NOT depressed.  I know stress isn't causing this because when I am sitting, all is fine no matter what I am thinking about or dealing with. It's only when I stand up that things start to go hyperspeed.  I sit down when the shortness of breath starts.    Any ideas?????  I am 42, not overweight and other than the Ambien the only other thing I take is a multivitamin (no herbal supplements either).  I never thought I would say this, but I miss the gym.....................don't even take my usual walk with my husband and daughter anymore...........this is crazy.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Low Cortisol levels and tachycardia",
    "content": "Hello -  You would seem to have either a variant of inappropriate sinus tachycardia syndrome (IST), and since your cortisol level was actually a  little bit on the low side my other hunch (pheochromocytoma) seems less likely, but if you're going to see an endocrinologist then this is one area likely to be studied more closely. The 24-hour urine results argue against it and so does the fact that this only happens when you stand and/or move.   The high ANA titer certainly is a concern, even though the Mayo doctors have told you there is no connective tissue disease. It seems completely counter to the test result, which may need to be repeated (as well as the other tests).   It is almost as though you are having a reflex dysautonomia, the opposite of a vasovagal response. I'm  not sure how one tests to prove such a condition, since I'm not sure what the opposite of a tilt table test would be.   While an endo workup is certainly warranted in order to eliminate all the possibilities, I suspect there is something a lot like neurocardiogenic syncope in reverse happening here, and the same baroreceptor focus may be at fault, but doing the opposite from what one usually sees. I  think another visit to the cardiologist may be warranted as well. I would think a beta blocker would be the shortest route to short-term relief of the symptoms and reduction of high cardiac output.   Good luck to you and please let us know what you find out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While your cortisol was about right and the DHEA also normal, it seems unlikely you are suffering adrenal burnout, but these saliva tests are less than reliable. A 24-hour urine test as well as bloodwork would be  appropriate to really know if you're for some reason suffering from adrenal exhaustion. I'm not sure why your doctor won't test for hormones, as it is only a matter of collecting specimens and sending them to a lab. However, I get the feeling I'm not getting the whole story here. What sort of medication did caused a reaction that has left you bed bound? What sort of prognosis do you carry for this and how long are you anticipating having to remain bedbound?   All this would help, but in lieu of those facts I would say it seems unlikely you're sufferening adrenal exhaustion. Again, I'm not sure what led you to wonder this  to begin with.  Please follow up if you haven't by now learned the answer to your question.\n\n",

    "content": "Age 54, Female, postmenopausal seven years. Diagnosis 2003: Diagnosed with Subclinical hypothyroidism and then under treated. February - March 2007: Continued under treated hypothyroidism and experiencing extreme symptoms; fluctuating back and forth from very hot and sweating to ice cold and temperature plummeting to 95.8, shaking chills, extreme fatigue, insomnia, chest pain, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, exhaustion and more.  Mid July 2007: Endocrinologist diagnosed me with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis based on heredity.  Fall of 2007: Diagnosed with perimyocarditis; very ill with complications - hospitalized three times in CCU. Placed on high-dose Ibuprofen, and Colchicine. In January 2008: Perimyocarditis healed as per cardiologist and internist. Mid January 2008: Diagnosed with fungal infection (originally dx as yeast infection), groin area due to suppressed immune system from long-term, high-dose, Ibuprofen and Colchicine. February 2008: Diagnosed with ID Reaction due to incorrect treatment for fungal infection. March 2008: Diagnosed with Thyroid Eye Disease by ophthalmologist.  Current medication: Synthroid 200 mcg Vitamins and minerals: 1200 mg calcium, 600 mg magnesium, 2-a day high-potency multi-vitamin, 1000 mg Vit B12, q 3 days Vit B-50's.  Current test results 4/14: TSH   1.07  nr 0.5 - 5.45; FT3   2.83  nr 2.5 - 3.9; FT4   1.21  nr 0.58 - 1.64.  4/14: My doctor felt a nodule and enlarged thyroid, ordered an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed a normal thyroid without a nodule. I have a cough, sometimes choke on saliva/water, don't tolerate dry foods, feel pressure on throat. Previous test result 3/20: TSH   0.58  nr 0.5 - 5.45  For about 4 months, starting in mid-June, I was stable on 150 mcg Synthroid. Then I required dose increases to 200 mcg over the next 4 months never being stable since. However, I would appear to be stable and then my thyroid would fail some more.  My symptoms started again two weeks after my last TSH result of 0.58. I began an exercise program, slowly. When I worked up to 12 minutes per day, three times a week, my hypothyroid symptoms returned with a vengeance; ice cold, shaking chills; profuse sweating; muscle cramping of entire left side from foot to hip; nausea; dizziness; fatigue; exercise intolerance; muscle aches and pains and twitching; joint pains; insomnia; shortness of breath; chest wall pain; heart palpitations; cold hands and feet; blurry vision left eye (new symptom); dry skin; swollen fingers, hands, eyelids; boils and worsening rashes; headaches which are sudden and painful and quick to go (new symptom). I usually feel great around 0.5. I was surprised to find my TSH had jumped to 1.07 in only 3.5 weeks.   Is this normal to not be stable when you have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis with a normal-sized thyroid gland? If not, what could be the problem? I'm getting referred to an endocrinologist because the internist is stumped and because he doesn't want to keep my TSH under 1.07, where I feel my best. I feel good around 0.5 to 1.0. As soon as I get over 1.0 I know it, all my symptoms return and I become very ill.  Could it be all the illnesses I had which caused my thyroid symptoms to worsen?  Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -   While this is far from my specialty I can tell you that stability doesn't always settle in quickly with thyroiditis, and even then things can become unstable  from time to time (which is why thyroid panel is performed periodically in supposedly stable patients anyway). Also, yes, normal thyroid size is sometimes noted even with thyroiditis. One wouldn't think so, but this is one of the vagaries of Hashimoto's disease.   I would get a second opinion, however, since you seem to know where your comfort zone lies, and you need someone who is willing to work with you instead of strictly by the  book.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

If you were ready to conceive a child, this might be of greater concern for you but it is not a real problem now.  I realize many women like the feeling of being \"normal\" that comes with a monthly cycle, but it is not actually necessary for good health.  It also assures women who are sexually active that they are not pregnant.  There are treatments to help the side effects of PCOS so you may with to consult with your gynecologist if this is a problem for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It can be very difficult to adjust hormones to replicate the body's \"normal\" functioning.  It takes patience and trial and error.  Be in touch with your doctors to be sure they understand exactly what you are experiencing.  I would suggest a journal where you log everything - how you feel, what you are doing at the time, what you eat, what medications you take, what helps, what seems to hurt or make it worse.  Take this with you when you see your doctor.  I believe it is probably all related but that it just isn't yet settled.  In the meantime, be diligent about eating healthy foods - it can only help.

    "content": "I suffered from anorexia from age 16-20. I have since gained weight (5'3'' 122 lbs) and recovered from the illness. I was on birth control from age 15-22. In September 2007 my husband and I decided to stop using birth control and I stopped taking the pill (Yasmin). Within days I started to lose extreme amounts of hair and experienced vasomotor instability symptoms--my hands would become bright red and hot at times or other areas--like my ears or nose. I went to    my doctor in January and she had my blood tested. This included a full metabolic panel, thyroid function, as well as my gonadotropin hormone levels. All came out normal except for my estradiol level which was 26. My FSH level was 4.4 and my LH level was 3.5. She said she did not think I was going through premature ovarian failure because my FSH and LH levels were not at menopausal levels. It is now March   and I am still experiencing the same symptoms. I had my estradiol tested again and it was 19. Why is this level decreasing and not increasing? Can someone at my age have hot flashes due to low estrogen and not be going through menopause? Do you think I will ever be able to get pregnant? What treatments would you suggest?  Thank you!  Kellie\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Kellie,  As your doctor was implying, typically with menopause, the FSH and LH levels begin to rise because the ovaries are not making enough estrogen.  As a response to the low estrogen, the body tries to stimulate more production by increasing the FSH and LH.    With a normal FSH and LH it seems that your body is not sensing a deficiency in estrogen although the symptoms you describe do fit low estrogen levels.  This is a little outside my area of expertise so I would recommend you see an endocrinologist or a reproductive endocrinologist (a specialist in pregnancy problems/gynecologic endocrinology).    You may want to have your prolactin level checked.  An elevated prolactin level will result in decreasing estrogen levels.  Among possible causes of low estrogen, this is one of the more common causes.  Best wishes.  I wish I could be of more help.\n\n",

    "content": "**Sorry for double post-no one answered me in the other one.  I am male, turning 21 in a few months and I think I have high- serotonin-level-caused Erectile Dysfunction. I take daily vitamins with no history of surgery or any pertinent family disease.  I started noticing this a few months ago. Back then, I can get an erection at will every 3-4 hours and be very aroused when I see an attractive woman. Then suddenly, I couldn't get aroused at all. I tried not masturbating for a while and it worked for a few weeks and then it went away again.  I tried to find causes on the internet and found that it may be Prostatitis or Cystatis, but I got a clean bill of health from two different doctors. And it can't be sexually transmitted because I'm still a virgin.  And then I researched some more and found that high serotonin levels can cause low libido. I think that this is the reason because I used to be very anxious and a worry-wart all the time. Apparently high serotonin levels lessen anxiety and emotions in general as I researched. So basically it's like I'm taking Prozac even if I'm not.  I've read that too much porn and masturbation can cause high serotonin levels. If this is the case then I guess that it is what happened to me because I used masturbate and watch porn a lot. The funny thing is, other than the fear of not being able to perform, I feel perfectly healthy and mentally more relaxed than ever. The high serotonin levels I speculate I have got rid of my social anxiety (just like Prozac I guess).  I can still ejaculate fine, without pain whatsoever. But it's not as fun as years ago. And I am able to masturbate only on very few occasions. I am worried that I can not please a woman.\n\n",

    "content": "There are cases where porn and masturbation do interfere with sexual function between a man and a woman.  You may want to consider eliminating the porn to see if you can get back into a more typical frame of mind sexually.  The effect of pornography on the brain is something science has been studying and it can be very addictive, much like other substance abuse, requiring more and stronger stimulation to get the same effect.   This is one of the ways it interferes with a relationship.  There are support groups and counselors to help you if you desire to take this course of action.  I think this would be your best solution to the problem but that doesn't mean it would be easy to accomplish.  It is possible, however.  The biggest problem is that once imprinted on the brain, those images are difficult to erase.  If your partner doesn't have the same unrealistic qualities you see in photos, etc. (keep in mind this is fantasy) you may be unable to become aroused, just as you fear.  This is why I believe eliminating it could be your best solution.    Most likely you are dealing with a psychological issue here more than a physical one so I doubt any medication would reverse this problem.  Good luck and let us know if you have other questions.\n\n",

Now I have a thyroid mass on my left lobe measuring 4.6x4.2x6.0cm that is solid with multiple linear cystic spaces within it.  There are linear echogenic foci and a coarse calcification within this nodule (as stated in ultrasound/FNA report).  My right nodule demonstates multple tiny cystic spaces and bright linear foci.  The FNA came back negative.  The left nodule has deviated my trachea and is compressing my esophagous and jugular.  I am awaiting surgery for removal of thyroid but cannot get the go ahead until my adrenal tumors are totally looked at.  I also have bilateral adrenal tumors (small- 1.5 cm and 2.3 cm) which when tested two years ago were not secreting.  Now I have been having the obvious lump in my throat feeling, choking feeling (off and on) and some shortness of breath which seems positional.  Also, I have long history of hard to control hypertension which is now controlled beautifully with 3 different meds, including diuretics), daily low grade fevers (99.8-100.9) which directly correspond to activity level (sitting down, my temp. lessens, being up my temp. rises), night sweats, flushing, fatigue, weakness, shakiness from time to time, some periods of anxiousness and racing heart, episodes where I lose my hearing like one does when they are going to faint, edema (significant), weight gain despite eating less than 1000 calories a day with alternating periods of weight loss, hirutism, and most recently elevated glucose readings (not fasting).  My endo. is looking at they thyroid (hypothyroidism vs. hashi) and adrenals (pheo. vs. cushings).  It seems that I have some symptoms of each.  My labs so far are as follows: TSH - 6.1 (0.4-5.0) H DHEA Sulfate - 82 (35-430) Thyroxine Free - 1.03 (0.70-1.85) Thyroidglobulin - 133 ( <38 ) H Thyroidglobulin Antibody - <1.8 (<4.0) Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody - 2403 (<35) H Glucose 210 (60-99) H? nonfasting Testosterone, Total - 24 (14-75) VMA, Urine - 7.8 (<8.0) Metanephrine, Urine - 128 (30-180) Normethatnephrine, Urine - 697 (119-451) H (Two years ago this was in the normal range) Metanephrine, Total, Urine - 825 (156-561) H Sed Rate = 44 (0-20)  H WBC= has been slightly elevated off and on. Mild microcytic anemia  I am awaiting more test results including cortisol free results and MRI results (adrenal tumors).    My question is no single thing seems to stand out as causing all my symptoms.  My symptoms seem to conflict and many of my labs are good.  Do any of these symptoms point to one thing more than the other and what do they look like to you?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Hashimoto's is a complex thyroid disorder defying labs and medications.  I don't know why they told you the synthroid would cure it because this is a disease that is managed; not cured.   I can't evaluate your labs but you should be in regular contact with your endocrinologist to be sure you are in the best treatment plan.  The doctor should be able to explain this well.  If not, I would recommend seeing a different doctor and having copies of your labs and records sent for evaluation.  But, labs do not tell the whole story - they are merely helpful in finding answers and each person can have variations that do keep even the best confused at times.  Your doctor needs to examine you, check out your swallowing concerns, shortness of breath, weight gain, etc.  It is complex and every individual is different in their health and illness response.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Hypothyroidism: Best weight loss plan???",
    "content": "I am 25 years old and have recently been diagnosed with Hypothyroidism.  Apparently, this does run in my family, but my doctor was still surprised that I have developed it at such a young age, as I always had a high metabolism as a child.  By that, I mean that I never gained a lot of weight.  I have always been a very healthy weight for my body type until recently.    After having my second and last child, as well as a tubal, I did quite well for the first year and a half.  However, over the last six months, I have had a declining energy level, severe fatigue and a need to sleep more than 12 hours a day.  This is not like me at all.  I am used to sleeping between 6 and 8 hours, working 8-10 hours a day and then running after my kids and doing housework for the remainder of the day.  Now I am lucky to make it to 5pm before I am in serious need of a nap.  All my labs show that my thyroid levels are only slightly below normal, so I am not on medication yet, but I have gained almost 20 lbs in the last three months!  I guess my main concern is that I don't know if there are certain foods that I should be avoiding due to this and if a weight loss plan would be advisable, as I have a bad back as well and the weight gain isn't good for that.  I used to work at a health food store, so I am pretty sure that there are things I shouldn't be eating because while I am sure that they don't directly effect my thyroid hormone production, they may cause sugar crashes that would just add to the side effects of lack of thyroid hormone.  I have been trying to cut out most of the high sugar and high fat foods from my daily diet, but I am wondering if you might have some other suggestions.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "I first had trouble with my thyroid at age 19 ( I am now 42)  when I found a cyst, and after a lot of testing was put on medication until my bloodwork came back \"normal\" I didn't think about it much until I had trouble in 2000 and retested again. One Dr said if things didn't straighten out, he wanted to radiate my thyroid and kill it, but my levels became \"normal\" again until last April with these labs: TSH  . 12  (0.34 \u2013 5.60) Thyroxine free  . 7  (.6 \u2013 1.6)   They waited a month retested me and my labs were:   TSH  .10  (0.34 \u2013 5.60) Thyroxine Free .8 (.6 \u2013 1.6) T 3 was \u201cnormal\u201d   After this I had an MRI of my pituitary ((normal), an ultrasound (multi nodular goiter, with cysts), FNA (negative), and a RAI Uptake (both cold and hot spots). I also had these labs done: Atch < 5 (6 \u2013 48 PG/mg) HumanGrowth Hormone 0.1 (6.0 -28.0 UG/DL) Cortisol am serum 7.7 (6.0 \u2013 28.0 UG/DL) I was told these were normal    At this point mid August they finally started me on levox 50 mcg I was retested 8 weeks later and my labs were: TSH .03 (0.34 \u2013 5.60) Thyroxine Free 1.0 (0.6 \u2013 1.1) They cut my dose to .25 mcg.   I was just retested last week and my labs were:    TSH .09 (0.34 \u2013 5.60) FT4 0.95 (0.7 \u2013 2.0)  Now they have cut my dose to 12.5 mcg  I know I just threw a lot of numbers and information at you and I appreciate you taking the time to look at this for me. I had no treatment until August, and the labs just don\u2019t make sense. I noticed that no matter what dose I am on, that my numbers don't change much. I also was pointed to an article about Central hypothyroidism, and that one thing that can cause it is lithium. When I was 13 or 14, I was being treated with lithium and being young and stupid, and influenced an older crowd, I actually snorted it. I don't know how long I was on Lithium, and my parents are deceased now. But I do know that after it was discovered that I was taken off all medication, and went on to be a fine young person.  Thank-you for your time\n\n",

New to town, I went to a family doctor since the waiting list for an Endo was several months long.  Thyroid scan and ultrasound revealed no hot spots and was told a goiter was pretty normal.  (?)  Thryoid labs have typically been normal but always on the low side of normal.  August 2007, all thyroids were off track w/ levels varying.  Yes, weight gain, A1C's higher since I am a Type 1 Diabetic since 1980, tired, tired and more tired.  I have suffered from hair loss for years and wear custom made hairpieces that no one realizes but the unexplained weight gain and constant lethargy are unreal.  My skin has changed so much and I look like I have aged.  I itch at times so badly I can make my skin bleed, I wake up at night in sweats yet all my hormones have been tested and I am fine.  No menopause symtoms. I have a reg. cycle each month.  All of my vitamin levels have been tested and are adequate.  No anemia issues.  My bones hurt from head to toe and I can't breathe when going up the stairs or walking. I am producing over 6000 peroxidase antibodies and failed the iodine patch test.  Thus far, this Endo I finally got an appointment with takes me off of Armour Thyroid as he is not sure it is my Thyroid.  What the heck is it then?  He says antibodies are normal.  Over 6000 is normal?  The sliding scale was 0-50 w/ virtually NO TSH levels.  Tested negative for Lupus and Rheumatoid factor and MRI of pituitary is clear. My memory is also going.  They did a brain scan of something and I think it was my pituitary.  I am about to lose my mind.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  Laura\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Laura,  From your story it seems you had virtually no TSH levels and you were on Armor Thyroid. Armor thyroid is thyroid hormone tablet which is given to those who do not produce enough thyroid hormone of their own. Once it is started TSH levels start to go down. An undetectable TSH in a patient taking Armor means the dose is proving too high. Hence your Endo asked you to stop it. Now a TSH repeat should be done after 8 weeks off treatment and then decide about your thyroid status and dose after that.   Meanwhile due to all this confusion you seem to have become a little worried and anxious. Just calm down, there is nothing majorly wrong from your story. Have full confidence in your Endocrinologist and follow her instructions to the last word.   Take care,  Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "I have been dealing with a set of symptoms for many years that have been worsening over the last 4 years to include very low energy, extremely easily fatigued, muscle weakness, orthostatic hypotension, insomnia, joint pain that is getting exponentially worse and has resulted in severe osteoarthritis of my spine and knees requiring a knee replacement at age 47, shaking muscles with any use, muscle fasiculations and frequent cramping, plantar fasciitis, fatigue, fatigue, fatigue.  The worsening really became evident in 2004 when I had severe abd pain and began to lose weight.  The pain more or less resolved after LAVH and BSO but continues to a lesser extent.  I never really recovered from surgery.  I had to leave my job due to fatigue and pain and take a different job with shorter shifts.  I am plagued with fatigue and pain and it has robbed  me of living life.  I can barely get through what I have to to survive, much less enjoy anything extracurricular.  I was seen by rheumatologist for 3 years who said i had Inflammatory spondylosing arthritis, but after 3 years decided I didn't and I should go see a pain doc and told me not to return.  Family doc had placed me on 10 mg/day prednisone for the arthritis about 3 1/2 years ago which we had tapered down to 6.5 mg/day by last fall.  Any change in dose had profound negative effect.  I went to see integrative medicine doc last fall and he tested levels of cortisol, dhea and progesterone, and thyroid function.  24 hr urine cortisol was 0.  dhea was too low to read.  progesterone was too low to read.  thyroid function was normal (was on synthroid at the time)  Doc switched me to armour thyroid, switched from prednisone to hyrdrocortisone (i cannot seem to function on less that 60 mg/day and have had 3 episodes of adrenal crisis in the past year.  currently taking 80 mg/day), placed me on multiple supplements.  I had some initial improvement in energy but it didn't last.  We just did the ACTH stim test and my pre level was 0.9, post level was 4.5.  I am at a loss to interpret these results.  The doc thinks 2ndary adrenal insufficiency from steroid use, but I was never on high dose steroids, and I never stopped taking them.  My liver function tests are normal.  Creatinine is often slightly elevated.  Electrolytes come back normal.  Glucose often low normal, especially fasting (60s).         I am a transsexual who has undergone gender reassignment from female to male and I take testosterone 70 mg IM /week.  I don't know how or if that effects  any of what is going on.      I have not seen an endocrinologist, and don't have much opportunity to where I live.  I have read different interpretations of the test results and can't make sense of it.  How does the hyrdrocortisone I take effect the ACTH stim test?  What does it mean?  Can you help?\n\n",

    "title": "IUD long term effects... it has to be.",
    "content": "At two months postpartum I had the Mirena IUD inserted, which as I'm sure you know, releases a steady stream of progesterone into the uterus. Only a month after insertion, I began noticing many problems which I later realized may stem from my IUD, and supporting my theory was much internet research on other women complaining of the same things. After four months I had my IUD removed, and it seemed at this point everything started getting much worse, and more rapidly. I then considered maybe this is just postpartum mess, but after asking several other ladies, they had not recently had a baby, only recently had their IUD inserted. I looked into other alternatives... thyroid, adrenal gland, and now actually low progesterone levels. This is where I want to brain storm and figure out some answers where there are no studies (and I don't have access to a doctor due to no insurance just yet).  Correct me if I'm wrong on any of this, but this is what I have found and is guiding me through a potential answer, so definitely do correct me if I'm wrong. But so the uterus and adrenal glands produce the body's progesterone, the uterus being where the IUD localizes its hormone. I theorized (and only found one other website to barely mention this) that the IUD was possibly just giving my body too much progesterone for it to handle and this set my hormones out of whack, the website saying it can actually lead to excessive estrogen. That somehow means low progesterone due to excess progesterone, right? This seems to rather completely summarize my symptoms, not to mention that the friends that I explain my symptoms to like to suggest \"hey, sounds like menopause at the ripe age of 20!\" I'm thinking this could explain adrenal fatigue and issues of the sort as well.  So there is a possibility that supplementing progesterone would be all I need, right? Especially since it helps in some cases of hypothyroidism. If so, ultimately what I'm wondering, is it okay to have my IUD reinserted, with treatment of my problem? Could it possibly even actually help? And if so, why would I have experienced symptoms while the IUD was in, giving me progesterone? Could it possibly be like a burst of hormones while it is new, given that users can expect bleeding for up to three months due to the hormone, and then it balances back down? Or am I just completely wrong on all of this about progesterone's potential effects?  Another question, when it was in me, I had one set of symptoms. When it came out, I had week or two of a decrease in symptoms, and then a new set of similar symptoms. Then another break, then another similar set. And repeat again. My symptoms do keep bouncing around while still being related (cold intolerance, heat intolerance, no sleep, can't ever sleep enough, loss of appetite, increased thirst, late period, extended period, etc.), although I have had one symptom last all throughout, complete loss of libido. What makes my symptoms keep changing, whether the cause be thyroid, adrenal gland, or progesterone?  I know I need to see a doctor and have some tests done before I get too carried away, but it's still a while that I have to wait and I get impatient and want to figure it out myself! I definitely appreciate all your time and thought into my ponderings.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I know this is complicated and hormones are constantly fluctuating.  In addition to the usual sex hormones, we also have many other glands releasing hormones to regulate all our bodily functions.  Any of these can get out of whack so it is impossible to guess what is going on.  I don't see any problem with you getting the IUD again.  Giving it a few months to regulate is standard.  You would also have the option of taking a traditional birth control pill which might regulate your hormones.  You should also have your thyroid checked and perhaps other blood work that might help suggest a concern.    It is also possible you have simultaneous problems that are not related at all to the IUD; just coincidental to the placement.  The best thing would be for you to see a doctor so I hope it won't be long before you are able to do so.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Addison's Disease is the most common diagnosis relating to low cortisol levels.  You can learn more about it here: http://www.doctorslounge.com/primary/di ... ddison.htm  Some have also described adrenal fatigue and this can also affect blood sugar, causing hypoglycemia.  It can also result from infection.    Autoimmune disorders can also lead to low cortisol, as well as some medications.  The hypothalamus and pituitary glands release corticostropin releasing hormone (CRH).  Disorders in these glands can cause low cortisol lab results.  As you can see, this can be complex and there is no single medication to just raise the cortisol.  Your wife will need to work with her endocrinologist to get more information but I don't see an association with the POTS.  I'm not an expert, however.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi ~ I'm hoping to get your opinion about my endocrine issues. At age 38 when I was diagnosed a Type 1 diabetic my endo felt that a previous diagnosis of perimenopause was not accurate. Based on my thinning hair, facial hair and erratic periods -- he diagnosed me with PCOS. The irregularity of my periods did not start until I was about 33 - about 2 years after I had my only child. The facial hair has always been with me - although I have gotten much more on my chin and neck over the last few years. The thinning hair started in the past 5 years as well.   I weigh 111 lbs. and am 5' 3\". I have never been overweight and in the past four years have had two ultrasounds (transdermal and transvaginal) and there were no cysts. Up to age 33 - my periods were always on time and the same no matter what was happening. Since starting to see my endo - he has been checking my testosterone level periodically. Over the past two years my testosterone has been steadily increasing. First finding was in the 50's and now it is in the 80's.  My endo has asked for another ultrasound to rule out the possibility of an ovarian tumor that might be secreting the testosterone.   I just haven't felt right about the PCOS diagnosis. I see that I have some of the characteristics but some of these did not start until I was 33 and I definitely don't have insulin resistance.  Based on all of this information, do you think there might be another reason for what is happening?   Thanks for your input.  Cindy\n\n",

I am thinking of taking an arginine supplement (which i have read promotes high levels of HGH in young people) with the hope that i can grow taller, what are your thoughts. Also do you think my growth plates have closed yet.  This is where i read from  http://www.futurescience.com/hgh.html  and the paragraph  \"I personally know of one 19 year-old female who took L-arginine before bedtime for one week. She stopped after one week because it was making her nauseous, which was an indication of an excessive level of HGH release.

    "title": "Re: I want to grow taller",
    "content": "Hello, I agree with Dr. Lowe.  Supplements such as these have not been shown through studies to increase height, and especially once the growth plate has closed.  This is a basic physiological fact that you cannot bypass with medications or supplements.    You will likely waste lots of money and could suffer unpleasant side effects.  Keep in mind that supplements are not regulated through the FDA for purity or even verification of claims that they are what they say they are or do what they claim.  These are entirely different from medications that are regulated, so you use at your own risk.  Of course there are always possible exceptions to every rule and isolated stories will abound, but you can't expect such results - consider it a rare event if it happens and it may not even be related to the supplement.      If this were truly effective, don't you think doctors would jump on it right away to help their many patients for whom this is a concern?  These things are not kept secret from the mainstream medical community.  Try to focus on who you are; not the body you wish you had.  I am a short person and I believe this is the key to being happy.  My son loves basketball and wished to be like Michael Jordan but it just isn't in his genetic makeup.  However, he is a highly successful adult who likes himself in spite of his moderate stature.  You can waste a lot of energy trying to be something different.  I believe in the Serenity Prayer that is used in Alcoholics Anonymous and by many 12 step programs:  God grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, courage to change the things we can, and wisdom to know the difference.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I am an 18 year old female. I have been ill for the past 3 months, with feelings of dizziness, low grade fevers, nausea (but not all the time), excessive sweating, lower back pain, and extreme anxiety. I recently went to an endocrinologist and had a glucose tolerance test done, everything came back normal, except for my adrenal glands. They aren't functioning right, so last week I had to go get an ACTH stimulation test. I won't be expecting the results for a couple weeks.  I'm not very educated on adrenal glands and their function. I was told their was a blockage? and some hormone isnt getting through, and its kind of like its spilling over. I'm not completely sure if i'm remembering correctly, it was all a bit confusing, but from what I understand that's what's wrong. I'm also told that this is a contributing factor to my weight problem. I suppose I'll be more informed once my test results come back. My question is, can all these flu like symptoms and even the intense anxiety that i've been experiencing for 3 months be caused by the problems i'm having with my adrenal glands? Thank you for taking the time to read and answer.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am not an expert here by any means but I do have a question.  You mentioned your weight problem but didn't say if it was underweight or overweight.  Most commonly it is weight loss that is associated with adrenal insufficiency and this is often due to anorexia or dehydration.  I am not familiar with other weight issues surrounding this condition.    Fever is considered to be from infection and possibly aggravated by low levels of cortisol.  It may be that they have not been able to identify the source of infection, however.    But, it is true, your flu-like symptoms can be caused by this because general malaise, fatigue, weakness and loss of appetite are commonly associated with adrenal insufficiency in adults.  It sounds like your doctor is doing a good job checking the systems for other possible causes of your symptoms as well.    Good luck as you await your test results and treatment.  Wishing you a full recovery.\n\n",

I suffer with Anxiety and Panic which have had for 3.5 years now and over last 6 months have had sore breasts and acne. Went to see my GP and he tested my hormone levels. All were fine apart from Estrogen, LH and FSH. Estrogen keeps fluctuating from approx 1700 to 900 to 1200 to 500 to 800 to 1700. All over the place basically. LH and FSH have mild changes likely due to suppresion by estrogen. All other hormones fine including Androgens and Prolactin. My GP said that usually levels like this due to tumor. I have had CA 125 and CEA testing for Ovarian and Bowel Cancer which came back fine and am now awaiting referral to endocrinologist. It was mentioned by GP and hospital that maybe Pituatary Gland or Adrenal, tumour or otherwise. Have you any ideas i.e./ in your experience what do these kind of fluctuating results coincide with, is it likely to be pituatary tumour or are their conditions which can effect pituatary and what are they.

It would be wise to consult with an endocrinologist who may opt to just watch things closely to see what develops or may prescribe medication if he/she finds something that is treatable that way.  There could be a tumor on one of these glands and if so, this could have effects in different areas of your health, including psychiatric disorders like anxiety.  I hope you will be able to see a specialist to get a firm diagnosis.  It will take continued testing, scans, etc. to get the answers you seek.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I got acne, started sweating more, some hair growth on breasts and upper lip, bacterial vaginosis on and off for 10 months now.  I am married and have only had one sexual partner.  I stopped taking birth control 8 months ago and the problems worsened.  I did NOT have any of these problems before I started taking the pill.  All of these problems are also causing me to become depressed, I am not myself anymore.  I did have a complete physical and was told I have high testosterone levels, normal estrogen levels, and normal blood sugar.  I do not have PCOS.  Do you think that the birth control pills could have caused these problems?  I did start progesterone cream last week in hopes it will work.  Do you think this will make the acne go away?  My doctor mentioned Metformin, but I heard of a lot of side effects from this so I am hesitant to try it.  The acne is my major concern.  Is it a possibility that my hormones will eventually regulate themselves?  Or will they regulate themselves after a pregnancy?  (I am not trying to get pregnant right now and never have been pregnant.)  Any help on any of these issues will be appreciated.  Please Help, I'm frustrated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would not hesitate to take the Metformin if I were you.  It is likely to help many of your symptoms since one of the effects is the lowering of testosterone in your body, which causes many of the symptoms you describe.  It is not just used for insulin and glucose regulation with diabetics.  As with many medications, there are off-label uses, meaning it helps in other areas besides the one it was originally used and approved for.  Side effects are likely to be much less bothersome than the symptoms that are causing you such distress now.  Every medication known to man has side effects - sometimes they are even used BECAUSE of the side effects.    There is no guarantee that anything will change with pregnancy and childbirth.  You will just have to see how that goes.  There are other androgenic medications available that can be used as well if needed.   I would recommend you start with Metformin and see how you do over time.  If you are overweight, I would also recommend losing a few pounds.  Exercise is always a good idea, but especially with this concern.  A healthy diet and lifestyle can produce some of the same benefits so if you are adverse to using this medication, at least do some of the alternatives.  You may wish to meet with a dietician and join a gym or some other exercise regime.  You have nothing to lose in doing this.  Good luck\n\n",

    "title": "Low TSH but hypothyroid symptoms - How to direct my GP?",
    "content": "I apologize if this post somewhat duplicates what has already been answered but I need a few more specifics.  I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder in 2004 which progressed to depression in 2006.  I responded well to drug therapy and as of 2007 I am no longer on medication (without issue).   During that time I gained 50 pounds, without changing my habits, adding to my already overweight body.  Since discontinuing my antidepressants almost a year ago, I have been severely fatigued and achy, frequently sleeping 10-12 hours a day and still needing naps.  My voice has always been raspy and hoarse, growing progressively worse as I age.  My menstrual periods are very heavy, usually 5 to 6 days of full bleeding and another 3 or 4 days of spotting.  My basal temp ranges from 97.2 to 97.4.  My allergies (environmental) have gotten worse, I have frequent yeast infections, and my sex drive is nearly non-existent.  I have been keeping my caloric intake below 1200 calories, adhering to a low GI index diet, but the scale is not moving.  At this point, losing weight would be nice but I'm really more concerned with how horrid I feel.  My GP tells me I am just still depressed but my therapist and I are quite sure that I am not.  Then he said I'd feel better if I just exercised, which I would if I could.  I researched and told him I really felt I was hypothyroid and convinced him to test me.  My test results :  TSH 0.29  ; free T4 1.07 both of which he read as normal.  Based on this he determined it was not my thyroid, but something else and is wanting to start me on a battery of tests in another direction.  Given my symptoms, I'm still convinced it's a thyroid issue -- I do not have insurance and do not want to spend lots of money and abandon this possibility when it seems the most obvious option.    In the past he has not been offended that I research things on my own.  If I present him with an educated course of action, he's likely to pursue it.  What should I tell him that it may be and what tests or treatment do you suggest?  The most obvious issue I need to tackle is how my TSH could suggest I am nearly hyperthyroid when symptomatically I appear hypothryoid.  I appreciate your help.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I wonder if your doctor wants to check for other glandular disorders which do in rare cases cause secondary hypothyroidism.  If this is the reason he wants to pursue other avenues it would be consistent with what you are saying but the labs may be different than what is seen in primary hypothyroidism.  Checking for disorders of the pituitary or hypothalamus gland might be useful.  Beyond this, your doctor may have something in mind but I understand your symptoms are suggestive of a thyroid disorder.  But, ultimately it could be discovered that it is something else entirely such as chronic fatigue syndrome or other immune disorder.  I know cost is a consideration but it is important to rule out anything of immediate danger to your health and to get an answer, it may require more testing.  Once he has thoroughly examined thyroid tests, there is little choice but to look to other causes because these screening labs along with the clinical picture are used with your doctor's experience and judgment to come to a diagnosis.  I wish I could be more helpful but from here there's not much to be done.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Lindalo5032,  In most cases of thyroid problems the most sensitive measure of an appropriate thyroid level is the TSH level.  In cases where the T4 is normal but the TSH is low, this condition is often referred to as subclinical hyperthyroidism.  Basically, your body is saying that you have too much thyroid hormone and is shutting down production of  TSH (which signals the thyroid to produce more T4 and T3).    I would recommend you see an endocrinologist to help titrate your levels.  Being hyperthyroid can have some side effects.  The goal is to reach a TSH that is normal.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your response.  Another question--can hyperthyroidism cause angina?  My cardiologist wants to do an angiogram because of my PVC's with angina when exercising.  I believe this might be related to being overmedicated with L-thyroxine and would like to address my thyroid issues before undergoing an angiogram.  I have no family history of heart disease, no risk factors, my lipid profile is OK, although triglycerides are a little high (162).  I have a tight feeling in my chest even when resting, but also when exercising on the treadmill and my heart rate gets up to 140.  So--do you think being over medicated with L-thyroxine could explain the angina?  I would really rather not undergo the angiogram, especially given my lack of family history & risk factors.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Evaluating Blood Test Results",
    "content": "I recently had opposing tests results from both blood and saliva samples for my testosterone levels.  I'm a 43 year old male who has been taking a testosterone supplement (Androgel) for low testosterone most of my adult life.  The last three saliva test over the past eight months showed consistent beyond upper readable limits for testosterone, while the blood test showed low levels.  I went on line and found this article: http://smartlifeforum.org/toolateschmar ... -blood.htm  And here are two telling paragraphs from the article  STEROID HORMONES IN THE BLOOD  Let us use testosterone as an example that is representative of all steroid hormones. Over 90% of the testosterone in the bloodstream is carried by water-soluble proteins (sex hormone binding globulin [SHBG] and albumin). The testosterone bound to those proteins is not readily bioavailable to target tissues because it is on its way to the liver for excretion in bile which enters the intestines when fat is eaten. Along the intestines, about 90% of the bile and testosterone is reabsorbed and recycled to the liver for new processing - thus conserving these valuable biochemicals.  Part of the testosterone-SHBG and testosterone- albumin complexes that went to the liver is converted into water-soluble chemicals that are excreted in the urine. Sometimes, a urine specimen is used to estimate the testosterone in the blood. Less than 10% of total testosterone is bioavailable. More than 80% of this bioavailable (called \"free\") testosterone travels in the blood attracted to (adsorbed on) fatty red blood cell membranes. The other 20% of bioavailable testosterone (2% of total testosterone) is unbound traveling in the plasma, and is readily available to stimulate target tissues.   So are current blood tests (serum) not the proper test for people who take external hormones?  I heard from Androgel that they did all their testing with blood samples.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I do understand your worry.  I'm sorry you feel distressed over this.  Most growth hormones are given for other developmental concerns beyond height and usually when quite young.  Of course there is a genetic component to height and not a lot we can do to change that.  There are documented cases of growth in men after age 20 though it is not typical.  I would recommend overall health habits, excellent nutrition, and weight training to build strength and muscle.  Try to accept the body you have.  Good health is much more important than height.  And, the overall measure of a man is much more than physical size.  I hope with maturity you will come to be comfortable with this.  I would even recommend some therapy to help your self-esteem.  Also, develop skills, abilities, and interests that will also help your psyche.    Best wishes to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello lmb,  Alcaptonuria is a rare genetic condition where the body is not able to break down phenylalanine or tyrosine (two of the amino acids).  The result is an accumulation of one of the intermediate compounds known as homogentistic acid builds up and is excreted in the urine.  The result is that the urine turns black.  It is generally considered a relatively harmless disease, although the initial reports of the disease describe significant arthritis that occurs with it.  In addition, kidney stones have been reported as well.  The pathway that involves the creation of dopamine is a separate pathway that should not be affected, to my knowledge.  Similarly, it should not interfere with the processing of foods with the exception of breaking down the phenylalanine and tyrosine in the foods.  I am not knowledgeable enough of this disease to comment about the issues with dairy that your husband is having.  You may want to see a geneticist about this.  If possible, seeing a geneticist that specializes in metabolic diseases will likely be able to give you the best information.  Best wishes.  I hope this helps some.\n\n",

    "content": "Please first let me say thank you to anyone taking the time to read this post, especially to those who may have suggestions for me. Also, I apologize for the lengthiness of my story but I truly feel that all of my symptoms are related and am not getting anywhere with the specialists that I'm seeing as they indicate that my symptoms are not related and make me feel like my symptoms are insignificant (though I have lost many months of my life, family and work).  I am a 32 year old female with one 15 year old child (one pregnancy) who has otherwise been healthy until recently. I live(d) a relatively happy, healthy life with minimal stress (considering this stressful world that we live in). I have a wonderful fiance, son, dad and brother - all of whom are helpful, loving, caring and supportive. The good Lord couldn't have blessed me with a better family and support group.  My family history includes:  Mother - Hypoglycemic / Died suddenly at age 39 of Myocardio Infarction w/o any previous symptoms. Cholesterol levels 300+  Father - still living, age 54. High BP Brother - still living, age 28, High BP  Maternal & Paternal Aunts, Uncles, Cousins - High BP  Maternal Aunt - Diabetes  2 Cousins Maternal & Paternal Thyroid Disorders  Paternal Aunt - Still Living - Age 51, MS  Maternal Aunt - Still Living - Age 53, High Cholesterol - At age 40 Myocardio Infarction  Maternal Cousin - Still living - Age 47 - suffering from many similar symptoms as my own for 12 years - undiagnosed   I will start my story backwards.  An MRI on 10/23/07 shows a 1.5 cm multi lobular rounded focus of enhancement within the pituitary gland. The mass extends into the surasellar cistern towards the left and slightly displaces the infundibulum to the right. It comes in close proximity to but does not definately impinge upon the optic chiasm.  The MRI report concludes:  This could represent a pituitary macroadenoma. Other Neoplasic Etiology cannot be excluded (I have no idea what Neoplasic Etiology is).   According to the endocrinologist, (I have yet to see all of my labs), most of my hormones are within normal range, with the exeption of a slight elevation of prolactin (38.8) and cortisol (63.5) - which apparently is nothing to be concerned about. My WBC has continually been elevated ranging from 13,000 - 18,000 - with antibiotics offering little to no decreases. Fasting & non fasting Glucose has also been contiuously low (45 - 54). All thyroid tests are also normal.  ER visit labs have eliminated all common infections diseases & auto immune disorders.  The endocrinologist did say that the mass should be surgically removed - based on the size alone and 'may or may not' be causing many of my symptoms.  A visual field test indicates that there is only a 10% chance that my vision is being affected -- yet I can personally attest to the fact that I am having visual disturbances -- some proof is even see in the scratch & dents on my car during the last few months.  The neurosurgeon has decided against surgery as he feels that the mass is not causing any problems at all and does not explain any of my symptoms (that are below). He did indicate that the mass is abnormally shapped and if the macroadenoma had hemmoraged  at some point, this \"could\" have caused \"some\" of my symptoms. However, if it had hemorraged, it \"should\" be healing and is a once in a lifetime event and I shouldn't ever need to be concerned with it happening again. According to the surgeon, there is nothing that can or should be done at this time, exception for observation with a follow up MRI in three months.  I was told by the endocrinologist and my primary physician that the Neursurgeon is the best in the state of Florida.  I have also seen a rhemotologist who has ruled out any possible rhemetology related conditions. Fibromyalgia hasn't been completely ruled out but can't be diagnosed considering the MRI findings.  My symptoms have changed my entire life and are affecting my family, relationship w/ my fiance, finances & employment. Any suggestions are most helpful.  My symptoms that all continue to date began as follows:  Late '04 Gradual increasing depression. Throughout the last three years, various dosages of Zoloft, Prozac, Welbutrin & Lexepro have offered little to no improvement.  Mid '05 Fatigue begins, worsens as the months pass.  Sept. '06 - rapid weight gain (85+ lbs to date) around this time, extreme fatigue also becomes a factor and continuously worsens.  Poor concentration begins and continuously worsens.  Aug '06 - Allergy/Sinus symptoms appeared for first time in life. Would come on suddenly and disappear just as suddenly.  Began Feb. '07 Headaches that would severely worsen upon bending over.  May '07 - anxiety symptoms begin and have continuously worsed since then to a point that my Fiance has called an ambulance 2x's. Xanex or Ativan offers no relief.  Headaches continue with changing pain symptoms and continue to worsen through July 29th when the worst hit and sent me to the ER. CT was normal. All blood tests normal.  Beginning of Aug. missed menstrual cycle.  Mouth sores and blisters flare up about once per month.  Mid August - Discoloration of hands, resembling Raynaulds Phenomenon  woke up one morning with severe body pain that seemed to resonate throughout my bones, joints, muscles, etc. was unable to fully open right hand (thankfully chiro fixed the hand for me).  To date, my fingers occassionally fail to work properly.  Body pain continues on a regular basis. On a scale of 1-10 pain ranged from 4 - 9, depending on the day. Pain in various parts of body. Initially, the pain would be localized to either the upper half or lower half of body - pain then continued to worsen to affect lower and upper simultaneously. Pain in torso area also began -- lower left back area, right above hip, pelvic area, beneath front right rib.  Pain varies in its signals from day to day ranging from burning, stinging, stabbing, ribbing, brusing, spraining, prickling needles, electrifying shocks.  Short term memory problems begin.  End of August - hands and feet begin to go completely numb following by a tingling sensation and the numbness subsides  Occassional blurred and/or crossing vision. Occassional peripheral vision disturbances also begin.  Early Sept. Extreme mood swings/emotional outbursts  Involuntary muscle movements & twitching throughout body.  Nerve sensitivity when touched.  Complete loss of libido. ( I have always been VERY sexually active & easily satisfied)  End of Sept. Numb face, lips & tounge.  Early Oct - urinary urgency, incontinence & strong smell.  Intense carb cravings.   Inability to feel full after eating.   To date, all of the above symptoms contine and vary in intesity from day to day. I do have some good days lately and have been lucky enough to have a good week here and there but still have a lot of bad days in between.  The rhemetologist recently prescribed Lyrica for the pain and fatigue. It does seem to have helped the fatigue a bit but doesn't seem to do anything for the pain. My primary occassionally will prescribe a week of Lortab for the pain which does help the pain and anxiety tremendously but naturally caution needs to be taken when prescribing narcotics.  If someone could please give me some direction to go in, I would be most grateful. Should I seek additional medical opinions? See other specialists? I really want my old self back again.  Happy Holidays To All.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pituitary Macroadenoma & Abnormal, Undiagnosed Symptoms",
    "content": "Hi, i am sorry for your pain and i just posted about the exact same thing! i have an anterior pituitary microadenoma (.9cm) supposidly non-functioning...i got a book from the Pituitary Network Association called, \"It's All in your Head.\"  i find this answers most but not all of my questions...i am having muscle twitching, cramps and stiffness, burning, numbness, some muscle wasting...i have been to neurosurgeons, cardiologists, endocrinologists and neurosurgeons and still don't have definitive answers. 1.  It's good you know about your P-tumor...many don't and go undiagnosed until the thing bursts... 2. The neurosurgeon doesn't want to do surgery because he may end up taking all of your hormone functions away (this can happen), and it can grow back... 3. Surgery won't take place unless there is an overproduction of GH, ACTH,TSH, ect. or it impinges your optic nerve, or the thing just bursts... 4. Signs to run to the doctor are: can't get out of bed-extreme fatigue really low BP/temp/heart rates - (get a BP monitor and thermonitor and check daily.) irregular menstral cycles severe headache blindness 5. Most P-tumors are prolactemias which causes Weight gain...there are medications for prolactemia. 6. Follow-up is very important to  A gauge growth B hormone function (make sure they check your electrolytes also) i suggest every 4 mos if asymptomatic... 7. Get a surgeon who removes these things all the time...you need someone to know the difference between your tumor and actual pituitary gland...this can save you from taking hormones the rest of your life...all of them! Let's face it, it's gonna happen eventually....so get a good one lined up.  As for the cramping/twitching/neuropathy...well, i have it too and i DO believe it is hormonally induced...i think that your hormones can be fine when they test it, but what about the rest of the times??? non-functioning P tumors does not mean that the P is making enough hormones all the time...you can have Panhypopituitary...and i believe you can have it at variable rates....For instance, when i was brought into the hospital i had no cortisol in me...i was flopping like a fish and thought i had a stroke...the endos did a stim test and found i was making enough ACTH (the hormone the Pituitary sends to stimulate the adrenals)...this is the argument i have with the endos-that i am not always making enough...especially since my BP bottoms out...you can double check with neuro, but i believe the twitches and cramps are hormones and not enough of them...the endo tells me that wouldn't cause twitching but, i'm not so sure. another indication of low cortisol is salt craving, low serum sodium levels (can make you feel like you are dying) low BP, and feeling cold all the time.( i believe my PN is a result of this too...), low resistance to infections and a really hard time getting over them (me) hope this helps and be proactive!!! don't ever take no for an answer or let them tell you it's because you are an emotional hypochondriac-what a cop out for docs- i believe these statements from docs should end in large settlements to patients.......(i've been told my symptoms are conversion LOL)  it is all in your head and it can cause all kinds of problems in your body... as i tell my family doc...it's a wild card in the deck....\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I don't know if this is the right place to post this question but I feel that only an expert in endocrinology can answer it. I have tried about 15 antidepressants and combinations of them with various success. We have tried augmenting strategies with Lithium, Lamictal and Buspiron added to my antidepressants with no success. I have also responded best to AD's that boosts norepinephrine transmission, like nortriptyline, Remeron and Edronax which makes augmenting with T3 an interesting choice since I have read that it (likely) enhances NE and Dopamine transmission. I'm currently taking Edronax(reboxetine) 8mg and Remeron(mirtazapine) 15mg daily for depression, it worked pretty well once but since last spring I have experienced increasing fatigue and decreasing interest/motivation and poor ability to concentrate. Now, there is very limited data on dosing strategies for T3 and T4. Some suggests T3 25-50mcg, but there is an uncertainty for how long and which tests to do, and some suggests T3 should be taken with T4 with different T3:T4 ratios but again hard to find any data how long a treatment should last and safety of treatment. I have taken tests and I'm not hypo- nor hyperthyroid. If I responded to T3, how long should I take it? When I have stopped, how long should I wait before restarting treatment, until depressive/fatigue symptoms reemerge?   Lots of difficult questions, I know. Thanks, Mattias.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Tensor,  As I'm sure you've found, there really isn't much data on this use of thyroid supplement.  There is plenty of data to suggest that hypothyroidism can induce or worsen depression.  It may be worth a try to see if it helps you.  I am not an endocrinologist but I do have some thoughts as to dosing, etc.  I would recommend you start on a low dose, in conjunction with your doctor's advice.   Hyperthyroidism carries its own problems so the goal would be to raise the thyroid level without becoming hypothyroid.  Basically, you may want to try to raise your free T4 to the upper limits of normal while at the same time keeping the TSH normal (so as to not induce hyperthyroidism).  I can't help on how long to use this if it works.  If you choose to try this, follow up with your doctor is crucial.  Best wishes.\n\n",

She has also been having dizziness and heart palps since the memory loss started. Her dr took her off zoloft to see if that was the problem, but to no avail. Isn't it possible that she is not metabolizing the morphine fast enough and is actually overdosing on it? I have heard that morphine and hypothyroidism are contraindicated. Thank you for your help.

    "content": "Hi Alia,  Hypothyroidism does cause a general slowing of the body's metabolism.  This could potentially cause the body to metabolize morphine although I am not completely certain of this.  Symptoms of morphine overdose include pinpoint pupils, excessive sleepiness, constipation and at increasing doses of morphine depressed respirations and ultimately cessation of breathing.  The hypothyroidism itself could cause fatigue and many symptoms similar to morphine overdose since both cause a slowing of the body.  (It would not be expected to cause pinpoint pupils.)  If you are concerned this certainly would be something to discuss with your mother's doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kix6676,  Each lab has different cut offs for \"normals\" with these tests; however, a TSH of 6.3 is generally considered elevated.  Your T4 is likely borderline low.  The T3 may be normal.  Because your T3 is normal your doctor may feel it is a good idea to wait.    If the T3 is actually normal (based on your lab) then this would fit a condition called subclinical hypothyroidism.  In this condition the actual levels of T3 or T4 are normal by lab standards but the body is sensing a need for more (hence the elevated TSH).  In these cases, often the patient may feel better if a small amount of thyroid supplement is taken to bring the TSH back into normal range.  I certainly would never second guess your doctor because all I have is the information you have provided and I cannot examine you so please take the following comment in this light.  If you are symptomatic consistent with hypothyroidism and your TSH is elevated you may wish to consider taking thyroid supplement to see if you feel better.  This would be something to discuss with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

From what I have read on the above medication it has carcinogenic effects in the lab studies.  If taking the spironolactone to stop the effects of the excess hormones, I would be taking the meds until menopause?    Is it better to have the adrenal adenoma removed and let the left adrenal gland take over and produce the hormones needed instead of taking the meds for a long period of time?  thanks for your help.\n\n",

The other perspective is that this is a surgery and there are certainly risks that go along with it.    Taking the spironolactone may help but also is not without its side effects.  My best advice to you is to talk with an endocrinologic surgeon about the procedure.  This way you'll get all the benefits and risks explained to you so you can make an informed decision.

I am afraid that hypothyroid condition (if it is the case) would affect the pregnancy and can cause fetal abnormalities. I would be able to get the test results till next week only.  I am quite concerned about the hypothyroid condition effecting pregnancy if I am pregnant this cycle. Should I start Levoxyl again just to be sure that the fetus is not affected in any case?Your advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ritu74,  I would recommend strongly against starting the levoxyl again.  Based on your initial TSH being only very slightly high with a normal T4, and the fact that your TSH dropped immediately upon beginning the levoxyl I suspect that you were actually never hypothyroid.  The normal level cut offs are based on a bell curve so a small percentage of people will have levels just outside the normals and still actually be normal.  Your symptoms are more concerning for other possible illnesses.  Metformin can cause a rash but I'm not familiar with it causing your other symptoms.  Some rheumatic syndromes can cause these symptoms also.  I would recommend you see your doctor about your symptoms.  At that point you can get your thyroid levels tested again to see if they are now normal since you are off the levoxyl.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Each year my potassium has gotten worse.  About 5 yrs ago they added Spironolactone 25 mg twice a day to help w/potassium.  In the past 6 months my potassium pills have doubled (I now take 12 - 10meq potassium pills a day) we are having difficulty keeping my potassium above the \"low\" normal.

All kidney blood test have come back normal & no signs of diabetes. My blood pressure has remained in control all these years and still is (113/68) give or take a few on each.  I have high cholesterol -238. Not on meds for this. I did not take spironlactone for 3 days (kept forgetting to pick up at pharmacy) I had tingling in hands, legs & face along w/ chest pains) Once the medicine was in my system, all symptoms went away.

    "content": "Hi Dba3mom,  Aldosterone is a hormone in the body that helps increase blood pressure by signalling for increase reabsorption of sodium from the kidneys.  The body must maintain electrical neutrality and sodium is positively charged.  As a response to the increased sodium, potassium (also positively charged) must decrease.  Seeing the kidney specialist is an excellent idea.  The kidney is a huge factor in renin and aldosterone.    Your weakness, etc. may actually be linked to your low potassium levels.  Not taking your spironolactone may have resulted in your potassium levels dropping even more causing your new symptoms.  The kidney specialist can help determine why you are having these problems and recommend some treatments to help get this under control.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Probably what happens is that the patient was susceptible to becoming hypothyroid then the stress of the illness causes increased demand on the thyroid gland, which subsequently fails.  The illness may also trigger antibodies that accidentally also attack the thyroid.  Initially it can be difficult getting the synthroid dose correct.  It may take several adjustments to get the dose so that the TSH is within normal limits.  Continued checking of your TSH periodically will get this adjusted for you.  Once it is set the dose usually is much more stable.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Neenee49,  I have copied and reposted your follow up post here to keep the thread together.  This will allow our readers to be able to follow the information better. You answered a question for me yesterday. Thank you very much. I heard from my Doctors office today and he has changed my diagnosis from hyperthyroidism to Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (Severe)-yet prescribed the same amount of Synthroid I am already taking. I am so sick I did not think to ask the differences in the diagnosis's and why keep me on the same amount of Synthroid-how is this going to help. Please advise.  Hashimoto's Thyroiditis is a condition in which there are antibodies formed that attack the thyroid gland.  Initially, this can cause hyperthyroidism due to the damaged thyroid spilling the stored thyroid hormone into the bloodstream.  Ultimately, almost always with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, eventually hypothyroidism occurs because the thyroid gland has been damaged so much it can no longer make enough thyroid hormone to meet the body's needs.  Interestingly, treatment for hyper/hypothyroidism is almost completely based on the body's TSH levels and not the diagnosis.  If the TSH is low, it means there is too much thyroid hormone (or replacement synthroid) so the body is signaling to make less hormone by decreasing the amount of TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone).  If the thyroid hormone levels are too low, the TSH goes up.  So, even though you now have a diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis the treatment is the same-replace thyroid hormone with synthroid to maintain a normal TSH.  You may find that you are needing to take more synthroid over time as the Hashimoto's completely burns out the thyroid gland and its production of natural thyroid hormone decreases.  Eventually it will stabilize, though.  Usually your thyroid labs will be checked every month or so to see if your dose is correct.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again,  Regarding your cortisol issue, with low normal levels and symptoms that may be consistent with low cortisol you may want to talk with your doctor about having a cortisol stimulation test done to see if your cortisol levels increase appropriately.  You may have a partial deficit that is keeping you from getting enough cortisol to meet your needs.  Often, hashimoto's and grave's disease do run together.  It is reasonable to have other antibodies tested for.  Regardless of the underlying issue with the thyroid, the treatment is basically dictated by how much thyroid hormone is present in the blood.  However, it would be good to know if there is hashimoto's antibodies present because in this disease the thyroid ultimately often burns out and the patient becomes hypothyroid.  In pure Grave's disease, this really doesn't occur so thyroid ablation may ultimately be necessary.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Typically for Grave's disease, thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins (antibodies) are tested for.  This is a generic test that looks at overall thyroid stimulating antibody production rather than looking for one specific antibody.  With hashimoto's disease, thyroid destructive antibodies are evaluated for.  There are many of these, including thyroid peroxidase antibodies, antithryoglobulin antibodies and thyroid receptor blocking antibodies.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

That\u2019s great and everything, but I didn\u2019t really feel any better, so I tried to look for answers on my own and through a sort of an elimination diet found that I do not tolerate oats and other grains, I looked it up and figured that maybe I\u2019m gluten intolerant. I followed a gluten free diet for only 2 weeks and felt  better. But everyone in my family eats gluten containing foods and from time to time I can\u2019t contain myself, I have to have gluten, it\u2019s like  a drug..

    "content": "Hi Soffia,  I'm sorry to hear you are having so much trouble.  There are certainly some things that should be evaluated.  First, I would strongly recommend you have your thyroid levels tested.  Your symptoms are very suspicious of hypothyroidism.    Celiac disease (gluten sensitivity) can certainly make a person feel poorly.  It is a very common disease, perhaps as common as 1 in 100 people are affected with it.  Some people may also simply be a little sensitive to gluten and feel better without it in their diet without having overt celiac disease.  Another possibility would be that you are sleeping very poorly.  Things such as sleep apnea can rob a person of their ability to get a solid nights sleep that leads to excessive sleepiness at night and during the day.  If your thyroid is normal, a sleep study may be helpful to see if any of these sleep disorders are causing problems.  You may also want to consider being tested for viruses such as Ebstein Barr virus (the cause of mononucleosis) that can cause prolonged fatigue.  Following up with your doctor is important to get all this figured out for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The actual range of \"normal\" can vary from lab to lab so the best way to answer this question is to ask your doctor what the range is for your test.  Many labs use a lower cut off of 0.4 for their normal.    I suspect based on your symptoms and the way you are feeling now that you are only a little hyperthyroid.  I would recommend you talk with your doctor about reducing your dose.  Your body is clearly sensing that you have too much thyroid hormone.  The goal will be that you can get your TSH back into the normal range without compromising your feeling well.  There is no danger with breast feeding while taking levothyroxine.  This medicine is very safe and having a bit too much is not a concern for your baby.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Is it hypoglycemia?",
    "content": "Hello, I'm a 30-year old female who has been suffering from dizzy spells and \"blackout\" episodes for almost four months. I was experiencing vertigo in July and a B12 deficiency was found - now I get injections and my B12 is back to normal (and the vertigo went away). Shortly thereafter, I started taking these spells where once or twice per day, my vision fades to black for a few seconds. When it returns, it's grainy and blurred for a few hours. I tremble and shake to the point where I can barely dial the phone and I feel an overwhelming lightheadedness - both symptoms last a couple of hours as well. I have never gone unconcious.  Many of my family members are diabetic and about a year ago, I borrowed my mother's glucose meter because I was experiencing similar symptoms. For about 2 weeks, my sugar readings were anywhere between 4 and 12, but my family doctor refused to look at the results because she was unhappy about me trying to diagnose myself. She told me I didn't have sugar problems and sent me home. She has since asked me not to come back to her with this problem and there are no other family doctors taking patients or offering waiting lists.  I can't live like this. I have a 3-year old son and we are frequently home alone together; I am absolutely petrified that something is going to happen to me - even just fainting - while he is here alone. I haven't been able to drive since the summer and all I do is cry, out of fear and frustration.   I wore a holter monitor overnight last week to rule out an arythmia (which the doctor doesn't think is the problem) and I'm being sent for a CT Scan - all requested by a doctor at an outpatient clinic who just happened to be intrigued by my symptoms.  I tried a glucose meter again for the past couple of weeks and during a few of these blackout episodes, my sugar has been between 3 and 4. I seem to feel best when it's about 6, but it crashes so suddenly that I don't have any warning - sometimes not even enough time to get a glucose pill or juice because I can't see well enough. The problem is that sometimes when this happens, my sugar tests fine, so I'm not sure if hypoglycemia is actually the problem. I feel lightheaded most of the time, a lot of times without any other symptoms.  I was first diagnosed as hypoglycemic during my second pregnancy in 2004. It's been quite manageable and I've always had more than enough time to bring my level back to normal before experiencing any serious symptoms, until the past few months.  I've been referred to an endocriniologist but the wait time in my entire province is between 16 months and 2 years. I haven't been able to complete a glucose test because I can't fast long enough.  I don't know what to do. I'm so scared. Does anyone have any suggestions?  Thanks, Jayne\n\n",

    "title": "PCOS & Hypothyroidism, Pre-diabetes",
    "content": "Right now I have a Kidney Infection, at least that's what the doctor told me.  He gave me 5 days worth of Levaquin and said if I had any more pain to contact him.  Well, of course I'm still having pain and it's been 5 days, so tomorrow I'm going to call him.  Before I talk to him about this, I want a different opinion.    About a month and a half ago I was given a 5 hour blood glucose test.  First (fasting) was normal, 1-3 hours were normal, then my 4th and 5th hour was \"slightly\" elevated, and 5th hour was EXTREMELY low.  My Doctor said this was \"The opposite\" of what diabetes did, so he said in his opinion I didn't have Diabetes.  He did, however, send me to an Endocrinologist a few weeks later, who diagnosed me with PCOS & Hypothyroidism, & said I was \"Pre Diabetic\".    I know PCOS has something to do with Insulin levels, and so does Kidney function correct?  So I'm having all this illness due to 'insulin level', yet I don't have Diabetes?  From the research I've done on my own, most of these things stem from 'prolonged uncontrolled diabetes' yet they say I don't have it.  It's stressing me out because now I'm having some other symptoms that I don't know what they are.  Looking up the symptoms, I see one thing that says they could POSSIBLY be Pancreas related, which really scares me.  Symptoms are: Pain just below the left rib cage (not bad pain, but nagging, pressure, throbbing), dizziness, loss of appetite, stools go from constipation to diarrhea every other day, no regular days.    Any opinions would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "I can direct you to a good site that explains PCOS and includes a quiz to help you decide if you might have it.  http://www.pcosupport.org/medical/whatis.php  I would go through this and see if it makes sense. Insulin resistance is one of the characteristics for sure.  But, it is not the same as diabetes, though some medications to treat it are the same.   The glucose testing you had showed some hypoglycemia.  People can have episodes of  hypoglycemias without an actual diagnosis, especially when it only happens occasionally.  It can be a signal to watch for diabetic symptoms in the future.   I hope your doctor is treating the PCOS.  You could also have other conditions at the same time.  IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) is one of those possibilities since you are experiencing these bowel symptoms.  Don't lose touch with your doctor - keep your appointments to be sure you are getting the right care.  Good luck.\n\n",

I lost the weight easy and felt better than I ever had mentally & physically with the treatment of synthroid. I maintained  a weight between 125-135 for years and lived a normal life. (my height is 5'2, well I am 5'1, I some how managed to lose a whole inch in one year) I belived I had the condition under control until Jan. 2007.  2007 has been terror, I caught chicken pox, had pneumonia twice, had some nasty virus, terrible pain everywhere-my bones hurt and they cant give me enough levothyroxine to even get close to where I am supposed to be. Doc says he doesnt want to raise the levo anymore. In ten months my dose, which for years was 200MCG( between 175 & 250) has went to 350MCG and its not changed my levels this year.  It is almost like my body isn\u2019t absorbing the medicine, it simply quit working. All my original symptoms are back with a vengeance,  weight gain, pain,  I am moody & down, seems like there is more pain now.. I am not exaggerating when I tell you this: I have gone from 133lbs in Jan 2007 to 199lbs in Nov 2007. My thyroid gland is not enlarged, my medication has increased in the last year and my thyroid levels didnt change, which is weird. I follow a routine with my medicine, I have taken it the same way (so I remember) for years. Is it possible that I have a tolerance or is it something bigger?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi AJS,  Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a condition where there your body is making antibodies to the thyroid gland causing it to be destroyed.  When this happens the thyroid gland no longer makes thyroid hormone.  The treatment for this is to take thyroid hormone replacement as you have been doing.  The appropriate amount of thyroid hormone supplement is based on measuring the TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels.  If the TSH is high, the body is trying to stimulate the thyroid gland to make more (indicating a lack of thyroid hormone, or hypothyroid state).  If the TSH is low, the body is sensing too much thyroid hormone and reducing the production of TSH in an attempt to reduce the amount of thyroid hormone.  Some patients will remain on the same amount of thyroid hormone for a long time, others will fluctuate and need adjustments.  If your TSH is high (as I would expect based on your symptoms) you are not getting enough thyroid hormone.  Then the question becomes why.  It may simply be that your body now needs more hormone.  In this case, the answer is to take more, even though you are already taking a high amount.  I would be suspicious that your case may actually be a little different.  You may have a condition that is causing a decreased ability to absorb the levothyroxine.  There are case reports of people developing lactose intolerance or, more commonly, celiac disease that induces a decreased absorption of levothyroxine.  I would recommend you be tested for these conditions as well.  Seeing an endocrinologist is important to help manage your hypothyroidism, particularly since you do not have a straight forward case.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Possible Klinefelter's?",
    "content": "Age: 24, M, 168 lbs 5'8\"ht  In my genetics class in college, I found out about Klinefelters Syndrome. Basically, the reason I believe I may have it is because of a mild case of gynecomastia (the fat under the nipple feels firm with I squeeze my fingers in towards the nipple thus its not normal adipose fat).   First I tried to get into shape (used to be 185, now 166) to burn some fat and I did lose some fat around the chest, but I have the puffy nipples (although not as bad as some pics I've seen).  I don't take ANY drugs. I have some facial hair, but its not full, and very short/thin chest hairs... although I have hairy legs and armpits, on my navel to my pelvis... as well as some hair on my feet and fingers (i'm trying to be specific as possible). I have hips that I believe are a little bit wide, but I do have pretty broad shoulders. My testes aren't that small (measure at about 1.80 inches long). Plus I am not tall (another symptom that KS has but I don't exhibit... I'm an totally confused).  *What could be causing my gynecomastia?*  Also, I am going to get a testosterone check from a private lab (don't want it on my medical record)... would ordering a testosterone serum test be sufficient or should I also get a free testosterone test too?  Thanks for your time!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Anonymous1,  From your description I would not be particularly suspicious of Klinefelters.  As you've suggested, Klinefelters patients are often taller.  They tend to have little body hair and classically have small testes.  Testing for Klinefelters is done by karyotyping from a blood draw.  Gynecomastia is fairly common, particularly in men that were a bit overweight.  The reason for this is that fat cells convert testosterone into estrogen.    As you are loosing weight the gynecomastia will likely improve; however, it may take a while to fully resolve.   Testing of your testosterone levels may or may not give you any helpful information.  A good place to start is with a total testosterone level.  There is probably little need for other hormones at this point.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Current meds - none  Ok, my issue is as follows:-  I like to exercise, my average routine would be say.. go to the gym run a mile, row a mile and do some weights.  For the first hour or so I feel fantastic.  However, as the day goes on a similar pattern occurs.   Several hours later I start to feel extremely low, excessively hungry, my mind starts to feel numb and can't think straight, I feel headachy, irritable, shaky and anxious.  I find myself gritting my teeth and my eyes feel tired and droopy.  Obviously I eat afterwards to combat the feeling of hunger.. this alleviates the feeling of shakiness slightly but doesn't really help the numb feeling in my mind.  These symptoms continue for the rest of the day, and almost always lead to a very disturbed night's sleep where I feel like I can't switch off, I wake up frequently feeling exhausted and extemely hungry.   The symptoms continue for the next day.  I love to do exercise, it makes me feel great physically, but as for the way it affects my mood.. I find I have to organise my life around it.  In particular if I have to study that afternoon.. I avoid doing any exercise like the plague!  I've visited my doctor twice about this issue (2 different doctors), they've both suspected something like hypoglycaemia and have given me blood tests and have told me both times that nothing seems to be amiss with the results.  As a medical student myself I'm searching through all my books/internet sites trying to understand what could be causing it but I'm really not sure.  Please can you give me some advice on what to do.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear penkapchew, On the surface without having lab work to consider, it does indeed sound like you are having bouts of hypoglycemia.  It would be of value to get a chemistry run (standard BMP- basic metabolic profile), to check your basic chemistry balance/imbalance;   and even a HbA1c (glycolsylated hemoglobin - or hemoglobin A1c) which would tell your PMD your rolling average for blood sugars over a 3 month period of time.  If indeed you are hypoglycemic, there are things you can do to combat the uncomfortable side effects, but it would be of value to verify that this is indeed the condition, rather than simply fight the symptoms blindly.  They may be indicators of other underlying problems that have the potential to be even more serious if not addressed.  Please ask your PMD to run some basic lab tests, and to further advise you based on those results.\n\n",

    "title": "Remarkably similar symptoms - did you get anywhere?",
    "content": "Hi there   I've just come across your previous message. Strangely I suffer very similar symptoms to yourself.   Whenever I do light jogging or cycling I have no negative reaction, but when I do anything involving resistance eg weight training or heavy cycling, I feel great for a few hours, then briefly I feel sleepy, then after that I become irritable and stressed for no apparent reason for the next 3 or 4 days. I also sleep very poorly for those days as well and feel really sluggish and lethargic. I don't have hunger pangs as such but I do find myself eating more than usual.   Just wondering, did you get anywhere with your tests/doctor? My doctor is sending me off to a sports clinic but, judging by the clinic's website, I'm not convinced they'll be able to help.   I've thought for a while that the problem could be with my endocrine system, I've had a standard blood test (which looked for probems with my thyroid, for example) but it didn't show anything unusual. Mind you, I had that test on a normal day, not after doing resistance exercise.  Anyway, it would be really good to hear from you, or anyone that can offer some help for this really frustrating problem. I'm supposed to be doing knee strengthening exsercises following a cartilage operation but I can't due to this reaction to resistance exercise.  Kind regards\n\n",

I've now had the basic endocrine and blood tests done and they've come back ok.

    "content": "Hi Fairycakes,  This can be a difficult issue.  Unfortunately, endocrinology tends to be a busy field so often endocrinologists will choose their favorite issues and only see those because they don't have enough time to see anything else.  Probably the best thing to do is keep calling endocrinologists in your area.  If you are unable to find one that deals with these issues you may want to try explaining your situation (that you cannot find an endocrinologist willing to see you) and see if one will make an exception for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am sending this in regards to my 19 year old daughter. In the last year she has lost 32 pounds and her blood pressure is higher than usual. She is athletic and had a physical every year for the last 5 years. This is the first year she has had any issues. She is 6\"1 and now weighs 156 pounds. Among other symtoms, she is very pale, sometimes clamy and had a problem sleeping for a while. She went to the Doctor and had some lab test done as I thought this issue might be related to a hyperthyroid. Her test results came in and her glucose level shows as 35 mg/dL. (Normal range should be 65-99 mg/Dl). Her  T-4 Free is 1.3 and her TSH is 1.49. In the lab results for the glucose the following message appears:  Red Blood cells were present in the sample upon receipt in the laboratory. The test ordered were performed. The presence of red blood cells has been known to affect the following analytes: Potassium, Glucose, Inorganic Phosphorus, Lactate Dehydrogenase and Iron. Verified by repeat Analysis.  The doctor indicated that the lab results were within normal limits. Should I be concerned with the glucose level and request this test be completed again and if the issue is not related to her thyroid, what else should I have her checked for? I am very concerned. Please help.  Thank you,  Tinker3168\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Tinker3168,  I would be quite concerned about a glucose level of 35.  Anything less than 50 is suspicious.  There are several other hormonal tests that should be evaluated.  Low blood sugars such as this can indicate a hormone deficiency such as a growth hormone deficiency, cortisol deficiency or possibly a hyperinsulin state.  I would recommend she see an endocrinologist for further evaluation.  It may be necessary to do a fasting glucose evaluation where the patient is kept without eating to see if the blood sugars drop.  The hard part about these types of diseases is that the labs really need to be drawn when the blood sugar is low so it is important the evaluation be done in a controlled setting where the blood sugar can be monitored closely, the labs drawn quickly if the level is low and then the blood sugar can be corrected rapidly.  I would not expect the presence of red blood cells to affect the thyroid studies.  Hearing her case initially made me think of hyperthyroidism although it does not seem that this is present based on the normal TSH level.  Again, follow with her doctor is very important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Over the past few years I have ever increasing muscle pain.  Changing the amount of Armour I am on does not seem to make any difference regarding the pain.  Fatigue is very easy to achieve and recovery time is very long.  Any type of excercise is painful.  I really need some advice on a good Dr in the North Jersey-NY-NY area.  I have three children who I want to be able to do much more with than watch TV over the coming years.  Any help or advice would be extremely appreciated.  First of all the family Dr I use is no expert in my condition but he has been pretty good. After looking at all my labs I feel he may have not been looking at the big picture regarding the Hashi.  Today I had blood and urine samples taken and he is having all the tests I requested plus some he thought might show something. He finally agrees that something other then just the thyroid must be going on because of the pain/numbness and loss of strength.  I will start with the latest and work back to the beginning.

Maybe it's not that high but it is consistently out of range the past few years meaning something is going on with my liver.  It's also interesting to note that I am actually needing less Thyroid meds to get things in range.  From the looks of the results I need have a decrease in my dosage again.  Thanks for your answers in advance  Bob\n\n",

    "content": "Based on your lab work it does appear that you probably need less thyroid medicine.  However, your TSH is normal.  This really is the best indicator of thyroid levels.  If your body is sensing that you are too high or too low the TSH will react dramatically.  Since your TSH is normal I suspect that you are actually only very slightly high on your thyroid or even normal.  Remember that the normal levels are bell curves and a small percentage of people will be normal even though they are outside the range.  Your fatigue is actually more consistent with hypothyroidism.  The muscle weakness can be associated with hyperthyroidism.  Your diagnosis of hashimoto's thyroiditis fits the antibody profile that you have had.  Unfortunately, I cannot be of help in recommending a doctor in your area.  I am not familiar with any.  I would strongly recommend you see an endocrinologist to help get things leveled out for you.

    "content": "Hi, I am a 32 year old woman with 2 children who were conceived on the first try for each of them. Six month ago we starting trying to have our 3rd. I got pregnant right away again and my HCG levels initially increased approprately but then slowed down and my progesterone was low. I lost the pregnancy at 6 weeks. About a year and a half ago, a while after having my second child, some major changes happened all at once in my body.  My eyes became extremely dry, and I also experienced vaginal dryness, my periods became irregular and I had a lot of spotting, my good cholesterol, which has always been very good, became low, and I also started to feel irritable. My doctor felt some of this was due to low hormones. I mentioned this to my OB after the loss and so they did a progesterone test on a normal cycle for me and it was 8 at 10 dpo. So the next month they put me on prometrium and I did not get pregnant despite trying and my progesterone was still 8 at 10 dpo.  This month my doctor is having me try suppositories and not try to get pregnant until we get the results. I have read about LPD and I know there is some debate about whether low progesterone is the real issue. My question is whether I ought to have further blood tests done to test other hormones or if just focusing on the progesterone is enough? Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I would say this is the most likely hormone concern but has your doctor also checked your thyroid function?  Since it is a master gland, other hormones are affected if you don't have adequate thyroid levels and hypothyroidism is very common but often undetected.  I'm sorry but I am not familiar with LPD in this context.  Perhaps you can expound on that.    There are hundreds of studies going on right now involving progesterone and pregnancy loss.  As you have said, the jury's still out but it doesn't seem to hurt and I have seen many cases where a woman treated with progesterone after multiple losses was able to carry to term.    Aside from the thyroid and what your doctor is already doing, I don't know what more might be helpful.  Unfortunately lab work, while an important part, is not the whole picture and we can't get all the answers through blood analysis.  At best it is a clue to help the doctor determine the cause of the problem.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am currently 37 years old, 18 weeks pregnant, and am a hypothyroid patient who takes Synthroid.  Prior to conception and during my first trimester, I took Synthroid (75mcg) but my thyroid condition was not managed properly.  My TSH level 2 months prior to conception was 3.5.  At 6 weeks of pregnancy, my TSH was 5.3.  Unfortunately, this was not discovered until week 13 of pregnancy at which point my Synthroid dose was increased.  TSH levels after 2 days on the new dose was ~2.  I am now being monitored by an endocrinologist.  I would like to know what risks my baby has as a result of my thyroid mismanagement (I understand there could be developmental/cognitive delays?).  I would also like to know about how high my TSH levels may have risen tin the 7 weeks that I wasn't being properly managed.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Shb6,  This is a little bit of a difficult question to answer.  We still don't fully understand the effects of hypothyroidism early in pregnancy.  Starting around the first part of the second trimester the baby's thyroid will begin making its own thyroid hormone.  At that point, the baby is less dependent on mom's thyroid hormone.  It is very common for women to need more thyroid hormone during pregnancy and your levels should be monitored periodically.  I suspect that your baby will be fine given that you were taking some thyroid hormone and your TSH level had not risen dramatically out of range.  TSH is very sensitive so a very small increase in demand for thyroid hormone will cause a significant increase in TSH.  Given this I suspect your actual thyroid levels were very minimally low and not low enough to cause much problem.  Unfortunately I can't make a guarantee on this but I think your baby will be just fine.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ritu74,  TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) is the most sensitive measure of the bodies balance of thyroid hormone.  If TSH is high the body needs more.  If it's low the body has too much.  In your case, your initial free T4 was normal and the TSH was only very slightly elevated.  This would indicate a condition called subclinical hypothyroidism.  Many endocrinologists now are recommending treatment of this condition with thyroid hormone because they've found that people feel better even though they didn't really feel bad before.  Your TSH was so close to normal I would likely have simply repeated the tests in a few weeks to see if it was normal.  However, starting medications is also reasonable.    Reducing your dose after the second set of tests was appropriate.  At that point you were clearly getting too much thyroid hormone as your TSH was low.  You should have your levels checked again in 2-4 weeks on this dose to see if this one is correct.  You may want to talk with your doctor about stopping the medicine to see if your levels stay normal.  However, do not stop the medicine on your own.  This should only be done in consultation with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My TSH at the time of diagnosis was at 7.54, and so my primary put me on 25 micrograms of levothyroxin.  This past week I visited my primary for my two month follow up and my blood tests revealed that my TSH is now in the normal range at 2.25.  My doctor was pleased with the test results and wants me to continue at the 25 microgram strength. I am to see him again in about 3 to 4 months.  Anyway... while I am now feeling really good (lots of physical energy, less aches and pains, etc ), the medicine is causing me to have severe insomnia.   It seems that while I have no trouble falling asleep, I can only stay asleep for 3 -  4 hours before I am wide awake again.  When this happens, getting back to sleep is next to impossible.  This insomnia will last for approx. 5 to 8 nights before I am able to sleep one night for a full 8 hours.  Then the insomnia starts back up again.  I told my doctor about this issue but he wants me to continue with the medicine.  So my questions to the board are the following:  1. How long will it take for my my body to adapt to this medication?   2. I take this med in the morning approx 1 hour before breakfast, should I try taking it in the afternoon or evening?  Thanks,  Cricket\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Charlottestevens,  Laron syndrome is a condition where the body is unresponsive to growth hormone.  There can be several reasons for this.  Primary resistance is when growth hormone simply cannot activate the hormone receptor (often by a mutation in the receptor).  This is the classic Laron Syndrome.  Secondary resistance is when there is some other compound (such as an antibody) that is interfering with the interaction of the growth hormone and receptor.  One of the primary ways that growth hormone acts is to stimulate release of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).  Treatment can be to give recombinant IGF-1.  This can result in increased growth velocity and height.  Laron syndrome is an autosomal recessive inheritance.  At this point, the exact frequency is not well known although the syndrome is not very common.  It is mainly found in those of Jewish or Arabic descent but has been described in others.  It is important that your child follow up with a pediatric endocrinologist to help manage this syndrome.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Your post subject refers to iodine deficiency which can lead to hypothyroidism.  I would recommend you have your thyroid levels tested.  It is a simple test and a fixable problem if hypothyroidism is present.  Depression can cause some of these symptoms also so if this is currently an issue, treating the depression may help.

Male, no serious illnesses past or present, had 2 general anaesthesias (sp?) and one or two local ones for various bumps/breaks  No family history of anything horrible, except of course heart attacks.  I had whooping cough for a good few months when I was 2. (I remember it quite well and I swear it made me autistic or something, one night I remember I coughed so hard I sort of felt something tense and break in the front of my brain, it didnt hurt, but I felt sort of mentally numb afterwards, any thoughts on that would be welcome)  No current medication, unless you count beechams throat lozenges.  So, basically I am depressed most of the time, maybe because im smart, maybe because im stupid, maybe because my life is boring, or maybe because I am boring.... that doesnt actually bother me at the moment... what is really interesting to me is the fact that once every 2 or 3 years i get a cold.  And whenever I do, for 2, 3 maybe even 4 days if I'm lucky, my depression *completely* lifts.  I've tried different diets and all sorts of things to improve my life, some things help, some things don't, the only thing that truly makes me feel *completely* healthy and content is my body winning the fight against the common cold. (I think I had the flu once and that made me feel good too).  Is there any interesting medical explanation for that?  Am I addicted to throat lozenges?  Do I associate having a cold with time off work/school? (hence making me feel happy)  Hopefully it's none of those things, and hopefully it has an interesting explanation, and hopefully that interesting explanation won't make me look too silly.  Please be creative in your responses and bare in mind that if possible I would like to recreate \"feeling completely healthy\" if possible.  And hopefully my dry sense of humour will go down well with you medical people!  Thanks in advance Kevin\n\n",

I agree, my immune response cures my depression, which begs the question; what on earth is wrong with me?  I would like to know more about how the body fights infection.  What does the body do? How does it change?  What do these changes effect?  And how could this combine to make me feel as I should be feeling in the first instance?  Could I be addicted to illness? Addicted to my own immune response?  Maybe I have munchausens.  Maybe I'm just bored.  Ok I'm not just bored, but I am bored.  Interlude: Creditibility has reached zero. End of interlude.

A little over a month ago I discovered a small lump under my left armpit. My immediate thoughts were that it was an infected lymph node, as I have had them before in the neck and face, and that it was nothing to worry about. I went to the doctor anyway and he gave me some antibiotics (Keflex). I took them, but it didn't go away. I examined the lump for myself, more indepth, only to find that it literally feels like its right under the skin. It moves when I move my skin, it is not stationary. It's very soft and does not hurt. There is no other swelling around the skin and there is no irritation. MY appetite and weight are fine, in fact I have actually gained weight since I found it. I have had some family members with cancer, but no immediate family. Is this even a lymph node?? If it's not, then what is it? Should I be concerned?\n\n",

From your description, if it is a lymph node, it does not sound abnormal.  Another possibility is a lipoma.  This is a non-cancerous fat cell tumor that generally does not need treatment.  If it becomes painful or continues enlarging, a lipoma can be removed by a simple surgery.  I would recommend you have your doctor evaluate this when you are in for your next check up.

But even if that is the diagnosis, I have been informed that generally treatment is not done for males with this.  I have another appointment with my endocrinologist on the 4th of September.

My past medical history is as follows:  Psoriatic Arthritis (methotrexate- 5 tabs wkly)  Ulcerative Colitis(Asacol), Hypothyroidism (recent), Latex Allergy (I mention this as many of my problems seem to be with my immune system), Fibromyalgia.  About 8 months ago, I was becoming increasingly fatigued, along with joint pain, memory loss, and weight gain.  My Rheumatologist suspected thyroid problems, so she took thyroid funcion tests.  Both my FT4 and my TSH came back low.  To try and condense this, rechecks confirmed this.  The most recent results are:  TSH 0.470 (0.4-4.2)                              FT4 0.5     (0.8-1.9)  A Free T4 Eq Dialysis was drawn at the same time with the results   0.8  (0.8-2.7)  I am now on Synthyroid, but my Endo followed up with other testing.  My Pituitary MRI was normal - \"anterior pituitary small but within normal limits\".  The other labs are towards the low side (i.e Cortisol was 8.1 (8-25).  One concern is that these labs were not AM draws, so they may not be accurate.  My  ICD diagnosis  read \"Panhypopituitarism\", but I do not think anything has been confirmed yet.  I have an unusual family history; my father died of breast cancer, and all 5 of my siblings have or had autoimmune diseases. (Two of my siblings have passed away).  I used to feel pretty healthy, but in the last 5 years or so, I become ill easily and seem to catch everything going around.    What is the possibility that I do have panhypopituitarism?  What  other testing should be done?  Also, my PCP put me on thyroid medicine prior to me seeing the Endo Specialist.  After 6 weeks on it, my TSH had dropped to 0.028 (0.4-4.2) and my FT4 had only risen to 0.7 (0.8-1.9).  It seems as if I need to be on a stronger dose, but wouldn't that completely shut down the TSH?   My Endo had me restart the medication and I am to see her again after  I have been on it for 6 weeks.  Whew!  I know that this is long, and thank you to anyone who has stayed with me thus far!  Any comments from anyone as to what might be going on with me?  Thanks!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  I am not a medical professional, but I am panhypopituitary and have been for 6 years.  Your low TSH in combination with your low FT4 does indicate a pituitary problem.  At this point, the value of your TSH becomes meaningless and the goal is get your FT4 and (AND!) FT3 into the upper 1/3 of the normal ranges.  Since this is a pituitary situation, I would speak to your doctors about testing all your pitutiary function hormones:  DHEA, testosterone, FSH, LH, estradiol, IGF-1 (initial growth hormone test), a.m. and p.m. cortisol.  With these test results, you can see a pattern.  If IGF-1 is low or low-normal, a growth hormone stimulation test should be done.  If cortisol is low, an ACTH (the hormone the pituitary produces to stimulate the adrenals to produce cortisol) should be done.  Here is my personal caveat about stimulation tests:  If an artifical substance can be introduced into the body to stimulate the pituitary to produce a hormone, how does anyone know that the pituitary will produce that same result when left to its own functioning?  An endocrinologist that is very experienced with pituitary issues should be seen.\n\n",

I started with a rare disease back in 1995, Cushing's disease by way of pituitary tumor, then as a result of surgery became panhypopituitary.  Doctor's often have limited knowledge about rare diseases, sometimes by choice, maybe because they don't see many of us type people.    Getting diagnosed with Cushings, and then Panhypopituitary, was on my own.  I knew my body was going wrong, and doctors kept telling me all my tests were \"normal\" and maybe I needed psychiatric help.  So I had to research.  Physician's Guide for Rare Disorders helped me alot (reference book in libraries).  And now the internet.  Online support groups are crucial, but you know the cautions about them.  Yahoo Groups, I believe, has a hypopituitary group.    Here is a site with a great overview of pituitary issues.  http://www.pituitary.org/    They miss telling female hypopits that testosterone replacement is being done now.  I use Androgel.    Also, when you have a doctor's visit and/or labs done, you must get copies so you can get a feel for results and learn terminology.  Doctors can be dismissive of patients, but less so when you are knowledgable.  Good luck!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am not one of the Medical Professionals on this site, but I have some questions for you regarding your clinical history.  You state that you have Raynaud's as well as osteoartritis, chronic fatigue and fibro. Raynaud's is an autoimmune disease. I am not certain if your Cushings is autoimmune- sometimes it can be.  My question: Has your physician considered that you have some sort of Rhuematic disease rather than FMS and CFS.   The reason I am asking is that fatigue is a major component of auto immune arthritis. When Cytokines are elevated, fatigue can be overwhelming and intense. There are many types of autoimmune arthritis: Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Myositis, Reactive Arthritis, Behcet's Disease..and that is only to name a few.  FMS does have the pain and fatigue component, but it will not have elevated inflammatory markers. Sedrate and C-Reactive Protien come to mind. The second is much more sensitive.  The fact that you have at least one AI disease, leads me to believe that your medical team should consider an alternative diagnosis.  There are many new and excellent treatments for autoimmune arthritis-they can give you your life back.  My last two questions: what other hormone replacement do you take and what is the dosage of Androgel.  Regards, radgal\n\n",

An AI condition has also come to the front of my mind recently, especiallly as my GP diagnosed me with osteoarthritis.  This is too \"catch all\" and I have an appointment with a rheumatologist in a few weeks.  I am concerned about how AI conditions can be accurately tested for me, as I am on steroids (prednisone and hydrocortisone) for the adrenal insufficiency, and prednisone has a carry-over effect from day to day.  I use 1/5th of a 5 gm packette of Androgel, rubbed on my shoulders each day.  I squeeze a full packette of Androgel into a needle-less syringe (12cc), and a 5gm packette equals 5cc's.  This way I can dose out an accurate 1cc a day.  This has worked well for me for 6 years.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Please don't confuse osteo arthritis with auto immune arthritis-they are extremely different.  Even though you take prednisone, your MD will be able to test for inflammatory markers. At a minimum a Sedrate and C-Reactive Protien, a CBC panel, Rheumatoid factor, CPK, ANA should also be condsidered.   Research!!!! Google Autoimmune arthritis. There will be many different types. Check the symptoms-there may be other things going on inyour body that could be related to AI arthritis.  Check out a few online support groups. Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis and Myositis sufferers have large online groups. The members can be extremely helpful and supportive.  Don't give up. Remember FMS is way over diagnosed-inexperienced doctors often 'label' these patients without proper ongoing diagnostics. Sometimes these diseases take a while to become full blown-blood work isn't always positive; at the beginning the inflammation can come and go.  Good luck. let me know how you make out.

    "content": "Hi Bobsun,  High levels of iodine can inhibit thyroid production from a thyroid gland that could then begin working properly again when the iodine levels fall.  It would take a significant amount of iodine to do this though.  I'm not familiar with the iodine disinfection you are referring to.  It if was just the iodine put on the umbilical cord this would not be enough to do this.  Typically congenital hypothyroidism would not be expected to suddenly become hyperthyroid.  One possible, and most likely, explanation for this is that your baby is now getting too much thyroid hormone.  I would recommend you continue to follow up with your baby's endocrinologist to adjust the thyroid supplementation so that proper levels are maintained.  Best wishes.\n\n",

With PCOS, the LH:FSH ratio (typically about 1:1) will be elevated to about 2-3:1 or even higher.  Prolactin should also be tested to be sure it isn't an elevation of prolactin causing your problems.  Hirsutism is not necessarily required for the diagnosis, nor are cystic ovaries.  Seeing your OB is a good place to start.  If your OB has trouble an endocrinologist will be appropriate.  Bets wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Explorer,  The vast majority of thyroid nodules are not cancerous.  Some may be making thyroid hormone causing hyperthyroidism so even though they are benign (not cancer) they still may need to be removed.  Others do not produce hormone (known as a cold nodule, as opposed to a hot, hormone producing nodule).  Having said that, depending on the study you look at, about 10% of larger nodules will turn out to be cancerous.  Your wife's node may be considered large or may not (depending, again, on the study used).    Some would advocate doing a fine needle biopsy of the nodule to see if there is any cancerous signs in it.    I would recommend she discuss with her doctor the possibility of having the biopsy done.  Again, though, around 90% of these will end up being non-cancerous so the odds are in your favor.  10% is still large enough that many physicians will pursue a more agressive work up.    Unfortunately, the data is still a bit mixed in studies so this aggressive approach may not actually be the best way to go.  More research is needed to be more certain.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kimbers25,  Essentially all your studies are normal.  In particular, your TSH and T4 are normal, making the thyroid unlikely to be causing your symptoms.  The TPO (or thyroid peroxidase) antibodies are antibodies against the thyroid gland.  If they are elevated enough they can damage the thyroid gland causing an autoimmune thyroiditis.  Your levels are not particularly concerning although it may be useful to test them again in several months.  Unfortunately, based on these tests you have not found the cause of your symptoms.  I would recommend you continue to follow up with your doctor for further evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 24 year old healthy female. I have been put on Spironolactone and Yasmin for what the endocrinologist believes is a mild case of polycystic ovarian syndrome. I have facial hair on my neck, and have more acne than is usual for someone my age. I read on the medication information that the combination of these two medications could heighten my potassium to possibly unhealthy levels. I also drink a lot of grapefruit juice, which contains a lot of potassium. Am I on the road to dangerously high potassium levels? What are signs of potassium toxicity?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I am not a doctor, but I thought I would give you the tidbits that I know.  The recommended daily allowance for potassium is 3500 milligrams. So you might start looking at your intake (the best you can).  The symptoms are generally Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, irregular heartbeat, muscle weakness, and fatigue.   Elevated blood levels of potassium can be toxic, and may cause an irregular heartbeat or even heart attack. Under most circumstances, the body maintains blood levels of potassium within a tight range, so it is not usually possible to produce symptoms of toxicity through intake of potassium-containing foods and/or supplements.However, high intakes of potassium salts (potassium chloride and potassium bicarbonate) may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or ulcers.   In addition, the kidneys play an important role in eliminating excess potassium from the body, so if you suffer from kidney disease, you must severely limit your intake of potassium. To date, the National Academy of Sciences has not established a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for potassium.   I don't know anything about the medicines you are taking but if it were me I would talk to my doctor about not taking them together.   The following medications may cause an increase in blood levels of potassium:  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as quinapril, ramipril, enalapril, captopril, are used to treat high blood pressure. These medications may increase potassium levels, especially when taken by individuals with kidney disease.  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen (Advil) and indomethacin, may cause an increase in blood levels of potassium by damaging the kidneys.  Heparin, an anticoagulant prescription medication used to prevent blood clots after surgery, may increase potassium levels.  Sulfonamide antibiotics may increase potassium levels, especially when taken by individuals with kidney disease.  And in the meantime you might want to cut down or out the grapefruit juice/bananas and other things really high in potassium. :)  Good luck to you!\n\n",

Treatment is essentially to replace the thyroid hormone using thyroxine.  Generally the synthetic thyroxines work well.  Some people use thyroxine from bovine or other sources.     Levels should be titrated upward until the TSH level becomes normal.    I'm not sure if this answers your question or not.  Please feel free to post a follow up if needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 38 year old woman.  In December of 06 I began to experience a series of panic attacks, a few in one day for a while which whittled away to general anxiety and has gone away.  While this happened I dropped about 8 pounds within days.  Since then I have gone in the opposite direction. I have put back on the weight in addition to another almost 10lbs, despite a good diet with regular exercise.  I've actually been dieting and stepped up exercise cannot lose anything.  I have never had this problem before and have always led a very active life.  I am also tired and weak, something again, I have never felt before.  I seem to constantly have muscle pains in my shoulders and chest.  I frequently experience chest tightness.  I've had an EKG and echo and my heart is fine.  I also have the feeling of a lump in my throat.  One dr I visited said my thyroid was enlarged, a sonogram was ordered and it was confirmed normal.  My GP ran thyroid tests and I had high thryroid antibodies, both thyroid peroxidase and thyroglulin ab.  My TSH was 1.18.  In the past, normal TSH for me has been around .635.  My doctor recommended I see a endo because he felt that this might be the cause of all of my problems.  It should also be noted that since December 06, I have had numerous drug allergies (even to drugs I have taken with no problem before) and the doctor thinks that it is related.  I saw one doctor who put me on 15mg of Armour.  The endo said this was a pediatric dose but to take it if I felt better and ran yet more tests.  The tsh was still around 1.18 and he told me NOT to take the armour.  I am so confused as to what I am supposed to do at this point.  I do NOT feel well or anywhere near like my old self.  Some dr's treat antibodies, some do not.  I am tired of feeling awful and do not know what to do.  Two GP's told me that I am on my way to hypothryroid while the endo told me that just because I have antibodies doesen't mean I'll go hypo.  I FEEL hypo already.  What is the proper treatment after all?  If anyone can help, it would be GREATLY appreciated.  Misty\n\n",

As far as I know, you don't treat an antibody rise. However, the rationale of your doctor is that you are symptomatic and he believes this warrants treatment.

Pheochromocytomas are quite rare.  I would have expected your urine levels of normetanephrine to be higher with a pheo.  Your plasma creatinine should really be considered normal even though technically outside the normal range.  The calcium level is only slightly low.  I suspect if you were to check an ionized calcium level (the bioactive form) it would be normal.  Cortisol fluctuates significantly during the day.  It is best to have it tested early in the morning when more standard normals have been determined.  Even with this, your level is not particularly high.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  If there is concern about your heart a stress test and ultrasound are appropriate.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I had my uterus only out in 2004. 1 yr later my TSH-HS level was 2.28. Every so often I get a \"flutter\" in throat in last 2 yrs. Mostly when I overexert. Been really tired, achey, cold or fever, etc... Mar/April this yr.  Got blood work done 5/07, all looks good except TSH level is 6.24 & trigly. & cholest. are up too.  ND Dr. started me on 60 mg of Westhroid\u2122 - 1 per am.    http://www.wes-throid.com/ingredients.asp (Thyroid USP Tablet is a full prescription, officially monographed United States Pharmacopeia meds for treatment of hypothyroidism. They are natural preparations derived from porcine thyroid glands (T3 liothyronine is approximately four times as potent as T4 levothyroxine on a microgram for microgram basis) and provide standardized, guaranteed potency of 38 mcg levothyroxine (T4) and 9 mcg liothyronine (T3) for each 65 mg (1 Grain) of the labeled content of thyroid.) I took 60 mg.  Also did saliva test for Adrenal 1 week later. 1 week after that got results. It is VERY low all day until it kicks in a small amount in evening.  Started taking Vital Nutrients Adrenal Support 2 per morning.       http://www.vitalnutrients.net (contains per 2 caps: Adrenal (whole) Bovine- 300mg Adrenal (cortex) Bovine\t150mg Eleuthro Extract 28:1(Eleuth.senticosus) - 200mg Ashwaganda Extract 5:1\t- 200mg Cordyceps sinensis Extract 4:1- 100mg Pantothenic Acid- 100mg)  About 4 days into that I started having these flutters in my neck & upper chest often. Got worse at night in bed. Felt like it's hard to catch my breath. Feels like a bird flapping around. Dr. said to stop thyroid med for 3 days & see if gets better - may have to go down to 1/2 dose. I am very sensitive. Still took adrenal meds. 2+3 days later the flutters are so constant & all day long, they scare my husband who listens with his stethoscope (used to be resp. therapist) & hears missed heartbeats & extra beats. Takes me to ER on Wed. EKG shows same, oxygen is fine. Blood test show TSH at 3.6. I stopped all meds that day up til now - 5 days later. The flutters have almost completely stopped. Only 1-2 times this am. 2 this eve.  I wonder if I am too sensitive for the meds. Maybe should take synthetics? Or just smaller doses? What will an endo Dr do or say different? Are there other tests that should be run? I felt pretty paniced at hospital cuz I hate needles, etc... so Dr gave me Ativan in IV & extra pill- 1 mg,  for that night & more for at home, in case... Took 1 per day for 3 days but stopped after that.  Should I try thyroid pill 1/2 dose by itself for a few days & see if it comes back then try adrenal pills? Just to see which one if either are causing this?  I don't what to do at this point. Any suggestions will help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Whattodo43,  I would strongly advise you to see an endocrinologist.  The thyroid and the adrenal glands can have very significant effects on the body.  It is important to be sure that when taking medications that affect them the levels of these medications are closely monitored.  Generally, I recommend using synthetic thyroid hormone (T4).  The natural hormonal preparations are fine but I feel the synthetic is easier to control and has a few less side effects (generally).  Really, though, the key is to monitor levels of TSH when using these medicines.  This is the key to being sure that your body is getting the correct amount.  Also, I generally recommend using T4 as opposed to T3 because T3 is the more active (potent) form of thyroid hormone.  When the body has too much T4 it can shunt some to rT3 that is inactive.  It cannot do this with T3 as easily.  Too much thyroid hormone can most definitely cause the fluttery feelings you were experiencing.  Unfortunately I am not familiar with the data on using supplements for the adrenal gland.  Again, I tend to be opposed to using supplements because they are generally not regulated and one is never absolutely certain what is actually in them, unlike a prescription medicine that is tightly regulated.  An endocrinologist can help be sure you are getting the correct medicine dosing as well as the best medicines for your situation.  In addition, the most important role would be to help follow you long term to make sure your hormone levels return to normal.  I hope this doesn't sound like a lecture or me trying to correct you or your doctors.  That is definitely not my intention.  I simply wish to convey that these glands can be dangerous if not monitored closely.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Paradox of endocrinology symptoms",
    "content": "I am a 34 year old female currently experiencing many conflicting symptoms thought to be related to the thyroid gland.  Doctors have failed to provide a definitive diagnosis or treatment over the past 2 years.  I will give a breif history of all health issues, past and present, because I have no idea what is related and what isn't.  Since the age of 15, have continually experienced occasional \"shock\" pains in the chest that lasted from 1-3 seconds.  At age 18, diagnosed with boderline high cholesterol - total level just under 200.  From that time on, cholesterol varied from 190 - 225 while on a low cholesterol diet, no medication.  Never maintained a normal menstrual cycle, with only 2-4 menstrual periods each year.  Periods were extremely heavy lasting 9-11 days.  Periods continued to be heavy and long even on birth control pills which created a period every month.  Diagnosed with asthma in 1995, thought to be cause of strange chest pains.  Gallbladder removed in 2003 - no gallstones present, but gallbladder stopped functioning and began to turn gangrene.  Five feet tall and have maintained a weight between 100-115.  In October, 2005, began having chest pains and pain and numbness in left arm.  After series of tests, no cause was found for chest pains, numbness and pain in arm was attributed to medial epicondylitis which was present in both arms.  During a follow-up cardiac stress test, resting heart rate was 130 bpm.  Cardiologist dismissed high rate due to dehydration or anxiety due to the test.  General practitioner requested me to monitor resting blood pressure and heart rate several times per day.  Found that resting heart rate was never below 100 beats per minute and averaged 120 bpm and blood pressure averaged 130/90.  Began to gain weight so rapidly that stretch marks appeared on skin.  Weight went from 115 to 145 in 2 months although there were no changes in diet or exercise routine.  Nearly all of weight gained settled in the midsection creating what looked like a pregnant belly.  Intermittent chest pains continued as did the high resting heart rate.  Was sent to cardiologist and put on 24 hour holter monitor.  Cardiologist diagnosed me with inappropriate sinus tachycardia believing that the fast heart rate was originating in the sinus node of the heart while heart maintained a normal rhythm.  Was prescribed 25 mg per day of Atenolol to bring down heart rate and blood pressure.  Very negligible change in heart rate and blood pressure after 2 months on medication, dosage was increased to 50 mg per day of Atenolol.  Blood pressure fell within normal range, but resting heart rate stayed around 100.  Atenolol dosage was raised to 75 mg per day.  New symptoms developed - became intolerant to heat, or even normal temperatures, easily broke out into flop sweat, inability to lose weight, terrible headaches, night sweats, fatigue.  Cardiologist ordered thyroid tests thinking I might be hyperthyroid - was certain that there was an underlying condition causing the heart to race.  All thyroid tests came back normal.  Since then, general practitioner did more thyroid tests thinking I might be hypothyroid.  I have an older sister who is hypothyroid and on medication for it.  Have been tested 4 times for thyroid and all results came back normal.  Within past 6 months, menstrual periods became very light basically only a slight discharge lasting for 1 or 2 days.  Doctor took me off birth control pills in May, 2007 thinking it may be cause of some symptoms.  Began taking 4 qty Omega-3 capsules per day to lower cholesterol.  Have become slightly more tolerable to temperatures and night sweats have greatly diminished.  Headaches, fast heart rate, fatigue, occasional chest pains, and 145 weight have continued.  In June, 2007, had the first ever positive result for thyroid - TSH level was 6.34.  Cholesterol went from 225 to 211.  Doctor is still confused about symptoms because some symptoms seem to be more hyperthyroid and some seem to be hypothyroid.  Doctor suspected Hashimoto's thyroiditis and has ordered a blood test to see if antibodies are present.  I worry that if the antibodies are not present, we are back to square one with no diagnosis and no idea what is causing my symptoms or how to get rid of them.  Is there some other cause for my symptoms?  What should I do?  Are there other tests we should be doing?  Any insight would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi TinaLynn,  Your symptoms certainly seem consistent with an endocrinological problem.  The thyroid does seem to explain your symptoms, although, as you say, you have some symptoms of hyper and some of hypothyroidism.  If you have not, I would recommend you have your free T4 level tested as opposed to total T4.  Also, if you have not had your free T3 level tested this would also be appropriate.  If you developed your hypothyroid symptoms after starting the atenolol it may be that you were hyperthyroid and the atenolol blocked the symptoms of this.  Hashimoto's thyroiditis could potentially explain this as well.    I would also recommend you have your cortisol level tested.  This hormone is cyclic so it is best to test it in the morning when \"normal\" levels are based.  I would recommend you see an endocrinologist to help figure all this out.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Hormone imbalance?",
    "content": "Hello,  I am writing about my wife: 32 years old, female, no past diagnoses, no past surgeries, I don't know of any related family history, and no current medications.  My wife has struggled with a series of symptoms for approximately one year now - fatigue, lack of sex drive, mood swings, gaining weight around her midsection and unable to take it off, water retention, specifically in her legs, inability to deal with stress, dry hair, bad skin, depression.  I should specify that she is by no means heavy (5'2\", 120 lbs), but she is very aware of her body and has noticed that she has put on weight and is unable to take it off.  She works out approximately 5 times a week with a mixture of cardio work, weight training, and bikrham (hot) yoga.  She takes this very seriously  and trains more like an athlete than your typical woman who works out to stay thin.  She believes these symptoms can be traced back to a rather traumatic event at her job, which happened at the same time that she was training for a half marathon.  As she puts it, she's never felt the same since then.  My father-in-law is a doctor, which I mention, because it helps explains why my wife is fixated on identifying the underlying cause of her issues.  She has gone to many doctors for blood work, convinced that she has a hormonal imbalance.  Her progesterone levels consistently seem very low - around 3 during the mid-luteal phase (I think I have this correct) of her cycle.  The one endocrinologist she has seen said this wasn't an issue and wanted to put her on anti-depressants, which as you can imagine infuriated her to no end.  Her OB/GYN also was not overly concerned with her blood tests, although from what I can see her progesterone was outside of the appropriate range (too low) and her testosterone is at the very bottom of the acceptable range.  Her thyroid test have all come back normal.  During all of this, we recently found at that she was pregnant.  We are trying to get pregnant, although my top priority is getting her to a point where she can feel \"normal\" on a daily basis.  We found out that she was pregnant about 3 weeks after conception and she miscarried at approximately 4 weeks after conception.  Interestingly, she had gotten blood drawn that day and we found that her HCG level was only 300 and her progesterone level was 1.7.  The last piece of the puzzle is that she used to use progesterone cream, prescribed by her father, but since she never really knew why she was taking it, she ultimately stopped on her own.  I can't point back to that time and say she was fine while on the cream and then things went south after she stopped, but I have to admit, I am frustrated that her father didn't tell her not to go off the cream, since he is now saying that she was on it, because her progesterone has always been low.  Her father has also been talking a lot about adrenal fatigue, since she has extreme difficulty dealing with stress - things that I see as just normal life/work difficulties, will set her off into a terrible fit of crying and a sense that \"things shouldn't be this hard.\"  I have to admit that I go back and forth on daily basis between thinking this is a hormonal issue and thinking that it is completely a psychological issue (which I do understand is a medical issue in it's own right).  Ok.. long post, I know.  Here's where I'm at now.  We have an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist and what I'm wondering is if there is anything we can do to be as prepared as possible for this appointment (blood tests, saliva tests, etc.)  I am extremely frustrated with how long we have been dealing with this and I want to do anything possible to make this next doctor's appointment productive.  Any suggestions on how to present these issues so that the doctor looks at if from a general \"all the time well-being\" issue and not a fertility issue.  I feel like my wife is slowly becoming less and less functional and I am desperate for a doctor to make an attempt at a diagnosis.  Thanks you so much for taking the time to read this and I appreciate any thoughts you might have.\n\n",

    "content": "Your situation sounds difficult.  Something seems wrong and yet it isn't being found.  In these cases it is always best to be persistent and continue to follow up with her doctors.  She may want to have her cortisol levels checked.  Low cortisol levels can produce nearly all of her symptoms.    Additionally, given that her progesterone is a touch low, your reproductive endocrinologist may recommend she take progesterone supplementation during the first part of pregnancy.  I think presenting her case the way you have here is a quite effective way to get a good overall picture.  You may also want to discuss the exercise issue as excess exercise can have endocrinological consequences.  (I'm not sure your wife fits this category but it may be worth exploring.)  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 41 yr-old woman, and am currently struggling with low blood sugar issues, which the doctor's cannot explain.  All they tell me is that my white count is low.  (Ranges from 2.9 to 3.1 in the last month.)   My fasting blood sugar is around 75 on average.  When I eat, my blood sugar very quicklly spikes up past 165, and I get sweaty, hot and shaky.  Two to three hours later, it plummets down to the 50's or 60's.  I am tired all the time, lack energy, and feel terrible most of the time. They've checked my thyroid, pituitary, liver panel, and now they tell me that a fasting insulin count was 3.4 on a scale of 1.4 to 14. I am at a loss because I know there is something seriously wrong with me, but nobody seems to be able to help me.  I had both a maternal and paternal grandparent with diabetes, so it is in my family. I had a hysterectomy 7 years ago, and am on estrogen patches.  I also have a history of migraines, and take Topamax, plus Effexor.   Thank you for any help...I am very frustrated.\n\n",

    "content": "There are many reasons for intermittently low blood sugars.  These can be divided up into two main categories: low blood sugar with ketones and low blood sugar without ketone.    If ketones are not made it is a sign that either there is a problem making ketones which can lead to low blood sugar problems or that there is too much insulin around causing the low blood sugar.  If ketones are made, it is a sign that the normal signals to bring insulin down are turned off as they should be but the signals to raise blood sugar are not functioning correctly.  Your sugars appear to be borderline low but not overtly low making the usual set of possibilities a little less likely.  You may need to have a test where your blood sugars are monitored while you fast for an extended period of time.  This is usually done in the hospital so that labs can be drawn quickly if your blood sugar gets low (the best time to draw labs for hypoglycemia).    If you have not seen an endocrinologist this would be the next step.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm a 44 yr old female and over the last 6 yrs or so I've had quite a few problems.  I started out with insomnia to the point where I couldn't work full time anymore; depression; weight gain of approx 80lbs in a year; high blood pressure; extreme sweating to the point I look like I just got out of the shower; heart palpitations where I feel I'm having a heart attack.  There are many more symptoms, but those are the major ones.    I've seen a few Endocrinologists, and some results I have, others I just have been told are \"abnormal\".    UFC is usually always normal, only once had a high normal 244 nmol/L (275) Serum Cortisol after 1mg Dex 231 nmol/L ACTH was 2 pmol/L DHEAS was 2.5 mcm/L (0.9-6.5) TSH is 1.37 miu/L (0.5-5.0) Adrenal Vein Catherization Cortisol levels were:  Left Adrenal  13,564 and 19.274 nmol/L Right Adrenal  4,067 and 6,498 nmol/L. The peripheral values were 805 and 712 nmol/L. I have a 2.3cm Adenoma on my right adrenal gland, and 2 nodules on my left of 5mm and 6mm. I have been told by both Endo's I've gone to, that they're pretty sure I have Cushings Syndrome, until one test comes back ok (the UFC usually) and then I'm told there's nothing they can do for me.  Do you have any suggestions?  My life has come to a standstill with this, I really need help. I also get cramp like pains in my left and right flanks (more so the left tho).  These aren't debilitating, more of an annoyance.  I do however, get PAIN on my right side, under my ribcage (pretty much where my gallbladder used to be, but i've had an ultrasound and there's no stone in the duct or anything).   I'm sure there's so much more to tell, but I know your time is short so I won't keep you reading.   Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 29-year-old female that has been searching for a diagnosis for about 4 years now.  I weight 146 and am 5ft tall. (No other family members known to have the same problem as described below, only family dx known is hypothyroidism and thyroid cancer) A brief description of my problems:  60 pound weight gain in last 4 years (most of which was within 1 years time), headaches, extreme fatigue, panic disorder (started within the last 4 years), infertility, abnormal menstrual cycles (long cycles, short cycles, missing cycles), hirsuitism (onset at age 10-12). Recently, I started seeing an endocrinologist, for what I thought might be a thyroid problem.  The doctor sent me for numerous labs; here is a rundown of labs in the past 3 months: NORMAL RESULTS\t\t\t TSH     1.34,FreeT4  .80,Total T3  164,Antithyroglob.  <20,Thyro Recept AB  <0.3 FSH  5.7 (day 21 of cycle),Testost, Total  67,Testost, Free  1.4,Andostenedione  183 Prolactin  (norm don\u2019t have #)  ABNORMAL RESULTS LH  27.5 (day 21 of cycle),17- Hydropregnenelone  739 ng/dl,DHEA-S  2124 ng/dl CRP, Cardiac  7.31  I have had a u/s abdomen/pelvis, CT scan abdomen/pelvis, MRI brain The u/s only showed a prominent ovary The CT scan showed no adrenal masses, but did show a very small cyst on the ovary The MRI showed a pituitary micro adenoma less than 2mm ( I was told that it wasn\u2019t big enough to classify?)  I had a dexamethazone suppression test that lowered my cortisol to 0.9, ACTH plasma to <5, and DHEA SO4 to 140.  (I was told this was supposed to be the outcome)   I just had a ACTH stimulation test on Monday, and am still awaiting some results.  I do have the a.m. (baseline) cortisol 16.6ug/dl, ACTH plasma 24 pg/ml, DHEA SO4 249, with a pending Androstendione . The labs after injection are ACTH plasma 12pg/ml, DHEA SO4 250ug/dl with a pending Cortisol, and Androstendione.  The doctor seems to think that I have Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, with a slight possibility of PCOS in addition.  The ACTH test was supposed to give us an answer; I was told that if the levels were raised, then it was a dx of CAH.  My question is based on what you see here, did the levels rise enough to prove that, and if not what could the diagnoses be?  If not CAH why would my DHEA level be 2124ng/dl in a normal range of 162-995 (I was told that he had never seen a level that high before)? Thank you for any and all help/info on this matter. Sincerely, SCB\n\n",

    "content": "The endocrinology behind CAH is complicated as there are many different defects of several enzymes in the pathway that can lead to CAH.  I am most familiar with the types that present in childhood.  Your DHEA level is quite high.  Your doctorl may want ot look for an adrenal tumor as well (not necessarily cancer).  I would recommend you have your 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone level tested if it has not been.  This test is helpful in defining if CAH is present.  Your LH/FSH ratio is very suggestive of PCOS.  PCOS itself can account for many of your symptoms.  I am simply not familiar enough with these labs to be able to comment much further.  Continued follow up with your doctor is important.  You may also want to see a gynecologist regarding the PCOS issue.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Currently my endocrinologist became concerned about my lack of answers in regards to my reoccurent tachycardic episodes even though my hyperthroidism labs have been within range since the beginning of the year.  Therefore he ran the 24 hour urine sample.  Although I do not at this time have the exact figures, he mentioned that the VMA numbers were normal, but the meta and ephipherines were high.  He recently had me do the urine test again but they were inconclusive.  Also he is awaiting the results of the plasma blood test.  Are false-positives common with pheochromocytomas?  Is this something I should look into further if this next test comes back negative/inconclusive?  Would it be wise to ask for the CT Scan to look a possible tumor, even if the test is inconclusive?

    "content": "These are not the same, though some similarities.  Addison's Disease is an extreme dysfunction and potentially fatal condition where the adrenals essentially shut down.   When the adrenal glands are not functioning optimally, you can have a condition that is known as adrenal fatigue, or adrenal exhaustion which often develops after periods of intense or lengthy stress (physical or emotional) when overstimulation of the glands render them unable to meet your body's needs. So, this is more of a temporary condition.  Both of these situations can be improved with prescribed medications (hormones) and diet/lifestyle modifications, including elimination of stimulants, stabilization of blood sugar using low glycemic index foods and with vitamin supplements as instructed by physician.\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter is 20, with no past surgeries, taking only Lutera  birth control pills to keep her having periods.  Without them, they stop.  Recent visit with our famliy dr. brought up several symptoms that were indicative of Cushings, ie, weight gain, moon face, buffalo hump, irregular menstrual, moodiness, acne, fatty neck, hyperpigmentation around neck, on knuckes and underarms and stretch marks that began around age 11. This child did have spondylosis and spondolysthesis that fused with a year of being braced at age 11 also.  The doctor ordered a 24 hour free cortisol test...result was 112.  ACTH level was 87.  Referred to endocrinologist who ordered a three day dex suppresion test.  Day one, 81.5, at the end of day 3, it was 12.  Abdominal CT scan, lung base and Brain/Pituitary MRI  were unremarkable.  The endocrinologist said she has hypercortisolism but not Cushings and says there is nothing that can be done until a tumor begins to show.  Is that right?  I wonder if he has done all the tests he could to pin this down better.  Are there other possible causes we should be looking for?  Sitting and waiting for it to get worse while the high cortisol levels could cause other problems  just doesn't seem to be the right thing to do.\n\n",

    "content": "The terminology of this condition can be confusing.  Hypercortisolism is basically synonymous with \"Cushing Syndrome\".  This is not the same thing as Cushing Disease.  Cushing Disease is hypercortisolism from a pituitary adenoma.  Based on her symptoms, she may very well have Cushing syndrome.  Based on the ACTH suppression test, MRI and her other tests she does not have Cushing Disease.  Her 24 hour cortisol level is really inconclusive.  Her being on an estrogen regimen can elevate her cortisol level also making the borderline result even more inconclusive.  I would recommend her adrenal glands be evaluated if they have not yet been.  There are several medications that can be used to help inhibit cortisol production.  However, given her borderline status I understand the hesitancy of her endocrinologist to put her on such a medicine.  Too low levels of cortisol can be quite dangerous as well.  You may want to get a second opinion simply for a fresh look at her case.  Sometimes this can be quite helpful and should not be viewed as mistrust of your first doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Hypothyrodism, Severe short stature !",
    "content": "Muna is now 16-year-old female with multiple medical problems including the following: 1-\tFatty acid oxidation defect [ SCHAD ]  2-\tHypothyrodism, central. 3-\tHypocorticalism, central. 4-\tSevere short stature. 5-\tBilateral congenital dislocated hips. 6-\tScoliosis. 7-\tMyopathy.  Muna has been seen in King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center since she was an infant. She was initially referred to the metabolic service where she was diagnosed to have Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency and was started on carnitin and riboflavin and Polycose for several years for her recurrent hypoglycemia. Subsequent to that, she was treated for bilateral congenital dislocated hips by the orthopedic team using harness and then a surgery. Unfortunately, it seemed to have recurred, and she has acetabular dysplasia bilaterally. As far as her endocrine problems, I started seeing her in 2000 because of Hypothyrodism which seems to be central, i.e., low TSH ( thyroid stimulating hormone) and low free T4. She was started on thyroxine and her thyroid function was monitored thereafter every three to four months with stable thyroid function on treatment. She was screened for other hormonal deficiency and was found to have both ACTH deficiency and Growth hormone deficiency. She was treated with hydrocortisone 5 mg p.o. two times a day and still receiving this treatment. Growth hormone stimulation test was done in 2001 and was found to be low. The peak level was 12 mU/L, which is low for her age. She was started on growth hormone injection in April 2002. Her height at that time was 120.5 cm, and her weight was 39 kg. Almost a year later, she gained 6.5 cm, which is considered a good response at this point. However, a year after, in March 2004, she had only gained 2 cm on a higher dose of growth hormone. So growth hormone was discontinued after two years of treatment because of what we could say a lack of response to growth hormone. Skeletal survey was done in 2004 showed scoliosis of the mid dorsal spine, severe hypoplasia of the iliac bones and bilateral acetabular dysplasia, short fourth metacarpal bones and thinning of the bone. Subsequently, she was referred to the pediatric orthopedics, and it was decided that she needs posterior spine fusion and instrumentation. The parents preferred to take a second opinion as far as the surgery is concerned. Currently, Muna is 16 years of age, She is 129.5 cm, well below the 3rd percentile, and she crossed her centile since the age of seven years which could be typical of some form of skeletal dysplasia. She is receiving thyroxine 50 mcg once a day and hydrocortisone 5 mg twice daily, and she is off the riboflavin and carnitine. She is followed by genetic metabolic team, endocrinology, orthopedics and nutrition service.  Muna has doen the Scoliosis surgery .  The question is : in a way or another, can she get more height ?   Thank you .\n\n",

    "content": "I presume that he does not have isolated growth hormone deficiency since he is now getting testosterone injections as well.  Has he stopped getting growth hormone injections?  Generally these will be continued until the child has completed puberty and growth is complete.  Regarding the testosterone injections, if he is deficient in  testosterone he really should not have any of the side effects that people using \"extra\" testosterone get.  There are a few side effects associated with the medication itself.  These include pain at the injection site, hypertension, and elevated liver enzymes.  The typical \"side effects\" that go along with testosterone (natural or injected) are also likely including acne, voice changes, etc.  Follow up with your endocrinologist will be important to continue to monitor his progress.

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 41 year old female with no major illnesses/diagnoses to speak of, about 20 pounds overweight, and pretty sedentary at this time.  For the past month or so, I have had a hard, nonmoving, slightly tender lymph node under my ear, along with a feeling of pressure in that ear (left)--the ear pressure was first.  Originally, I thought it was from cell phone use as I noticed the ear pressure a lot more after being on the phone. My doc looked at my ear and could see no signs of infection at all.  The last few days, the pressure has expanded to be kind of my left upper quarter, including the back of my shoulder, left arm feeling kind of weird, getting tingly easily.  Also, there seems to be pressure and slight swelling/tenderness (not noticeable swelling to others) just under my left clavicle spreading across that side of my chest (are there lymph nodes there as well?)  I have not had any other signs of infection/fever at all. Do these symptoms match anything that you know of?  I have not been able to find information as to what could be going on, and i'm wondering, if my doc doens't think it's anything to worry about, should I make an appt. with an endocrinologist?   I should also mention that my mother died two years ago of adenocarcinoma of unknown primary--first noticed by swollen lymph node in her groin, it totally took over her lymph system. Thanks for any info you might have!   (the only other odd symptom i've been having is having radial nerve pain in my right arm that has been progressing for about 6 months--seems totally unrelated but thought i'd mention it)\n\n",

    "content": "Insulinoma is a pancreatic B-cell tumor and it usually causes hypoglycemia. 90% of these tumors are single and benign.   Some other symptoms include blurred vision, headache, feelings of detachment, slurred speech, and weakness. Symptoms tend to occur in the early morning or late afternoon or after fasting or exercise.  Diagnosis is made by finding an inappropriately high serum insulin level when glucose is low.  CT scan, ultrasound, and arteriography may also be useful in detecting the tumor.   Insulinoma is managed by surgery, diet, and medical therapy.  Hope this helps.  ps - Pancreas is a gland which is situated just below stomach near the duodenum. Its main role is to produce insulin which regulates (brings down) the sugar levels in blood. So roughly, Insulinoma could be considered as opposite to Diabetes type I, where there is less insulin production due to destruction of beta cells.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 29 y.o. female.  3 c-sections and recently (3 weeks ago) had my gallbladder removed.  Prior to having my gallbladder removed I was having severe panic attacks at least once a day.  During these panic attacks my blood pressure would skyrocket but any other time it was fine.   I was put on 1mg of Ativan under the tongue to take during my attacks.  During this time I had my cortisol tested (saliva). My 8 a.m. results were .18 with the normal range being .27-2.06 and my 12 a.m. results were <.03 with the normal range being .03-.50.  DHEA was 232 with the normal range being 14-277.  I have had symptoms of Cushing's for years and my doctor even said that I had the appearance of a person with Cushing's.  I understand that a person with Cushing's has a high cortisol level though.  He did a CAT scan of my adrenal gland which came back fine. Since my surgery I am having terrible troubles with my blood pressure.  It is consistently high with the bottom number in the triple digits and it seems to get higher as I  move around. I can literally feel pressure in my head and tightness in my chest when it starts getting real high.  The doctor started me on Toprol and Amlodipine but it doesn't seem to be touching the blood pressure which makes me think that the blood pressure is being cause by something else.  I am still taking the Ativan because I was scared of going through withdrawls with my blood pressure being so high.  But when I take the Ativan it does seem to help lower my blood pressure.  I have also had a persistant sinus infection since at least Jan.\n\n",

    "content": "One possibility is that you have a cortisol-like substance running around in your body causing the symptoms of high cortisol but in the meantime suppressing your body's normal cortisol.  This would be quite rare but does happen.  There are several drugs that can do this as well.  You may want to consider seeing an endocrinologist.  Also, if you have not had a cortisol stimulation test (where you are given a medication that should raise your cortisol level then your levels are checked for proper response) you should probably have one done.  Follow up with your doctor is important, especially regarding your blood pressure.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Am not on any medication, recently inlight of these problems the gp put me on antianxiety meds as thought that anxiety might have been the cause but they did nothing for me at all and symptoms and weight were still unresolved, so not on anything now.  Physically, my temp is uaually lowish (hands are always really cold), pulse fast at usually 100-200bpm resting, bp usually normal 112/77   I have been told these are many of the signs of adrenal insufficiency, cant gain weight, weakness, tiredness, lack of energy/ stamina, severe hypoglycemia esp when havent eaten in a while..could go on, (its been suggested that it could be a hormonal problem, adrenal? thyroid? etc )   However my question is recently i am much more thirsty, i have frequent urination of large volume that is usualy unconsentrated, and i have missed my last period, which is very unusual as i am usually very regular (i am not sexually active or taking the pill), i wondered if these could also be linked to adrenal, thyroid, hormonal problems? thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Your symptoms do sound like something is going on.  Absent menses or delayed menses are often in response to stress (physical or psychological).  Your issues with hypoglycemia and the frequent urination that is unconcentrated could indicate there is a problem with the pituitary gland.    The pituitary gland secretes a hormone called Antidiuretic hormone (ADH).  It's action is to cause the kidney to concentrate urine by reabsorbing water.  The pituitary also signals for and releases other hormones, such as cortisol and growth hormone, as well as thyroid stimulating hormone.  Lacking these hormones can lead to low blood sugar, low body temperatures, and many other effects.  I would recommend you see your primary care doctor for an evaluation.  Many of these hormones can be tested quite easily with a simple blood test and urine test.  A few of them need slightly more complicated challenge testing.  Keep us updated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Using medications (particularly these types of medicines) can be very dangerous when using them for reasons other than for their approved uses.    Weight loss is best done using a balanced, healthy diet with exercise.  The key is moderation.  I'm sure you've heard this before and I don't want to sound like I'm underestimating how difficult weight loss can be.  But a moderate exercise program with healthy eating really is the safest way to loose weight.  When you mention that you had binge eating, if you are continuing to binge eat this will definitely lead to weight gain.  You may want to consider seeing an eating disorder specialist to help get your eating difficulties unde control if this is still a problem for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Interesting.  I've never seen this before to this extent; however, if you are not having any symptoms of hyperthyroidism (as I suspect that you are not since your free T4 level is normal) it is likely that you would not need to take any medications and your TSH can be rechecked periodically.  TSH is generally quite sensitive to the T4 and T3 needs of the body.  If the body is sensing too much or too little the TSH can change dramatically in response.  I would recommend that, even though your T4 is normal) you have a full thyroid hormone profile done including T3 levels to see if your T3 level is elevated.  If this were true it could cause your TSH to drop (although, again, if your T3 was elevated I would expect symptoms of hyperthyroidism).  It is probably a good idea for you to be followed by an endocrinologist since this is a little outside the realm of a \"typical\" thyroid patient.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I am a 28 year old male. I currently have been having a strange problem. I took a flight about 3 months ago to see my girlfriend. The flight takes 21 hours total. When I arrived I noticed my lymph nodes at my groing were quite swollen, but did not hurt. They began to get better after a couple days. When I arrived back home they were swollen again so I went to my doctor. He took blood, but found nothing unusual. I just recently flew again to see her about a week ago. Again when I arrived my lymph nodes were swollen at my groin. Again after a couple days they got better, and were swollen again when I got home. It has been a few days and are better now. Why is this happening? Can flying in a plane affect the lymph nodes somehow? I am really concerned that I have an underlying condition. Any ideas? Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Interesting.  Fairly clearly your symptoms revolve around the plane flights.  I've not heard of this before; however, it may be that the long plane flight is causing some congestion of your blood vessels that may be leading to the swollen lymph nodes.  When veins become backed up (congested) some fluid leaks out of them and is picked up by the lymphatic vessels that flow through the lymph nodes.    Perhaps the plane seats are causing some increased congestion.  You may want to try getting up and walking around frequently during your flights to see if this will help.    I don't think this is anything serious but I'm betting it's fairly annoying.  Sorry I can't come up with much of a better explanation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Possible pheochromocytoma",
    "content": "Hello, I will do my best to explain and please forgive my lack of medical terminology.   Age: 36 Sex: Male Past diagnoses: Hypertension, adrenergic Spells, adrenal hyperplasia, and anxiety. Past surgeries:  Right hernia and right and left eyes to correct \u201calternating lazy eyes\u201d.  Family history: Hypertension, diabetes, goiter (my mother).  Current Medications Vasotec 2.5 mg twice daily, Tenormin 25mg once daily, and Klonopin 1 mg 4 times daily.  I was very healthy until at the age of 18 years old (1989). I got mononucleosis. Shortly after this, I got pneumonia, as a secondary infection to strep throat, which was undiagnosed until the pneumonia was diagnosed. I had a very severe reaction to Entex. My symptoms were; extreme nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, and a fear I was going to die. I discontinued the medication and most symptoms went away. This seems to be the start of subtle symptoms that continued to manifest over the years. I started having small episodes of nervousness and anxiety over the next year. My family physician dismissed these initially as just being the results of me going to college and wrestling. He just thought it was normal stress.   My symptoms grew worse over the next few years. I had increased anxiety, nervousness, tremors, sweating, a flushed feeling, chest pains, nausea headaches, and some insomnia. My family physician had me take a couple of 24 hour urine VMA tests. I had elevated levels. He sent me to an endocrinologist (1992). I learned I was not to dump the acid out of the jugs. The endocrinologist repeated the 24 hour urine VMA and included the testing of metanephrines. The results were elevated with the urine metanephrines being 1.29, normal (0-.29). I am not exactly sure were this range is from, as I can\u2019t find it now on the web as being a reference. My T4 was 9.7. The endocrinologist ordered a CT scan with results being normal (1992). The endocrinologist advised to try Doxepin or Prozac. I tried both, as well as several other antidepressants. I had no success; they actually increased my nervousness and insomnia. The endocrinologist expected a patient with a pheo to be more adrenergic, losing weight, with hypertension, and headaches.   With the lack of results, my family physician sent me to another endocrinologist (1992). I was tested for a carcinoid, the 5HIAA returned normal. The thyroid function was check and a prolactin which was 4. Thyroid functions were normal. TSH was 1.4; T4 was 7, T3 resin uptake was 28%, and thyroid antibodies were negative.  Without any endocrinologists being very close to where I live, my family physician just treated the symptoms, hoping to find the cause or another endocrinologist. Tragically in 1993, my family physician was killed in an automobile accident. I bounced around to some different doctors.   In 1994, I saw another endocrinologist. He just performed a blood draw in his office for some type of test to see if the adrenal gland was overactive. It turned out to be negative. At this time, I had flushing, anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, night sweats, hypertension (controlled after several trial and errors with different medication), headaches, developed some acne, and fatigue. It was recommended that I go to The Mayo Clinic for my complicated problems.  I have somewhat, learned to live with these problems, as I became frustrated with the medical system. I was tired of going to endocrinologists with no results. I have done this until now. I take the same medicines I did in 1994. I now have nervousness, hypertension, anxiety, tremors, chest pain, sweats, inappropriate sweating (under arms), insomnia, flushing, heat intolerance, I feel terrible after exercise, my weight has gone down (even with attempts to increase it), frequent urination, and fatigue. My current family physician was referred me to an endocrinologist, unfortunately it it the same one I saw the first time.  I do not really want to go down this course again, but I want to feel better. My symptoms have increased, I have more, and I want to have a healthy life. I have been police officer for over 14 years, so normal stress is nothing new to me. I am just looking for advise about what I could possibly have going on. Thank you in advance for any and all help. It is greatly appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "I had that same problem and it was my thyroid.  I'm just a regular person but have had 20 years of thyroid experience.  Went to over 16 doctors in 6 years and they all told be basically I was crazy.  Same exact symptomsas you.  I finally had to call a doctor and demand he would give me ALL three different thyroid tests or I would not see him. First one, thyroid scan, came back cold nodule (possible cancer) but he said no way...it is not so don't worry.  Then he did the second test, thyroid ultrasound, and it came back with Hashimoto's disease (immune stuff) with a cobblestone pattern on my thyroid but he said \"I did not have cancer.\"  Finally, I wanted a needle biopsy on the nodule.  He said it was a waste of time and didn't want to do it and I reminded him he promised.  He said he was going to India for 6 weeks and he would do it then.  When he got back, I had to call him to remind and schedule.   Two days later he calls up and says I have thyroid cancer.  (Duh!)  That was three years ago and I had complete thyroidectomy, so watching my thyroid levels are key. You have to see where on the spectrum your TSH levels are.  The doctor should have definitely felt your thyroid for nodules.  Sometimes one person's TSH normal levels are not another.  I would recommend asking your doctor to give you a very small dose of thyroid supplementation for about 6 weeks to see if the symptoms reduce.  If so, then that could be your problem.  I would also recommend a thyroid scan to check for any hot or cold nodules that could be problems.  I'm assuming you had a complete CBC and everything else came out normal.  Don't give up...I felt like I was dying and going crazy at the same time...it took 6 years, 16 specialists, thousands and thousands of dollars but I read everything I could and basically diagnosed myself.  I know how horrible you feel and I wish you all the best.   I'm sending you good thoughts!  : D\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 31 year old female andI have a cyst on my thyroid which has a solid component too. As far as I am aware, my blood test results were normal.  I have had a fna and have been told that the lump is not cancerous but I know no more about it other than that I am due to have it removed in 3 weeks time. I am so confused as to whether I actually need the surgery. The consultant that I saw before the FNA said that he usually removes lumps as they have a risk of turning nasty in the future - does this apply to a cyst with a solid component?  One registrar advised me that if I left the lump there it would be fine but that I would have it checked every 6 months (why check it if it would be fine?) and the other said that it was best to have it removed to double check that it was not cancerous. I just don't know what to do for the best. . I really need advice as to whether it is of a benefit to me to have this surgery. Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Typically hypothyroidism would make a person gain weight since it slows down the metabolism of the body.  It can be associated with changes in the menstrual cycle, though.  By my calculations your BMI is 16.  This is on the thin side but not severely so.  Sometimes the menstrual cycle will stop if a woman is too thin.  This is seen commonly in anorexics as well as in female athletes that don't have much body fat.  Presumably the thought is that if the body doesn't have enough fat stores it may not be able to support pregnancy so the menstrual cycles stop (this is probably a bit of a simplified explanation but teleologically makes sense).  You may want to see a reproductive endocrinologist to have a work up done on why you are not cycling.  These doctors are specialists in fertility.  Also, if you are hypothyroid I would recommend that this be treated.  The body runs better over all if the thyroid levels are normal.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I have read through all your posts and I would be quite suspicious of a deficiency in cortisol.  You may have an isolated cortisol deficiency or other hormones of the adrenal gland may also be affected.  I would recommend that you talk to your doctor about having your cortisol level tested and possibly have a cortisol stimulation test to see if your cortisol level increases as it should.  Cortisol counteracts insulin and a deficiency may lead to hypoglycemia.  Cortisol is also an important factor in being able to maintain blood pressure.  If you are having low blood pressure this, along with your low blood glucose levels, may be contributing to your fainting.  You may also want to have your aldosterone level tested to be sure there isn't a deficiency with this hormone as well.  It is involved in fluid regulation that also relates to your blood pressure.  Best wishes.  Also, please note that I have removed most of your other posts and consolidated them into this post.  If you still have questions please feel free to post a follow up.\n\n",

I'm 24 health yo male, I'm from europe.  for the past 2 years I have lost my libido  when I'm saying \"lost\" I mean it.  I don't have any libido, I don't think on sex at all.  I don't have morning erections.  even when I try to masturbate (without being horny)  I can't keep my erection even for 1 min without touching my penis.  I found out its bcz I don't have any libido  I don't find myself thinking about sexy situations at all.  when I see a beautiful guy on the street (I'm gay)  I don't feel anything, not even start of erection   I visit the clinic, I visit eourologic doctor, he checked my penis and testicles, and said everything is ok.  I had a lot of blood tests.  I found that my testosterone is very high, so no one can explain.  I also visit a shrink, he talked to me, and say I'm very healthy psycologically. he found nothing about me.  I'm not deppresed at all, he confirm this.   here are my blood results :   LH - 2. 1 IU/L (normal : 1. 6 - 7. 8)  FSH - 2. 0 IU/L (normal : 0. 7 - 11. 1)  TSH - 1. 9 mIU/L (normal : 0. 35 - 5. 5)  Prolactin - 319 mIU/L (normal : 45-375)  Testosterone Total - 31. 4 nmol/L (normal : 8. 4 - 28. 8)  Estradiol E2 - 254 pmol/L (normal : 0-206)  Dhea-S - 6. 5 mcmol/L (normal : 7. 5 - 17. 3)  Cortisol Blood - 533 nmol/L (normal : 138-690)  SHBG - 35. 5 nmol/L (normal : 13-71)  Free Androgen Index - 88. 6% (normal : 28-80)  IRON - 220 mcg/dL (normal : 39-158)    I also wanted to say that my testosterone level was 44. 6 - 7 month ago, and now its a little lower, but still very high.  I was supprised about the Estradiol level, its the first time I checked it, and I don't know why its so high, I don't have any famimine things on my body, I'm very thing, I don't have any breasts or nipples like woman, my voice is very low.  also, I think prolactin is a bit high, and cortisol as well.  my dhea-s is low. and my LH is low as well, 7 month ago it was 3. 4 and now it drops to 2. 1  my iron is very high, I don't know the reason for that, I don't eat alot of meat of something, I don't take iron pills.  my iron was : \"60\" - 1. 5 year ago.   I hope you can help me figure out what can I do?  bcz I'm very misrable with my life right now.  I feel like I'm no longer a man, bcz a man usually have a strong libido, and I have none.   I used to have a great libido, I wanted sex all the day.  2 years ago, its diseapeared without any reason.   please tell me what can I take? what is the problem that u r seeing in my case?  what could be wrong? where to start from ?

    "content": "Unfortunately, I don't think I will be of much help to you.  Looking at your lab tests it appears you've had a thorough work up and have looked for the most common things that cause loss of libido.  The biggest factors often are stress and depression.  It seems that you have looked into the depression issue and that isn't it.  Stress can certainly have a large impact on libido (good and bad stress).  The elevated estrogen level is likely due to the elevated testosterone level.  Testosterone is aromatized into estrogen by fat cells.  I do have a few thoughts for you.  1) with the elevated iron levels you may want to be evaluated for hemochromatosis.  It's fairly rare but hemochromatosis is associated with elevated iron levels and loss of libido.  2) Zinc deficiency can lead to elevated levels of estrogen in a man.  You may want to have your zinc levels tested or take a multivitamin with the full daily allowance of zinc in it.  Also, if you are taking any medications you should check their side effects to see if this may be a result of medicines.  Best wishes.\n\n",

After I pulled the muscles, I contacted my Dr. who prescribed Soma, which I have taken on numerous occasions.  The glands/lymph nodes are not sore anymore but are still there.  They both feel like small bird eggs and can move around.  The one on the left side is quite a bit larger than the other.

    "content": "Hi, I am a 21 year old female and I have written quite a few questions recently about some problems that I have been having. I was recently diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and had a throid ultrasound that confirmed there are no growths or tumors but, my doctor is sending me to the endo and I don't get in for another month. Also, I was having some stomache, pelvic, and back pain so, my doctor did a cat scan that confirmed I also had a few cysts on my ovaries and fluid around my colon but, the biggest cyst is only two cm. I was supposed to start my period four days ago and I always start on the same day and have really heavy periods but, my period never came. I have been cramping on and off like I do with my period and occasionaly I will see a spot of pink blood on the toilet paper when I wipe but, nothing else. My husband had a vicectomy about a year and a half ago but, I took a pregnancy test just to be sure and it is negative. Can my hyperthyroidism be causeing this...or my cysts maybe???                                           Thanks,                                                      luvumason\n\n",

I have had a 24 our cortisol done twice both times came back low normal with one being 5 and the other 7,  normal range was listed as between 5 and 20.  I can not recall the units of measurment.  Currently,  I am exhausted, dizzy, weak and for the last few weeks have weird stabbing headaches.   My Endo says maybe late onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia but my 17- oh  came back normal twice.  I have had elevated DHEAS and Testosterone in the past but this time came back normal.  I am obese and my endo was concerned about cushings, but these labs do not look like that .  Any opinions on what is wrong with me?  Currently,  I am yet again home from work sick, fever and headache and I really need to figure out what is wroing with me and how to get well.  thanks for any help mjak\n\n",

Often, when interpreting a cortisol level the stress level will be taken into account such that even if the level is normal but not high there may still be suspicion of a problem.  To better test cortisol levels, a stimulation test can be done to see if the cortisol level appropriately raises.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 50-something athletic, fit female who had been taking 100mcg of Synthroid for many years without problems until several months ago when I began to experience chest pain, SOB, palpitations and sudden alopecia. Subsequent labs showed no changes in my TSH/T3 levels. My PCP changed me over to Levoxyl , then to generic thyroid (Levothyroxine) which caused the same side effects.   Consequently I've been taking Armour thyroid 90mg daily for 6 weeks.  Last week's thyroid labs: TSH 0.20          Free T4 0.82   It's a relief to be free of the side effects from the synthetic thyroid but I'm experiencing a tremendous amount of fatigue, muscle aches, and I cannot seem to nap enough! If I were to titrate the Armour dose to symptoms, I would increase it by 30 mgm. However I'm concerned about bottoming out the TSH.   What might a doctor suggest regarding either Armour doses or other treatment modalities?  I beg you to not say, \"Ask your MD.\"      Thank you in advance for your valuable time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hmmm...  Based on your symptoms and low end Free T4 level I would suspect that you are hypothyroid.  It is interesting that your TSH is low, indicating too much thyroid hormone but this really does not match your symptoms.  You may benefit from having the remainder of your thyroid labs tested (T3 level, thyroid binding globulin level, etc.).  If these are in agreement with a hypothyroid state I would think you need more thyroid hormone.  I am really not able to explain your low TSH level unless, perhaps, you have central hypothyroidism (I.e. the pituitary gland is not making enough TSH to signal the thyroid to make thyroid hormone.  I would recommend that you follow up with an endocrinologist to get some specialist advice.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Synthroid is synthetic T4.  If you are hypothyroid, your body will produce less than normal amounts of T3 which is then converted to T4.  By taking supplemental T4, you can maintain a normal thyroid state but the body continues to underproduce T3.  So, your labs are exactly as I would expect, T4 levels that are relatively normal and T3 levels that continue to go lower.  T4 is generally thought to be the active form of thyroid hormone.  Generally there is no need to replace T3 and T3 levels are rarely checked.  I would recommend you see an endocrinologist to better determine which medications you should be on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "The ultrasound would be helpful in finding any nodules that may be over-producing thyroid hormone.  This is really a less common cause in someone your age.  More likely is a condition known as Grave's disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis.  In these conditions, the body makes antibodies that attack the thyroid gland.  In Grave's disease, the antibodies bind to the receptor to induce the thyroid to make more thyroid hormone.  In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the antibodies actually damage the thyroid hormone cuasing extra thyroid hormone to leak out into the blood.  Initially, the thyroid levels are high until the thyroid gland is damaged to the point that it quits making thyroid hormone and then the thyroid hormone levels fall.  The hormone levels may return to normal but typically will ultimately become low.  The endocrinologist will likely order tests to detect these antibodies to help determine if any of these diseases are occurring.  Both are treatable, as are most of the other possible causes.

    "title": "Inexplicable Inability to Lose Weight",
    "content": "I have a problem that no doctors I have visited seem to have an answer for. For full understanding of the problem, I must give a small history first. I have been overweight most of my life. By the time I finished high school, I was about 300 pounds. When I went to college, I decided to try working out a little and began swimming in the mornings, causing me to lose weight and I was easily keeping at 270 pounds without changing my eating habits. After two years of this, I decided to go all out and lose a bunch of weight if I could. I began severly cutting my food intake and was working out 10+ hours per week and drinking protein shakes to suppliment my weight lifting. I got down to 255 pounds and my body fat percentage was 21. I was happy with where I ended up, so I wanted to stay at that level. It was at the end of this intense workout time that I also tried taking a thyroid suppliment because I read that the tyroid controls the metabolism and I wanted to try and kick start my metabolism even more. After taking that suppliment (sorry, I don't remember the name, it was like thyrodyne or thyroxine or something similar) my thyroid swelled up. I took it a total of 5 days and thought it might be related and stopped taking it. A few months later, I tried taking it again for 4 days with the same swelling result and then I discarded the rest of the medication. Just a few months after this, I began gaining weight uncontrollably. In about 1 year and 6 months, while still working out 6 hours a week (though not on the intense diet as before, I was eating no more than 2200 calories/day) I gained 145 pounds. My weight gain was so quick and staggering that I actually had to curb my working out because my weight gain was making it difficult to continue working out as I was. I went to a doctor the first time and he tested my thyroid and found me to be somewhat hypothyroid. I took some thyroid hormone and it had no effect. I continued the treatment and when I ran out of my prescription, I was off it for a time and was checked again and my hormone levels were then normal. That was over 5 years ago and, several workout regimens later, I still have not been able to shed a single pound. I have even used workout buddies and I have been faithful with my working out, but still, not a pound leaves my body. I worked out with a friend once and, while doing the exact same exercises for the same amount of time for two months and while eating a less than 2000 calorie diet, I watched him lose 10 pounds and I stayed the exact same. It baffled even him. I have lost a job because of my weight and now have daily back pain due to my weight. I have begun swimming 3 times/week trying to lose weight again, but still the same problem. Have any ideas? Here is some additional medical information. Weight: 400 pounds Age: 29 Sex: Male Height: 6'1\" Frame: Large B/P: 120/80 Cholesterol: 160 Maximum daily caloric intake: 2800 (average 2500) Workout: lap swim (1/2 mile) 3-4 times/week (takes about 1/2 hour-45 min) Medication: None Family History: Only my brother struggles with weight, but he is still 80 pounds lighter than me. I am by far the heaviest in my family Glucose: I am not diabetic but my last glucose tolerance test showed that I was in the early stages of insulin intolerance, but my blood sugar is normal Thyroid: All my thyroid hormones are normal and my thyroid has not swelled since that episode 5 years ago. It went down after about 2-3 days.  What's wrong with me? Doctors keep just referring me to a nutritionist and say I'm lying because there's no way I'm only eating a 2000 calorie diet and exercising and not losing weight. I don't like being called a liar, especially when I've been trying so desperately to lose weight.\n\n",

    "content": "Oddly enough, you say your B/P is normal. That intrigues me. Anyway, since you say your thyroid tests are normal, maybe you are taking the wrong approach to weight loss. Consuming to low amount of calories will cause your metabolism to slow down, making weight loss difficult. I feel you should increase your caloric intake to help keep your metabolism working properly. For a person of your height ans size, I woudl recommend consuming an average of 3100 calories per day. Increase slowly, adding a few hundred calories every week until you are at 3100. Also eat several small, healthy meals per day, instead of 3 large meals. Make sure they are balanced, healthy meals such as lean meats and plenty of fruits and veggies. Cut out all unhealthy beverages, such as soda. Try not to eat any refined sugars or prepackaged meals. The more fresh the food is, the healthier it is for you.  Combine this new eating plan with some exercize, and you should see weight drop.  A safe weight loss is 1-2  lbs per week, and if you consume 3100 calories per day, and combine with a good exercize program, you should be able to lose 1.5 lbs per week.  You may have damaged your metabolism when you decided to go all out and lose dramatic weight loss, and took thyriod suppliments, so you need to get your metabolism back into a healthy, working order.  I would also suggest speaking to your doctor, and getting a full panel of tests to see if there are any other causes for your weight gain. A nutritionist may also be better able to help you work out a meal plan and healthy eating habits to help you lose some weight.   Good luck\n\n",

I read in a post elsewhere on the internet that having insulin intolerance will also make it difficult to lose weight. I have not seen much confirmation of this, but I wonder if you know if this is true? Since I do have insulin intolerance, perhaps if there is some medication out there to increase my body's ability to use insulin it will allow me to lose weight easier by metabolizing sugar more effectively.  Is there such a medication and is this a possibility?  Thank you for your time!\n\n",

My acne has not really improved, despite being on the pill, and most of my weight gain is in the abdomen. I also have big pinkish stretch marks on my stomach- I wonder if this is normal- I figure my skin should have more elasticity and stretch.

Thank you very much![/quote]  Dear cta,  I had questionable but \"within normal range\" thyroid test results for years, from my late teens into my twenties. They testing was a result of lethargy, fatigue, etc. Luckily, I had a concerned and thorough OB/GYN who insisted I get a second opinion after my primary did nothing. I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and had a complete thyroidectomy nine and a half years ago. At the time, acquaintences told me that I would never be able to have children. Obviously, I take thyroid replacement daily, and will for the rest of my life. I am and always have been on a monster dose (ranging from 250 mcgs to 400 mcgs a day). I am now thirty four and have a five and a half year old son and an eighteen month old daughter. I would think that it would be more detrimental to you not to take the medicine than to take it- you need to get that TSH as close to zero as possible. Being on replacement does not mean you will not be able to have children- I am living proof! Discuss this with your primary, your endocrinologist, and your OB/GYN, and make an informed decision that you can live with. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Gigantism attributed hormones",
    "content": "This was asked on a test recently, and I had a dispute with the answer the professor chose, and searched alot of medical journals and the closest information that I found was that it could not be determined one way or another, supporting my origional answer. I asked her to support her evidence and she refused to. Nothing in the required text for class or the lecture supported her answer. Before bringing this to the head of the department, I wanted the opinion of someone who knew more than I did on the topic. This was the question: A 10 y/o girl is 6 feet tall. Her father is 5'8, and her mother is 5'0. What could be attributed to the girls height at her age? A. High human growth hormone B. High estrogen C. Low insulin D. Low thyroid E. A and B.  Some thoughts to concider, 1. We did not discus normal vs high levels of estrogen and its effects on bone growth or alterations in growth velocity, but sex hormones were discussed and said to attribute to a puberty growth spurt (but the growth spurt length was not discussed). 2. We did not discuss what is concidered normal age to enter puberty. 3. We did discuss that in an enviroment where there is no estrogen, bones continue to grow, and that estrogen treatment is required to cause the epiphyseal plates to stop growing. 4. Estrogen insensitivity was discussed and was suggested to have normal puberty increases in velocity, but increased expected height. 5. Early estrogen was said to cause sooner proliferation exaution of chondrocytes in epiphyseal plates, and to decrease expected height, but to increase height relative to age. 6. Growth hormone without estrogen or androgens was not discussed, or its effects on growth without androgens or estrogen. 7. Estrogen and androgen was only said to increase growth hormone output. 8. It was discussed that growth was linear untill puberty, which would cause a short burst in height then it would be stopped by the introduction of sex hormones.  My answer was A, high human growth hormone. I answered this because only high growth hormone could cause the girl to be that tall concidering her parents (assuming that the parents did not have celiacs or lactose intolerance or nutritional deficencies during growth) which would be the only thing that would attribute the height. While normal amounts of estrogen and other hormones MAY add to the effects in this case, this is unknown in gigantism (if high or normal or low or no estrogen can or ever would effect growth velocity in someone with growth hormone levels high enough to cause gigantism), and it is possible HIGH estrogen would cause early epiphyseal closure, and likely if estrogen was increased proportionally with growth hormone that she would just reach her expected height (dad -13cm +mom)/2 + or -2 sooner. High levels of growth hormone have been shown to cause early puberty in people during high growth hormone treatment, so the estrogen SHOULD be normal for and adult or for puberty in the girl, and thus high would not be a factor, rather the growth hormone would take over and drive this train wreck. Additionaly, studies have showed that injections of high levels of growth hormone likely DO NOT add benifit in predicting height UNLESS they are given BEFORE puberty. The effects of high estrogen with or without growth hormone was not discussed in class, so that question shouldnt have even been asked in that manner, but rather in an essay.   Her answer was E. I layed out everything I said on this post to her during lecture, which she agreed with everything I said. All she said is that estrogen protects chondrocytes and high levels sould cause a growth spurt, adding additional height to her.    Remember, high levels of estrogen and its role was never discussed in class, and estrogen was only said to have a protective effect in chondrocytes that were not associated with height, but with appositional growth. The only thing estrogen was shown to do normally was cause increased rate of cellular turn over and increasing the rate at wich bone high was stopped.  The only thing that i can find even close to estrogen in chondrocytes was a study in rats with a estrogen producing mutation directly in the bones, limiting the exposure to normal androgens (now, there will be a greater level of estrogen to androgens in the model, and I have heard that rats do not stop growth at puberty like humans, but rabbits do, and the study with rabits showed that high estrogen given by pellets, not oral estrogen,  WITH high growth hormone killed velocity of growth in length and sealed the bones in a few days)  Anyones thoughts would be appreciated\n\n",

    "content": "I would tend to agree with your answer for a few reasons.  You are correct that increased growth hormone (GH) would stimulate growth in height.  GH stimulates a release in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) that induceds bone and msucle growth.  Elevated levels of estrogen will induce early pubertal changes and thus induce the growth spurt earlier; however, it also induces bone maturation (i.e. closure of the growth plates of the bones).  So, girls with elevated estrogen and subsequently early puberty do get their growth spurt early and tend to be the taller girls in their class initially but subsequently stop growing while the other girls continue to grow.  Thus, the early estrogen girls end up shorter than expected.  The reason for this is that puberty induces a growth spurt that is essentially for a fixed amount of time.  Once this time is up, the growth plates have fused and growth basically stops.  The more time a girl has to grow before the growth spurt the taller she will be in the end.  So your professor is correct that elevated estrogen does induce growth; however, for the estrogen to induce enough growth to cause a 10 year old to be 6 ft. tall would be extremely rare.  I'm not aware of any such cases.  As an aside, girls who go through early puberty usually end up being less than 5' 4\" (approx.) tall also arguing against a resulting 6' tall girl.  (5'4\" is considered the average height for an adult woman.)  Interesting question.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your review of this and response Dr. Chan Lowe, I really appreciate this.  Only one thing that I am not certain of is if the combination of high levels of human growth hormone (enough to cause a 10 y/o to be 6') would have and added effects from high levels of estrogen vs normal levels.   One thought is that puberty is related to high levels of sex hormones AND growth hormone.  Low levels of IGF would cause short stature during puberty (pygme {sp?} of africa for example)  That in mind, the only thing that I ever found on administration of high levels of HGH that caused any additional height was prior to puberty, and the general consensus was that administration of high levels of HGH during that time would cause no additional benifit.   So, would abnormally high levels of growth hormone get ANY benifit from EXTRA estrogen above that seen in puberty?   A study done in rabbits recently showed that high estrogen with high growth hormone only caused a decceleration of growth velocity and epiphyseal closure vs high growth hormone.  My instinct is that the estrogen would not add a benifit in high levels vs normal in a case where high hgh was already there and also that estrogen normally induces high growth velocity because of its ability to increase hgh and igf levels, but if they were already high any increase of estrogen above normal levels wouldnt make a significant difference.  Anyone agree or disagree?\n\n",

The article also shows the puberty growth spurt with high levels of hormones is more properly defined as a growth in width and weight.  So, according to the review, yes, growth hormone levels would make her tall, and high estrogen would silence the effects of the growth hormone, and only decrease the rate of change in verticle growth, and not increase it.   So the answer should be A. High Growth Hormone\n\n",

    "content": "I have a series of health problems all starting from throwing out my back, I threw my back out in aug of 06 and since then my back hasn\u2019t really healed. After throwing out my back it felt like something ripped in my lower left back hip area and since then my body hasn\u2019t really healed it has just been slowly breaking down . After I felt something tear in my back it seemed to effect my arms and legs, now everything is getting weak quick I have lost 10 pounds and am losing strength in all y body I can barley drive because of my arms and cant open things, my body gives off a smell of chlorine in my urine, sweat and bile. I have been to every doctor but endocrinologist, and urologist. Is it possible that my hormones may be out of wack for some reason that would cause me to feel like I am becoming crippled, I am 25 year old male, was in good shape until I threw out my back, I should mention I was in Iraq for 4 months and did construction before I threw out my back what would cause all my muscles to break down so fast and lose strength so quickly and what it this weird chlorine smell?  i also must add i have been seen at the va hospital in baltimore and i don't really trust them\n\n",

Electrolyte abnormalities such as low potassium can also cause weakness.  I would recommend that you see or follow up with a neurologist.  Muscular weakness is very commonly associated with nerve problems.  I can't think of much else beyond this.  Sorry I'm not of more help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have a problem and many symptoms that brings to thyroid disorders - hypothyroidism... I v been on diet and diet for few years... and i v been on the border of serious anorexia. So I solve this problem myself. Im 166cm and have 48kg (almost anorexia)... So, this was about 2 years ago. Im 62kg at the moment. so... got weight gain. I had ortorexia too! I have all these symptoms: fatigue, lack of energy, mood swings, fluid retention, weight gain, cold intolerance, very cold feet, decreased memory - concentration, depression, low motivation-ambition, very brittle nails and slow growth, thiny hair, very slow healing, very low sex drive - libido, erectile dysfuntciton, muscle weakness, and the last thing, most important - vision problems. I think that vision disturbance is getting worse from year to year! So... I have been to my doctor, and he take TSH tests. In a few days, he says that im fine with TSH. (2.3). But I knew there is something wrong with me, and that I did not fell the way i felt about 5 years ago. So i decided to go to another doctor, but not my primary, couse he wanted to give me some antidepresant. Im from Slovenia actually, and I decided to go to Ljubljana to hospital poly-clinic to take a whole Thyroid tests... and... here's my thyroid results:  TSH: 0.043 mE/L (0.35-5.5) FT4: 5.6 pmol/L (11.5-22.7) FT3: 2.74 pmol/L (3.5-6.5) antiTg: 13.4 KE/L (do 60) antiTPO: 39.4 KE/L (do 60)  There is written down on a paper that I have Secondary Hypothyroidism, and I ll be called to a hospital for hospitalization, to check and test for primary cause because my thyroid insuficiency. I heard from one of the doctors that may by Pituitary gland problem. I have just read on the internet about Pituarity gland, hypopituitarism and about tumors. Im going to hospitalization in about 14 days. And till the date  i was wondering what is really happening to me? How posibility is there that i have a pituitary tumor.

    "content": "Generally, the TSH is the most sensitive marker for hyper or hypothyroidism.  Your TSH is low normal.  It is interesting that your free T4 and free T3 are both low.    Given your symptoms it is very possible that your pituitary is having trouble making TSH.  Thus, your pituitary may actually be ramping up its production of TSH just to make it low normal.  In your case, it may be worthwhile to try taking some thyroid hormone supplementation to see if your symptoms improve.  Regarding workup for a pituitary problem, often an MRI of the brain is needed to look for microsized tumors that may be causing the problems.  They'll also want to test the other hormones made by the pituitary to see if they are affected.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dr. Chan Lowe. Thanks for your answer. Can you answer me just to a few questions?  I forgot to tell that I was using T3 tablets (for bodybuilding) about 6 months ago. I took 7.5mg a bid/day, one in the morning and one in the evening (12h apart) - I have read Wilson's Temp Syndrome Book, and act according to instructions for WTS Protocol. I know that I did a mistake. I just wanted to heal myself, because I was sure that my Thyroid is not good. A repeat 5 cycles, and even one symptom did not go away. So... it's logical that T3 hormone supplements didn't work, because my main failure is pituitary gland and its hormones.  For those both low levesl of T3 and T4 - Is this possible, that this is for what I have done (T3 tablets)? And which one, T4 or T3 has to be higher, if it is T3 use cause?  I also think that my TSH (before- at my primary doctor blood test was 2.3 has lowered from 2.3 to 0.043 for that reason too? Am I right?  I'm afraid that I did a horrible mistake, or ..didn't I? -I have noticed after taking T3 cycles, that all my symptoms are still the same, but one get worse - cold sensetive to my feet! So...It's got worsen. Now, every day I do not have just cold feet, but ICE-COLD feet. Do you think   this is because my T3 usage mistake? What to do?  And the last thing, my another symptom: it's some kind of sores on my penis just below gland penis on the left side of outer foreskin layer. Those sores I have for about 3 years, and any kind of ointment did not heal my problem. There are actually a few days severe sores that makes a little pain (light 'sting') and then follows the mild feelings. So, what do you think that this sign (symptom) is for?  Dr. Chan Lowe., thank you for answering me and taking your time.  Regards,  Luke\n\n",

    "content": "T3 and T4 are both hormones used by the body.  T4 tends to be the more physiologically active hormone.  Generally, if hypothyroidism is present, T4 will be used to supplement.  There are some rare conditions where T3 cannot be converted to T4; however, in these cases the T3 level is high and the T4 is low.  I would recommend that you have your TSH and free T4 tested to see where your hormone levels are.  At this point, if you are hypothyroid I would recommend using a T4 supplement (such as levothyroxine which is synthetic T4).  Your sores may also be related to hypothyroidism (if you are hypothyroid).  Hypothyroidism causes slow and poor healing of wounds.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I am a 26 year old female. I have always been in good heath. I noticed towards the end of last year that I have a ugly hard bump on the top of my back just under my neck, right in the middle. It is hard, almost feels like a bone. I did a search on it and I got, \"Buffalo hump.\" Is a Buffalo hump hard? I read it is a fatty area, so does that mean its suppost to be soft? I also have been getting bad headaches (different headaches than my normal ones) and a sore neck from it.  I also came across, Cushings when doing the search about buffalo hump.\" I have gain about 50-55 pounds in less than two years (I think most if not all has gone to my stomach) even though my eating habits haven't changed. I take my kids on a walk frequently. (I'm not sitting on my butt all day eating bon-bons...lol) I just figures it was cause I'm getting older and have had three kids. But this search has got me wondering. I am a divorced single mom of two and I am living off child support with no heath insurance. So just going in for questions sounds very costly to me. Please help me decide if I should go in to see a doctor or if it's nothing to worry about. oh I just noticed I need to include the following- I am on no medication. I have had no past surgeries. The only past diagnoses I have had is an ovary cyst last summer and I also have refux. My family history is all clear except for some cancer (My mom had breast cancer and my grandpa prostate.)\n\n",

    "content": "I am 55, female and have had an under-active thyroid since my 1st child was born 38 years ago. (My mother has a goiter but never on thyroid pills) Since then I have been on thyroid hormone (mostly synthetic). I was doing fairly well, but in 2000 my doctor said he thought I would feel a lot better on natural hormone instead of Synthroid, so we changed my pills. I started to get chest pains. They would come & go in waves. He tried to switch me back to the Synthroid, but I still got really bad chest pains. He tried every other kind of thyroid on the market and they all gave me chest pains. He thinks it may have happened because I was also taking Tamoxifen at the time after a lumpectomy & radiation for breast cancer, since it also has an effect on the hormones. (I have been cancer free since 1997) We stopped all thyroid, and then I started getting severe chest pains on antibiotics for sinus infections.  I finally stopped the Tamoxifen after 4 years instead of 5 to see if that would help. I still get chest pain on certain antibiotics (thankfully I found a few I can still take!) but still can not get back on thyroid hormone. I am so tired now, after 7 years, I am almost bed-ridden! I can hardly get my breath when I walk, my legs feel like lead weights & I cannot stand for long. Doctors look at me like they have never heard of this, like I'm the only person in the world that has ever had this happen. I am desperate!!!  Does anyone have any idea what's happening to me???  Thank you so much for any help you can give me. If I don't soon get back on thyroid I'm afraid I will never get out of bed!\n\n",

The big question is what is causing your chest pain.  You may want to see a cardiologist for some testing.  It is possible that when you are on the thyroid medicine your metabolic demand is increasing back to normal and making the heart work a bit harder leading to chest pain.  Continued follow up with your endocrinologist is also important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 23 year old female.  Up until this time last year I was a seemingly healthy individual.  I then came down with a very severe respiratory infection and was hospitalized for a week.  Before being discharged the doctors told me my labs showed I had hyperthyroidism.  I was released without treatment and told to see an endocrinologist within a few weeks.  A week later I was back in the ER with horrible heart palps and a heart rate over 180.  I was placed on a beta blocker and given PTU.  I started receiving treatment from an endo. from there on out.  My labs have showed I have been in the hyper range from that point until December, when I came down with pneumonia and was hospitalized again.  This time my labs began showing I was hypothyroid (and I definetely had most of the significant symptoms of this).    My medication was reduced, and since mid January my labs show that my thyroid condition has been in remission.  Anyways a few weeks back I started feeling funny.  I was extremly hot (even in 20/30 degree weather), I was shaking and trembling (especially at night), my hair was coming out in huge chunks, and my heart rate was now hard and fast.  I called the endocrinologist and he ran the thyroid panel.  He called this week and said they all came back normal (I wont be able to see the actual results until next week).  He gave me no such help whatsoever as to what may be physically causing these symptoms.  In fact he pretty much suggested it was anxiety.  Now please note I have been treated for anxiety since this all began, mostly because of the fast, irregular heart rate that I have had throughout.  I have responded well to the medication and have seen a therapist for over a year.  Now the suggestion that this is mental, is really upsetting to me.  I haven't been under stress, and in fact things have been very good until all these things started.  In fact my psychiatrist has said that he thinks this is not a mental reaction.  Mentally I feel fine, but physically I feel like my body will not slow down.  I shake so bad that I cannot fall asleep at night, and have the sensation that I want to go for a run in the middle of the night.  I am not sure what to do, I am very frustrated.  I am stuck in an HMO with one endocrinologist, who has basically given me no advice, and a primary doctor who only wants to refer me to the endocrinologist for help.  I have a previously scheduled appt. for next week with the endo.  to see if there is any help I can get.   Is there any advice you could provide me with, I would really appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you very much doctor.  I had an appointment with the endocrinologist this week, and he listened more carefully to my concerns, and had the opinion that the symptoms do suggest hyperthyroidism, especially given my history with the disease.  He is running the labs again next week.  Also, he is running the catecholamines test, looking for possible Pheochromocytoma as I fit the symptoms for that as well.  My heart rate has been out of control this week similar to my first hyperthyroidism episode.  I have showed repeat episodes of HRs over 160 in my primary and cardiologists offices that remained steady for over two hours.  The cardiologist ran EKGs and find only sinus tachycardia, so they think an endocrine problem is causing all this.  My endocrinologist has referred me to the University of Chicago hospitals to see a specialist who is an expert in these disorders as he also speculates that it could be a number of problems that he is not familiar with or how to treat.  Thank you again for your advice, and I hope to get this all resolved.\n\n",

If some thyroid tissue was left, it would be possible for that tissue to expand resulting in a goiter returning.  I would recommend that your mother be evaluated and have her thyroid hormone levels checked.  If they are normal, she may need to have some imaging studies done to look for what is causing the swelling.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 20 year old female. My doctor thinks that I could possibly have PCOS as suggested from an U/S. However, it was never confirmed for sure. I have had blood work done and she said the hormone levels could support that diagnosis but could also be caused by other things. Should I see a gynecologist or an endocrinologist for this? It is the symptoms of it that are what bothers me, like the hirsutism, irregular periods, extra weight, as well as pelvic pain. I know I would see a gyn for fertility purposes, but for the treatment of symptoms, wouldn't it be better to see a endocrinologist, since they deal with hormones and metabolism. Thanks in advance.\n\n",

I didn't pay any real attention, but a about 2 weeks ago i felt some pain around it.I went to see an MD and she had me do a blood test.The tests came pretty normal. she asked me to wait 2 weeks and then if the lump didnt go away, she would perform a biopsy(FNS)...I'm kind of worried, especially that the blood picture was normal, and i didnt feel anymore pain in it since the first time i did. Do i really need to do the biopsy? If the blood tests are normal , what could be the problem that might have caused this lump to appear? N.B. The lump hadn't changed in size since i first noticed it. Thanks again for ur time.  Nada(21 years of age)\n\n",

    "content": "What you are describing sounds like a typical lymph node that has become somewhat enlarged and tender due to fighting off an infection.  The location for such a node fits where you are describing feeling it.  Typically, these nodes begin to shrink and the pain goes away after a few days to several weeks.  The node may or may not shrink back down to its original size but the tenderness should go away.  Before doing a fine needle biopsy I would recommend giving it several weeks unless there is something about it that is concerning (such as being very hard and immobile or rapidly getting larger).

    "content": "Hello,  I\u2019ve reached my big 40 three months ago and noticed a handful of grey hair and some wrinkles on my face, other than that I\u2019m very healthy.  I read that taking HGH supplement can help to slow down the aging effect, and can restore dark hair color and reduce wrinkles.  There are lots of HGH supplement products on the market and I\u2019ve been cautioned that most are really ineffective.  I came across an HGH product which claims to have bovine pituitary extract in a capsule, acting as HGH releaser.  I wonder if bovine pituitary extract in a capsule form would stimulate more HGH release, and that it would be safe to take everyday?  What about risk of prions disease from taking the inhfected dried extract in a capsule?  Or this supplement of bovine pituitary extract is a waste of money, and that I should just let myself age gracefully, as they say?  My other concern is that recently I\u2019ve grown another 2 inches since graduating from college when I was 25, as I can no longer fit into the pant I wore for graduation back then \u2013 it\u2019s short .  I read that the epiphyseal (sp.?) plates close in early twenties and I would stop growing.  I don\u2019t eat red meat, but take full spectrum amino acids supplement everyday to make up for the protein intake.  My facial & body proportion look normal as it has been, but is it abnormal that I\u2019ve grown taller in my late 30?  Should I see a doctor about this?  Thanks much.  Thomas\n\n",

With our knowledge today of prion disease I would have to say that this could be a risky situation.  You are correct that the growth plates close shortly after the completion of puberty.  At this point, not much growth should take place.  If you are still growing you should consider seeing an endocrinologist for some testing such as an x-ray of your hand to look at bone conditions.

    "content": "Hi unnat, I would suggest an evaluation to identify if an underlying disorder, ie, hormone, etc. is present. Keep in mind that while some have an abundance of facial hair early on others may develop it at a later onset. If there were no delay in other aspects of puberty, I would be inclined to consider an underlying condition. However, if there were delays in typical aspects of puberty's expected timeframes, ie, growth spurts, genital development, etc. then the lack of facial hair may be on delay as well. As always, have an evaluation by your physician to assure you are healthy. Keep in mind as well that many men would envy what you consider the lack of :) Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I started with deep pain in my legs, hips, and knees. I thought it might be a blood clot due to my smoking and being on birth control.   From there I have developed severe pain in my hands, feet, ankles, knees, and elbows all with mild redness and swelling. Heart palpitations and chest pain with jaw pain that they suspect is SVT's. A bounding pulse. Numbness and tingling in my hands and feet, particularly with temp changes, migraines, skin changes, telangiectasia on my arms, hands, lips, and face. breathing restrictions, fluctuating weight, hot/cold sensitivity, night sweats, hot flashes, the whites of my nails are turning pink and or disappearing, fatigue, and dry mouth and eyes.  My doctor suspected thyroid problems and did some labs. My tsh was right in the middle my T4 was high and my T3 was very low. Prior to this only my T4 was high but only very slightly. The doctor said she thinks I have hashimotos but am hyperthyroid.   Is she confused or is this type of lab response something that occurs early in hashimotos prior to they thyroid fully hitting a failing point.   I still feel like they are missing something. Some symptoms seem to match and some do not.\n\n",

    "content": "I think there may be more to the story.  TSH is the best marker for proper amounts of thyroid hormone in the body.  If the TSH is normal the body is not sensing a need for more or less thyroid hormone.  If you did not have a free T4 level tested that would be helpful to check.  Free T4 is the active hormone in the body (mostly).  I suspect in your case your Free T4 is normal and your other labs (T4 and T3) are off due to varying amounts of binding protein in the blood.  In regards to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, it can present as hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or normal thyroid depending on the phase that the disease is in.  Ultimately most Hashimoto's patients end up hypothyroid as the thyroid gland burns out.  Your symptoms are very suspicious for a rheumatologic problem.  I would suggest you see a rheumatologist and continue down that path.  Of note, most but not all lupus patients have a positive ANA.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Serum proteins are generally 50-60% albumin, and also include globulins, and other proteins.   A normal A/G ratio is around 1.1 to 1.8.  A ratio of 2.2 is not unusual with some health conditions.  Your care provider may be monitoring the level to determine if it is improving over time.

    "content": "Dear Anjalika,  Having a mildly elevated tsh, and whether or not to treat is can be a debatable and controversial issue sometimes.  Some will not treat patients for such a mild elevation especially if they are not symptomatic and they do not have any other manifestations of under active thyroid such as a high cholesterol level.  If a patient is hypothyroid, then there is a lifelong commitment to take thyroid replacement therapy to compensate for the deficient thyroid hormone in the body. i think that side effects of thyroid hormone replacement is because of excess dose rather than taking the medication at the prescribed dose.  If you don't want to take thyroid hormones for life, especially that you are still young, you can discuss it with your doctor and may be you can ask him/her to refer you to an endocrinologist for a second opinion.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and I hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 37 year old female.  I am currently taking 3 grams Armour each day.  My doctor started me on this medication last year to resolve mulitiple systems associated with apparent thyroid disorder. (TSH was within normal range, positive antibodies)   My dose was initially increased to as high as 4 grams, but lowered to the current dose of 3 grams due to negative side effects.  I have been on the current dose of 3 grams for the last 8 months.   For that entire time I have not had follow up blood work until last week when I had a wellness exam for my Insurance.  These tests came back with a TSH of .02.  This would appear to be well out of the normal range.  I feel fine, but am concerned that this level may cause health problems if I do not change my medication levels.  Is it harmful to remain at a level this low?\n\n",

    "content": "I am 32 years old, married, I have a 14 year old son from a previous marriage, I have been dx with postprandial hypoglycemia, for which I was put on Precose TID, during meals to slow the absorption of sugar,  I went to see my gyn, being married again now for almost two years, my new husband would like to have a child of his own, which I believed to be the right step, given my age and all, I have always had irregular periods from the time I was 14, and was put on BC pills to regulate this. I went to see my OBGYN, because I got off the BC pills and just wanted a check up, and to ask if my age was an issue for getting pregnant, which she says it's not. After the check up and various test, she told me it's a possibility that I have \"Polycystic Ovarian Cystitis\", and I would be placed on Metformin 500 QD to help with getting pregnant, the OBGYN called my endocrinologist to discuss, taking me off the Precose and to replace with Metformin. This was ok'd by my endo. What I am worried, or maybe terrified  is my BS dropping too low, there are times I am at work at my BS is in the 40's, since being on the Precose If my BS drops in the 60's now I feel awful, so the Precose lets me know now when I am in the 60-80 range, and I can catch my BS from getting too low, for this  I just eat some peanut butter, juice or a whole meal, and continue on, sometimes I have to go home but not very often. I work in a hospital and am a medical assistant, so I am very aware and have seen the results of low blood sugar.  This decision makes no sense too me.\n\n",

    "content": "Precose works to slow the breakdown of carbohydrates in the intestine causing slower absorption of the sugars.  This reduces the insulin spike that occurs with high blood sugars and can help prevent post-prandial hypoglycemia.  Metformin is thought to have a similar mechanism of action in the GI tract but also senstitizes the body to insulin, decreases glucose production from the liver.  Often, hypoglycemia is not a major problem with metformin; however, it is more likely than with precose.    In addition, metformin has been shown to help some women with PCOS ovulate.    I would recommend you talk with your gynecologist to be sure she was aware of your post-prandial hypoglycemia.  You will likely do well with the metformin but it will be important to be aware of the symptoms of hypoglycemia and watch for them closely once you start the metformin to ensure it will be OK for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

How long would it take someone who has been taking Oxycontin 40mg a day for a year and short acting Vicoden once a day for 20 years to restore normal hormonal levels (I am titrating off the oxy starting today)? I realize there are other possibly causes that would alter hormone levels. My testosterone is 190 and dhea 60 and estrogen 185 and I am 51 years old. I will test for these hormone levels after I am completely off the narcotics but was not sure how long it would take for my body to get back to homeostasis (normal or not)? Is 1 week, 3 weeks, 3 months? Just an approximate time before I retest is all I am asking. My GP MD does not know the answer to this and also does not even think they will change at all as a result of stopping the prescribed Oxycontin.  Phoenix AZ\n\n",

    "content": "Narcotics have been well documented to cause decreases in testosterone levels.  The exact mechanism of this is not known.  Regarding how long it will take to recover after being off the narcotics varies depending on the narcotic.  Methadone has a half-life that gets longer as usage time increases.  It can range up to eight days according to some reports.  Based on first order kinetics (the simplest method, but methadone may not follow this rule) it take 5 half lives for a substance to reach steady state and presumably 5 half-lives to drop back down.  Would be about 40 days.  This is a complete estimation as I do not know the actual kinetics of methadone.  As the methadone level drops, testosterone level should come back up.  I use methadone as an example because it has a long half life.  Most other narcotics have shorter half-lives and will clear faster.  I hope this helps some.  Best wishes.

    "content": "Female, 49, little relevant family history.  Menopausal; just now beginning work with Endocronologist and Kinesiologist/nutritionist.  I have just discovered a pronounced lump on my sternum bone, that is actually pretty sore.  is is approx. 1 inch by 2 inches, soft tissue, about 1/2 in raised.  History:  After suffering for 2+ years with various menopausal issues (which now I better understand)  I have sought to find help.  Initially a doctor put me on Effexor, which helped with somethings but I hated the side effects and I weaned myself off.  I then decided to try dietary changes and supplements and have begun to feel better.  Symptoms are as such:  post menstrual 2+ years; have significant trouble with sleep (wake every night @ 3:30 AM, awake for hours, then dead tired); chronic headaches; sinus issues that present like allergy; I gained 20+ pounds several years ago for no real reason, then around 5+ for each of last years, weight is a real problem; typical menopause symptoms like hot flashes, anxiety, depression.  Stress had become a real problem, given the lack of sleep and other issues, but I have gotten that under greater control. Supplements and some herbs have helped (ginsing, St. John's Wort, cordeceps).  Working with Kinesiologist, he has put me an \"Ultrameal 360, which helps with metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance) to help me lose weight because I have not had any success even though I eat less than 1500 calories, all good calories, and my regular maintenance would be around 2200 / day.  The endocronologist, whom I will see again in about 1 month, has put me on Iodine supplement, as he was pleased with the other supplements (don't mess with what works yet  but the intent is to get off the herbs at least).  He also put me on Progesterone 40 cream (1 gram).  I just went onto a antibiotic because I had a sinus infection, because I couldn't shake it after 2 weeks.  I still have the sleep issues, headaches  So, long winded.  The iodine, Ultrameal and progesterone cream are all new for me this week, as is the antibiotic.  I'm wondering if this lump could be a reaction to something, or some combination.  I saw one entry here that suggests some lymph node swelling - perhaps from the sinus infection?  I'm just a bit nervous, I realize now that I shouldn't have added all of this at the same time.\n\n",

I sweat badly all over my body if I am slightly hot, feel any stress or strong emotion,  etc.  I have seen a few dermatologists who don't really know what to do.  I have seen one endocrinologist who simply gave me a pep talk and did not run any diagnostic tests.     I recently discovered that my estradiol levels are in the post menopausal reference range (<60 pmol/L).  My luteinizing hormone level is <1 IU/L and my follicle stimulating hormone  level is <1 IU/L, which is on the low side.  My progesterone levels are 1.0 IU/L and my prolactin levels are 9 ug/L, which I think is normal.     I am currently taking Ortho Ovral as an oral contraceptive and that is my only medication currently.  Are my hormone levels abnormally low for a woman taking oral contraception and could this be responsible for my sweating and heat intolerance?    My family doctor does not have much expertise in this area, so I need a specialist's opinion.  Please note there does not appear to be any thyroid related problem or any kind of vitamin/mineral deficiency.  My doctors have ruled out many potential causes for the hyperhidrosis.  Please offer any suggestions or recommendations for treatment.    Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm by no means an expert in this area; however, your FSH, LH and estradiol levels are likely to be as expected while on oral contraceptives.  LH and FSH respond to the body sensing a need for higher hormone levels.  Their production is inhibited by the presence of estrogen.  Estradiol is made by the ovary in the presence of LH and FSH.    Since oral contraceptives often contain different forms of estrogen (rather than estradiol), the estrogen from the pill will not be picked up by the blood test, making it appear that you have low estrogen levels.  The LH and FSH are suppressed by the exogenous estrogen.  Your symptoms are compatible with estrogen deficiency, though there may be other causes as well.  It is possible that your oral contraceptive may not have enough estrogen in it to suppress your symptoms.  Many of the newer oral contraceptives have micro dose estrogens in them.  Here's where my knowledge ends: I do not know if your body being symptomatic from estrogen deficiency would be able to sense this and cause the ovaries to make more estrogen, thus raising your estradiol level.  It is quite possible that the exogenous estrogen is a potent enough inhibitor to keep FSH and LH levels down even in the face of overall lack of sufficient estrogen.  I would recommend that you talk with your gynecologist, or perhaps with your endocrinologist again to get a more knowledgeable answer.  Hope this helps some.\n\n",

Tests for antibodies were negative (thyroblob < 20, ref:  < 25; microsomal 1.4, ref:  0.- 2.0).  I was tested again in August of 2006 with the following results.  THS = 2.54, thyroid peroxidase antibodies 10 (ref:  < 35).  At this time it was noted that my thyroid was slightly enlarged.  Both doctors (my GP and an endocrinologist) indicated that my thyroid was functioning normally.  However, I seem to have a lot of the symptoms of hypothyroidism, including problems with blood sugar regulation (reactive hypoglycemia), paresthesia, and an extreme sensitivity to cold.  Recently I noticed that the bottom part of each eyebrow is missing, which I\u2019ve read can be a sign of hypothyroidism.  I\u2019m also losing eyelashes at an alarming rate.  I\u2019ve read postings on this site and others that state that a TSH over 2.5 is most likely indicative of a problem.  How does one go about finding a doctor who will treat an elevated TSH that\u2019s below the cutoff of 5.00?  I wonder if this is something worth pursuing (I don\u2019t think it will be easy), or are my numbers really within normal parameters?  Thanks,\n\n",

It is possible for one to have an elevated TSH and a normal T4.  In your case, both the TSH and T4 are normal.  This makes thyroid dysfunction extremely unlikely.    You may consider having some of your other hormones checked, such as cortisol and growth hormone.  Decrease amounts of these hormones, particularly cortisol, can lead to many similar symptoms of hypothyroidism.  Cortisol deficiency can lead to hypoglycemia as it is one of the hormones that counteracts insulin.  Regarding finding a doctor that will treat hypothyroidism in you, I can't be of any help.  I'm not aware of any.  Sorry.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "Reactive hypoglycemia uncontrollable through diet",
    "content": "I am a 42 year old female diagnosed with reactive hyperinsulinemia/hypoglycemia that I have not been able to control with dietary modifications (i.e., I cannot tolerate more than about 10 grams of carbohydrate per meal).  My problem seems to be continual rapid changes in blood sugar, even when I stick to the recommended low carb diet, rather than absolute lows.  I have had this since childhood, but it really got out of control within that past few years, resulting in memory/concentration problems and affective instability in particular.  I should note that my maternal grandfather had what appeared to be an identical syndrome, which was never diagnosed or effectively treated.    I have had pretty much every test in the book at this point and everything looks normal, with the exception of an extreme reaction to a 5-hour glucose tolerance test (shaking, sweating, nausea) showing rapid declines in blood glucose by hour 3 (this was in 2001) and slightly elevated potassium (for the past few months).  Last fall I had a CT scan to check for a pancreatic tumor, which was negative (not surprising since my fasting insulin level is normal).  After that round of testing, my endocrinologist gave the diagnosis of reactive hyperinsulinemia and told me to act as though I was allergic to carbohydrates.  Following that advice, I rigidly adhered to a no carb diet for three weeks.  I felt wonderful mentally (I could think clearly for the first time in years and my mood was much more stable).  Unfortunately, my body could not handle ketosis, or at least I think that was what happened.  By the end of the third week of the no carb diet every muscle in my body ached, my body temperature dropped, and I was freezing cold all of the time.  I also lost flexibility in my ankles and, to some extent, in my wrists.  Then my feet, hands and tongue went numb, and my stomach stopped working (2% gastric emptying at 140 minutes).  This was about 4 \u00bd months ago.  Since then (I started eating carbs again as soon as I made the connection-- at the end of about week three on the diet), my neurological symptoms have remitted.  My gastric emptying was no longer delayed as of last month, and my feet etc. were starting to feel normal.  But I was back to not being able to think and the mood swings.  I went to another endocrinologist last month who looked only at my fasting blood glucose and insulin levels and said that nothing was wrong.  Although she didn\u2019t think it would do much, she did, however, give me a prescription for Metformin.  I started that about 10 days ago (500 mg) and it\u2019s like a miracle.  I can tolerate carbohydrates.  I don\u2019t have to eat every 2- 2 \u00bd hours, and I can think clearly.  (Regular glucose monitoring  also shows that my blood sugar now stabilizes at about 100, rather than continuing down into the low 70s\u2014the level at which I would start to sweat, shake, etc.).  This is great, but my feet and hands are starting to get numb again, and I continually have the chills.   Thus, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m heading back down the path I went with the no carb diet.      Have you ever encountered anyone with a similar set of symptoms, and do you have any recommendations as to what I might do next?  Is it significant that the Metformin seems to be so effective in stabalizing my blood sugar (i.e., what might that tell me about the underlying nature of my condition)?  I realize that this service is not designed as a replacement for a doctor\u2019s visit, but any insight you could provide would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Your symptoms that you describe are consistent with episodic hyperinsulinemia and resulting low blood sugars.  I'm not an endocrinologist, so it is very likely that I am simply not knowledgeable in this area enough to understand the reasoning behind using metformin.    My understanding of metformin is that it reduces the livers production of glucose and makes the body more sensitive to insulin. These things would tend to drive blood sugars lower (hence its use in insulin resistant diabetes mellitus).  I am not aware of it having any effects on raising/stabilizing blood sugars.  One thought would be to discuss with your doctor some medications that help blunt the effect of insulin, such as diazoxide.  I have used this medication before in children with hyperinsulinism.  It does have some side effects, so monitoring by your doctor is important.  Again, I'm not an endocrinologist so take my recommendations with a grain of salt.  Hope this helps some.\n\n",

I don't trust this Endo at all.  You can trust her as I don't see she has done/adviced anything wrong. Maybe its a miscommunication or maybe you weren't convinced with her explaination.  Its the PCOS (which is a fairly common condition) you need to concentrate upon as of now and not slightly high sugar levels (atleast not as of now).  The weight and fairly good lipid profile are the factors in your favour. You can always keep a watch on the sugar levels in your subsequent visits, that too, only if adviced. Your endocrinologist is the best judge as she personally examines you.   Also, regular exercise can bring down the sugar levels drastically, if those still concern you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have exhausted all outlets to shed some light on my symptoms.  Over a year ago ( Oct)  I  presented with bounding heart and hypertension and was placed on Toporol 25 mg daily.  Two months later no change so we proceded with  the following exams - a EKG, 24 hr urine , KOH, and Echo - nothing remarkable; although the CT showed a small nodule on thyroid. No action was taken at the time. Appox. four months later I developed anxiety and was placed on Lexapro - I had a severe reaction noted as,\" Serotonin Flushing\";Paxil, and Zoloft had same effects ( oddly, three years before I had successfully taken Zoloft and Paxil with no reaction. ) Shortly after, I started to experience hair loss and a signigicant weight loss. TSH blood work came back as normal.  In November an additional 24 hr urine was done and there was a slight elevation of T3 and low BUN - Nuc Med and Ultrasound were done with nothing remarkable.  I was diagnosed with Anxiety - Panic disorder and placed on Xanax.  I have lost twenty pounds in the last two months,ongoing bounding heart, severe panic, hair loss, occasional palpitations and hypertension which rises signifigantly upon rising  from a resting of 120/82 to 145/95 - this is mild exertion ( moving from one room to the next) with shortness of breath, B/P of 175/109 with 20 min of areobic exercise. I feel as though someone has shot me full of Adrenaline 24/7, theses symptoms are ongoing.  I am 32, within weight peremiters, post menoposal ( TAH) four years ago from a septic infection, non smoker, non drinker and until this last year spent the previous quite healthy.  I have tried herbs, relaxation, medications and couselors and  these symproms persist.  Are my concerns unfounded? Should I seek a second opinion? Or is this classis of Panic Disorder? I am growing hopeless and exhausted with each attempt as my credibility is crumbling with each normal test.\n\n",

    "content": "I have had the same reaction from doctors...I can't tell you how many times I was told, \"You're depressed,\" or how many times I had to beg for blood tests.  Frankly, it's insulting and embarassing.  Not everyone who walks into the office is a complete idiot; I get that a lot out here on the east coast.  I'm sure doctors have to put up with many patients who feel that they know better because they read a WebMd article, and I'm sure there are a number of people who walk in clueless.  Another stressor, I think, is the number of patients doctors need to see in a day; insurance companies really do a lot of control over what does and does not happen.  Regardless of all that, I happen to be a highly qualified professional who is now in the process of graduate study at Columbia University and while that certainly doesn't make me any better than anyone else, it should indicate something about my ability to understand my body and mind.  Yet, when I walked into the office and described my symptoms, I either heard, \"I don't want you to become a hypochondriac,\" or, \"You've been doing some research, huh?\"  ARGH.  Yes.  Actually I have and I'm damn glad I did.  If I wasn't as pushy as I have been I would not have been diagnosed with Hashimoto's.  If the current state of affairs wasn't as it was, then maybe I wouldn't have to, but the truth is that, at one point, your family doctor was both knowledgable and free enough to help you.  Insurance companies have made a mess of it now and I can't balme the docs for having that reaction.  Nevertheless, I can't accept it as appropriate either.  Because I resolved to make sure that I found doctors whose philosophical approach was that of teamwork and mutual respect, I have found my way into the care of some excellent professionals.  Don't give up and don't settle.  If you aren't comfortable with your doctor, move on.  Discomfort exerts strain on the communication between the two of you, and that could lead to the suppression of information that needs to be shared for proper care.  You have to take responsibility for finding the right doctor; and s/he is out there.\n\n",

    "content": "Over the last couple years I seem to have developed ADD-like symptoms, along with some persistent anxiety and intermittent cognitive impairment. I was put on methylphenidate, but it made me feel horrible. I am wondering if it could be neurological complications of an endocrine problem; I am a 21 year old female, with a BMI of 25.5 (so slightly overweight).  I bruise spontaneously on my legs, bruises about the size of a silver dollar, reddish-purple, and slightly swollen. As they heal, they look like rings, the middle healing first, edges taking the longest to go away. I have had a complete blood count done, which was normal, and my coagulation was tested and normal.  My periods have become lighter, and I have some stretch marks on my breasts, under the arms, and some on my abdomen which are new, and I don't think they are related to weight gain (my weight has been pretty stable). I also feel like my breasts have regressed slightly, though it's very subtle.  I think I am hypertensive for my age (130's over 80's), though my doctors don't seem to think it means anything. I also have low muscle tone, and shortness of breath when I exercise.  I have considered diabetes, but I am neither constantly thirsty nor have I experienced unexplained weight loss. I have a couple floaters in my eyes, spidery-looking things which are annoying, but my optometrist thinks they're harmless; I think it's bizarre for someone my age to have them...  Other labs which might be of interest: I had my thyroid hormone checked, it was normal (T4 9.5 out a normal range of 4-12 ug/DL, TSH 1.86 out of a normal range of .4-4.7 uIU/mL). I thought I could have a parathyroid problem - my calcium was 10 (normal range being 8-10.3 mg/DL according to the lab); I was not on a calcium supplement at the time. I have also considered a Cushing's Syndrome, but my potassium was normal (4.4, range 3.6-5.1 mmol/L), and glucose was normal (98 on a normal scale of 73-118 mg/DL).  I am waiting on the results of a brain MRI, which I had taken as a precaution. I would appreciate any input.  Thanks,  Alex\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I will try to respond to some of the earlier posts and hopefully give you all a better understanding of this condition.  Puffy nipples in a male may involve an abnormality of the nipple, areola, or surrounding area. The nipple is composed of glandular component, a fat component and a muscular component all of which can become distorted to produce puffy nipples.   To explain a few points made by some of the earlier responses, gynecomastia (one of the causes of puffy nipples) is a benign enlargement of the male breast resulting from a proliferation of the glandular component of the breast. The presence of gynecomastia can easily been spotted clinically by your doctor since they manifest as hard round discs that occur beneath the areola and lead to enlargement of the nipples (puffiness). They are very important to exclude since they could be the result of a serious hormonal imbalance.  The causes of gynecomastia include decreased production of testosterone, exposure to estrogens or androgens (such as those used by body builders), some medications (such as eplerenone, ACE-inhibitors, and phenytoin. Chronic liver disease, kidney failure, and sometimes marijuana use can lead to gynecomastia. Rare causes include genetic abnormalities, tumors, or hyperthyroidism.  However, the most common cause of gynecomastia is normal puberty. This is why many of the posters above were told to wait.  Regarding the members that mentioned that their puffiness goes away in the cold that is caused by contraction of the muscular component of the nipple leading to a decrease in its size and normalization of the contour.  Sometimes puffy nipples have an increased fat component not glandular component (as in gynecomastia). These cases need to be assessed by a doctor (plastic surgeon) to determine if they require surgical removal of the fat component or not. This can have dramatic effects as mentioned in one of the posts above.  All of this emphasizes the need to get an evaluation by a doctor. I hope this information has helped.\n\n",

Sweat secretion is acidic with a ph from about 4 to 5.5 (mildly acidic) that is of the skin.  The ph differs slightly from one part to another, and is more acidic where staphylococcal infection is present.  The fact that your sweat secretion causes this bleaching effect, means that it has more acidic ph.  Acid wastes from the body are excreted in the urine and the sweat secretion.  Certain types of food and metabolic disorders like DM my result in acidosis.  I advise you o seek direct clinical examination. Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "\"Little c\"",
    "content": "Melissa:  I don't know exactly what \"little c\" stands for, but I have an idea that they were referring to blood type.  If your blood type is Rh negative, and your baby's blood type is Rh positive, then your body develops antibodies to the Rh positive blood type.  The antibodies are harmless to you, but can be very harmful to a growing fetus in subsequent pregnancies.  Antibodies are a substance that your immune system develops to protect you from foreign substances, meaning anything that shows up that matches up with the antibody.  It's a lot like a lock-and-key, if the antibody is the lock, and the foreign substance is the key.  So, if your next baby is Rh positive, then your antibodies to Rh positive could attack the baby.  Since I don't know any more of the details of your specific situation, I can't really comment on their advice that you might not want to get pregnant again.  You should definitely consult your obstetrician for advice about future pregnancies.  Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "I am hoping someone can help me. I have questions regards to Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and the use of Metformin. I am of almost 43 year old woman. I am overweight by about 110 pounds and have belly fat (I gained alot when pregnant, however my son is a teenager and I weigh more now than when I was pregnant. I weighed 120 when I became pregnant). It seems to me I have a hard time losing weight. My periods are sporadic. This started after I went off the pill about 14 years ago. Sometimes I have 2 in a row and sometimes go for months and months without one. My hair is fine and thinner on the top (our whole family has thin hair). I have sporadic facial hair on my chin and neck that I pluck daily. This started out with one hair about 14 years ago and just has increased. Not a beard or anything. I had an ultrasound about 9 years ago and had 3 cysts on my right ovary and they couldn\u2019t find my left ovary. On my most recent ultrasound (serves me right) they said no cysts and this time couldn\u2019t find my right ovary. Which makes no since to me. I may be wrong on what ovary they couldn\u2019t find but in any event they said no cysts this last ultrasound. My latest blood test was normal on sugar and basically everything else- I think my good cholesterol was slightly low and my bad ~a hair above normal. I can\u2019t find the test right now but I know my cholesterol was alittle off but nothing to go on meds for. I eat very healthy and try to work out~but only seriously working out recently. I do not smoke or drink. My sister is on med for PCOS but not Metformin. My currant physician when I asked about whether I had PCOS ( I had to bring it up to her) asked if I wanted to go on birth control. I said no and then she put me on Metformin. I had some questions but I felt she never gave me any answer~just take the meds it will help you lose weight. So I have some questions and hope someone can help. Please if someone can answer my 4 questions.  I have not taken the Metformin because I am afraid too. I do not like to take medication but will if I need to. I am trying to lose weight and I am working very hard on it. I will take the Metformin if it will help.  1. Does it sound like I have PCOS? I know there is no specific test  2. How does Metformin (Glucophage) help those with PCOS. What exactly does it do as opposed to someone with Diabetes. Does it do something different? How does it help someone with PCOS? 3. If I DO NOT have PCOS, will taking Metformin harm me? Will it lower my blood sugar to be too low? 4. The side effects scare me. Do I have to take a B vitamin supplement? (my Dr said she knew nothing about vitamin B depleting). And lactic acidosis scares me.  Thank you for your help, Lisa\n\n",

Cause of  PCOS are not known yet and diagnosis is confirmed by Abdominal US in addition to the other labs. Although the US could not identify the cysts in your ovary the last time, but it is still possible.  Between 4% and 7% of women of PCOS  produce high level of male hormone testosterone in their ovaries. Recently, it has been shown that some of them they also have high insulin hormone levels to overcome the increased resistance to insulin's effects.  Some studies have shown that Metformin may be considered to lower body weight in obese non-diabetic patients as it inhibits food intake, they can be beneficial also in PCOS as it improved menstrual patterns in addition to the body weight.   High doses (unusually not that dose used for weight reduction) may cause lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia, you should however be aware of these symptoms and to inform your  Doctor immediately when you feel them ( like drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, tremors).  Vitamin B12 supplement may be prescribed by your Doctor during Meformine therapy.  Best regards.\n\n",

DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone) is secreted by the adrenal gland and is a precursor to male and female sex hormones.   DHEA levels are known to decrease after the age of 30. Thus a mild isolated elevation of DHEA should be taken with caution.   Your symptoms are non specific and  can be shared with many diseases. Isolated rise in the level of DHEA is reported in patients with cushing disease in which individuals have increase in body weigh, hirsutism, amenorhea, etc (which you do not have).  I advise you to repeat the blood test for DHEA level and to follow up with your doctor.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I am 23 years old and i don't seem to be getting any answers. When i was 17 i had my FSH levels tested they were way off the scale at 126. Last year i had my FSH levels tested again and they had gone down to 43 or something. I was wondering if this was normal, whether it meant that my ovaries were starting to function again or if it was just the HRT that was giving this reading? The doctor seems to think that it is an antibody problem and has advised me to go back in two years to have blood tests for my thyroid. Its all so confusing. But still.   I know the chance of my ovaries working again are very slim, but if my FSH are going down then is there any hope??? and i have not had any assessment about my HRT as i have now been on them for nearly 7 years.  Thanks for reading!!  Stephyg\n\n",

    "content": "An initially elevated FSH level is consistent with ovarian failure, though this is not the only cause.  FSH is counterregulated by estrogen.  FSH stimulates estrogen production.  As the ovaries make estrogen, the pituitary gland senses the estrogen and decreases its production FSH.  (A little simplified but it works.)  If the ovaries are failing, the pituitary makes more and more FSH to try to induce estrogen production.  Once you start on hormone replacement, the pituitary senses this hormone and decreases the production of FSH, leading to a lower level.  A persistently elevated FSH in the presence of HRT would indicate a different disorder.  Unfortunately, if you do have ovarian failure it is unlikely that your ovarian function will return.  Regarding HRT, there are many, many choices. Keep working with your doctor to find one that works well for you with minimal side effects.  Regarding the antibody testing, ovarian failure may be due to an autoantibody the body is producing that attacks the ovaries.  When the body is making one autoantibody it not uncommonly will also make others.  So, testing thyroid function is an important step to look for autoimmune thyroid damage as well.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Back then I had a fever with it and was told it's an 'infection' and given an antibiotic, after using it I went for a check up and my blood tests  results were 'good', My mother told me that the same thing happened to me when I was a kid (doesn't remember my age). Even though after that I had no pain I could still feel 'something' bigger on the left side of my neck and sometimes it would hurt but only for a day or so.  This time the pain is right under my left ear down to the front of my throat but my whole left side hurt. and the left side of my neck is swollen. I went to the emergency room and the doctor said it's an 'infection' that's caused by another infection but my throat and ear are fine. He prescribed an antibiotic (Augmentin 1g) and I had a blood test that he said he would call if anything is wrong with it and since he didn't I assume everything is ok. (that was yesterday)   Today, I don't feel any better and I also feel like I'm choking and have difficulty breathing which might cause more problems since I used to have Asthma when I was young but it got better now and it's not as bad as it used to be.  What could be the cause of all this? and should I go see an endocrinologist for further tests?  Thank you.  P.S. My grandmother has some problems with her glands and she takes some medicine daily.\n\n",

You will be doing a thyroid scan to dtermine whether yoru thyroid gland is very active ,hypo-active or normally functioning but it is just getting bigger. you will also be asked to do a blood test called thyrpoid profile (TSH,FT3 and FT4).  It seems that you have something called multi nodular goitre which is enlargment of the thyroid gland ,but at the same time it forms nodules that get infected and causes you the fever. and you can feel choking because it presses on the trachea ofcourse.

For at least the last few months I have had an eraser sized bump on the back of my neck down, a little, and to the right of my ear, only on the left side (my GP believes it is a lymph node). Today, I touched under my chin and noticed the lymph nodes there are also eraser sized.  My doctor did not believe the one on the back of my neck was a problem, because it has not grown and is not discolored or sore. It also does not throb or move.   I am beginning to get concerned because while the node on the back of my neck has stayed the same size, it has not gone away.     I have type one diabetes (my specialist is comfortable with my control; I rarely have a BG  over 225), an anxiety disorder (which I take Paxil CR for), I have had mono, and I am a smoker (about a pack a day). I also get migraines, and lately have been random getting chills. For years, I have also gotten what I call \u201chead rushes\u201d (like when you eat something cold or stand up to quickly) when I am simply sitting still.  I do not have a sore throat, but I do have a consistent sinus infection (I think) and a constant cough. I do not currently have a fever.  The only other issue I can think of is that last spring for a couple of weeks I have an eraser sized bumb on my armpit, which did go away.  I would like to know: What could be the cause of my swelling? Is there anything I ought to specifically be concerned about, or that I should bring up with my doctor (tests?)?\n\n",

    "content": "Testosterone injections really are not needed until puberty.  They are indicated in testosterone deficiency to help boys complete puberty properly.  Too much testosterone too early can begin to induce some puberty like changes.  Most notably, growth can be induced and accelerated such that the bony growth plates close too soon, leaving children short as adults.  I would advise you have your son evaluated by your pediatrician and discuss your concerns with your doctor.  If the testosterone is not needed, it can be stopped and he should return to a prepubertal state as his body is not making testosterone at high levels yet.  But, an examination is important to ensure everything else is OK.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "Suspicious FNA findings",
    "content": "I am a 44 year old female in good health with an unremarkable health history.  Past knee surgery, no futher hospitalizations or serious illnesses.  I have been seeing my endocrinologist yearly to check on a right lobe nodule.  I recently went for my yearly check-up and was having some pain and discomfort on the opposite side of my neck, which I thought was my thyroid.  Doctor did an ultrasound, found my lymph nodes to be enlarged on left side and also found a smaller, new thyroid nodule (1.2 x 0.8 x 1.4 cm)  He wanted to give my lymph nodes a couple of weeks to calm down as I was coming down with bronchitis/flu and he felt that maybe that was the cause.  After a couple of weeks, I went for a FNA of both nodules.  He felt that the lymph nodes went down a bit and proceeded to do the FNA.  Results were as follows:  Larger right lobe nodule was placed in the benign catagory with a giagnosis of colloid nodule.  The left nodule revealed a rich mixed lymphocytic harvest representing an atypical lymphocytic proliferation.  It was placed in the suspicious catagory and they want to do flow cytometric analysis.  My doctor feels that there is no urgency in this and doesn't feel it is anything serious  , but I am going back in 2 weeks.  My question would be this:  is there anything other than lymphoma that would cause atypical lymphocytes in a thyroid nodule?  Could my recent bout with bronchitis/flu have anything to do with these findings?  My. doctor feels that even if it is lymphoma, it is so small it would be in it's infancy.  Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much.\n\n",

Some of the symptoms associated with this syndrome are for example, moon face, weight gain, frequent urination, acne, growth of facial hair, irregular or no menstrual cycle etc. Even though some of the symptoms of Cushings are also present in PCOS, the normal UFC would be one of the reasons, aside from the actual evaluation and presence of symptoms,  that the Endocrinologist suspects PCOS instead of Cushings. PCOS is treated with birth control medications and insulin sensitizing agents. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

According to the growth chart, this drops me from the 75th height percentile then to the 20th today. My brother and father are both tall (6 1' and 5 11' respectively) - my mother and sister are average height for women. How unusual is this, and could it have been caused by a hormonal deficiency? I am also having a lot of ED problems today, which may or may not be psychological.  Also, is this something my pediatrician should have done something about at the time? He noticed at one point that I'd \"stopped growing\" but said it was just normal and my body was \"done.\" Was that a reasonable/typical response?  Other sexual maturity characteristics - I have lots of pubic hair but almost no hair on the rest of my body (face, arms, legs, chest). I am very skinny and have a sleight build, narrow shoulders, and no muscles. I suffered some testicular trauma when i was 12 - my scrotum was punctured by a chain link fence and I received two stitches. I\u2019ve also had a lot of severe anxiety problems since adolescence.  Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.\n\n",

Delayed sexual development is defined as no testicular enlargement by 14 years of age or the passing of five years between the initial and complete development of the genitalia.   One of the causes is gonadal dysfunction. Since you have a history of trauma and surgery to testicles, this cause should be excluded.  In boys, hypogonadism results in lack of muscle and beard development and growth problems. In men the usual complaints are sexual dysfunction, decreased beard and body hair, breast enlargement, and muscle loss.  Tests include testosterone level (men) as well as FSH level and LH level, sperm count; blood tests for anemia.  Direct clinical examination is essential. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "cet9280:  I would speculate that your wife has a case of denial.  Many people in their twenties still feel \"immortal\" in some sense.  Your wife may be feeling insecure about her health, and inconsistent use of medicines is her way of proving to herself, and possibly to everyone else, that she is just fine.  The endocrinological system (hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenals) is one of those very important systems of the body that makes everything else work the way it is supposed to work.  That includes mental status.  I think that your wife's irrational behavior while off her medications makes perfect sense.  Consequences of not taking medicines as prescribed cover the spectrum from mild to serious.  Perhaps she needs some education about these issues.  If your wife is simply trying to avoid having to admit that she is ill, she should be reassured that a lot of people, even those in their twenties, have medical problems.  It's simply a fact of life.  I think it would be best for you to accompany your wife to her family doctor for a special appointment for the purposes of education.  While you're there, she can get a referral to see a new endocrinologist.  She needs to understand the potential consequences of not taking her medicine as prescribed.  Another possibility is that her medicines cause her to have side effects.  Often, patients are prescribed medication that they suffer side effects from and they don't say anything to their doctor about it because it doesn't occur to them that there may be a simple way to alleviate the side effects.  Then, the prescribing doctor doesn't know there is a problem, and the patient tends to have the idea that the doctor does not really care about them.  Best of luck to you and your wife.\n\n",

    "content": "Taking synthroid during pregnancy is very safe as long as you are being followed by your doctor.  It is not suprising that you seem to need more thyroid hormone during your early pregnancy since pregnancy can blunt the effects of the thyroid hormone (especially in the first trimester).  So, it is important to follow your TSH and Free T4 levels to guide treating your hypothyroidism.  Mothers who have their thyroid levels closely monitored and controlled go on to have wonderful pregnancies and babies.  An important question is why are you hypothyroid?  Did you have Graves disease and a subsequent thyroid ablation, or possibly Hashimoto's thyroiditis.  These two entities (and a few others) are antibody mediated.  So... Just because the thyroid in mom burns out and quits making thyroid hormone does not mean the antibodies go away.  This is a more significant issue in Grave's disease where the antibodies induce thyroid hormone production and thus hyperthyroidism.  These antibodies can cross the placenta and cause the infant's thyroid to overproduce.  Your pediatrician should be aware of your condition so they can be on the look out for your baby's symptoms.  At about 12 weeks gestation the baby's thyroid gland becomes active.  This will help minimize fluctuations resulting from mom's fluctuating thyroid hormone, so the first trimester time (before the baby can make thyroid hormone) is a crucial time to follow up with your doctor to make sure your levels are as good as possible.  (That is not to say that after 12 weeks mom's levels don't matter.  Unfortunately, it isn't quite that simple).  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I would generally say take them however upsets your stomach the least.  The iron in the PNV can occasionally cause slightly less absorption of the synthroid, but this can be adjusted for.  If you're taking them together and find you still don't have enough synthroid around to make your TSH normal, your doctor can increase the dose.  If you choose to take the separately, you may try taking one at night and the other in the morning.  (The order does not matter.)  After changes in thyroid hormone it takes about 2 weeks to see changes, so be sure to follow up with your doctor to be sure that you've got the right dose.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Sorry for the delay in response and hope this information will be helpful.  Your symptoms are very confusing because they can be shared with many diseases, at the same time they are not typical for any.  I agree with them your hormone test results are within the normal range, But they are more towards a low normal especially your thyroid results.  The thyroid gland produces primarily T4 with only scant amounts of T3. The majority of T3 present in the blood is produced by conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral (away from the thyroid) tissue, primarily the liver.   it is important that levels of FT3 be measured in patients exhibiting symptoms of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and normal T4 results.  Having a family history of SLE tests like ESR, CBC, Urine analysis, antinuclear antibody (ANA) test should be done although your symptoms are not typical.  It would be also helpful if you can inform us about the results of your CBC, Urine analysis, ESR, Coagulation profile and bleeding time test, kidney and liver function tests ( if any has been done). It would be also helpful if you can inform us about any medications taken prior to these symptoms, and if the current drugs improved any of these symptoms or your are getting worse.  There is no replacement for direct clinical ex,mination, I would advise you to follow up with your doctor, inform them that your symptoms are not improving and discuss with them this information.

    "content": "I have been having many symptoms that indicate possible adrenal insufficiency so I ordered a cortisol saliva test from Diagnos-Techs, Inc.  My results are as follows:  Time:\t                 Result:\t   Ref Range:  7:00-8:00 AM:\t2, \t (13-24 nM) 11:00-Noon:   \t<0.3, \t  (5-10 nM) 4:00-5:00 PM:\t<0.3,       (3-8 nM) 11:00-Midnight: \t<0.3, \t   (1-4 nM)  Cortisol Burden:\t2,                    (23 \u2013 42) DHEA:\t\t4,             (Adults (M/F): 3-10 ng/ml)  As you can see these results are severely depressed so I went ahead and scheduled an appt with my doctor.  He went ahead and ran a Cortisol Blood Serum test which was taken at 12:45PM.  I had also taken 2 grains of Armour Thyroid prior to the test.  The blood cortisol results are as follows:  CORTISOL:\t5.9 ----  REF RANGES~ (AM) 4.3- 22.4 UG/DL , (PM) 3.1 - 16.7 UG/DL  My questions are~  1. Which is seen as more effective and accurate, the saliva or the blood cortisol test?  2.Should I have additional testing done, if so what?  ACTH stimulation?  3.Would the fact that I had taken a dose of Armour Thyroid before my blood cortisol test have any influence on the result?  4.Even though the blood cortisol shows on the low end of normal, should I just accept that or should supplementation be an option?  Any thoughts or insight would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance!  ~Kelly 32 F Hypothyroidism Current Meds: Armour Thyroid, Wellbutrin XL\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Cortisol is secreted in circadian rhythm with a maximum 5-25ug/dL in the early morning (8:00 am) and minimum values of 3-16ug/dL in the late afternoon.   These results are low, but you need to do more tests.   A high plasma ACTH level with a low or normal cortisol level are diagnostic for primary adrenocortical insufficiency.   Diagnostic Testing for Addison's Disease - Serum cortisol at 8:00am , if the results are < 5ug/dL [SI:140nmol/L] (some authorities say < 3ug/dL [SI: 86nmol/L]) the disease is confirmed.  A result of > 20ug/dL [SI: 550nmol/L] excludes the diagnosis in an unstressed individual.   - Between these values a rapid ACTH stimulation test should be performed.  Low cortisol production in either the serum or the urine after ACTH stimulation is diagnostic of Addison's disease.   - A long ACTH stimulation test should be performed to differentiate primary from secondary insufficiency.    - Electrolyte profile:  Sodium, Potassium :(in primary Addison's)significantly know levels of sodium and a elevated levels of potassium.   It is not clear  how Armour Thyroid affects the results of the test since we do not know the level without the drug and we can not compare results from saliva with tat of blood analysis  Hope this information is useful. Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Female 42 years old with daily occurance of excessive dry mouth, extreme thirst, enlarged glands under tongue, sore tongue, sore throat, and hoarseness which started in Oct 2005.  Had 2 infected teeth removed with no avail to the mouth problem in Dec 2005.  In March 2005, did test positive for mono and took predinsone and antibotics for 10 days...again with no relief of mouth problems.  Seen ENT doctor in March 2005 who didn't look in my mouth or examine my mouth and stated it could be related to sjogren's syndrome.  He said there was no treatment and I would have to live with it.   Was diagnosed in April 2006 with uterus tumor and it was removed non-cancerous via hysterectomy.  Immediately after the surgery all mouth problems had vanished.  Mouth problems reoccured daily beginning in November 2006.  I have had Graves disease in 2005 which was fixed with 2 radiation pill treatments.  Have been taking synthroid .125 mcg/day.  Doctors have continuously tested my thyroid levels and sugar which are always good.  Family history includes colon cancer, diabetis, arthritis, high blood pressure, stroke, and hyperthyrodism.  Only other surgery was removal of my tonsils in 2005 due to an absess. My question is could this mouth problem be related to my thyroid or other glands?  What made this condition disappear immediately after my surgery?  Do you have any suggestion on what doctor I need to see?  Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  If I understand well , your problems started after the treatment with Radioactive Iodine.  Radioactive iodine treatment based on the fact that  the iodine collects in the thyroid gland, and the radioactivity kills the overactive thyroid cells.    After radioactive iodine treatment, any iodine not up taken by the thyroid gland is excreted in your urine and salivary gland.   Complications of Radioactive Iodine treatment include transient sore throat, neck stiffness and salivary gland affection leading to dry mouth. The salivary complications may be permanent and  results in constant dry mouth. Dry mouth in turn may predispose to recurrent sore throat.  Although thyroid cancer presents with hoarseness of voice, swallowing difficulties, your symptoms seems to be more related to treatment complications.  I advise you to follow with your doctor. Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am not an endocrinologist. However, I will try to help.  In the workup for cases with low testosterone, the first step is to check the LH and FSH.   If there is a testicular problem they should be elevated by negative feedback and the condition can be treated with testosterone replacement therapy.   If they are not elevated then this calls for checking the prolactin and TSH levels. If they are also reduced this could indicate a pituitary problem such as a tumor.  Which is why your PCP ordered the scan.  Conditions that can inhibit the anterior pituitary include hemochromatosis (ironoverload). Excess corticosteroids (Cushing's syndrome) as well as any exogenous steroid use (either estrogen or androgens), particularly in younger men. Anabolic steroid use can result in low testosterone and low LH and FSH.  Hope this helps.  Best regards,\n\n",

Very bad nutritional status.   Some hormonal such as cushing's syndrome and primary hyperaldosteronism can also lead to generalized salt and water retention.  These causes should be ruled out first as they are obviously of great concern.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "chronic tonsil pain-- brought on by simply talking!",
    "content": "I am a female adult in my mid-twenties, who has been experiencing chronic sore throats for the past 5-6 years. They began when I started a career as a director. I notice extreme pain in my right tonsil after I have been directing for just an hour or so. It gets worse the more I talk. I have to raise my voice to be heard, but I do not scream or yell-- the pain seems to come on very easily. I have also noticed the same problem occurs when I whisper or sing for just a few minutes. I have found that iced or hot tea is about the only thing that helps. Usually the pain is accompanied by a low fever and pain in my neck on the right side and it can last anywhere from a few hours to a few days. I feel certain that the area near my right tonsil is the source of the pain. When I press on it.. it stops for the moment. I am just not sure exactly what this is or what to do to make it stop for good! Any information would be greatly appreciated.     Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi am 25 and have been diagnosed with PCOS about a 1 1/2    years ago and was put on 1000 mgs of Metformin. I had no side affects until 4 months ago i started to get numbness and tingling in the hands and arms. I am a vegaterian and wasn't told to take a b vitamin with the metformin or that it could cause b 12 and folic acid deficiency. I went to 4 doctors trying to figure out where the numbness was coming from and all doctors took blood tests couldn't find anything wrong with me and told me to wait it out.   After being told by doctors that the worse case scenerio was that I had MS , I decided to go to a chinese doctor and acupunturist and she told me about the metformin and the B vitamin deficiency. She told me to take b vitamins and double the dose, there has been some improvement.   I guess my question is how long does it take to get your b vitamins back up. And with all the blood tests do they always check for b vitamin levels. They did say my red blood cells are mis shapened could that be b vitamin related. I just want to make sure i am getting the right treatment. I don't have insurance and i can't keep going to one doctor after the other with no results.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi greendaisy1116, There has been documented literature regarding long term Metformin use and a possible correlation to B12 deficiency. This would be compounded due to the fact that you are a vegetarian. B12 is a water soluble vitamin found in foods, ie., dairy products, meat, fish, shellfish, etc. This vitamin helps to maintain heathy red blood cells and deficiencies will cause \"mis shaped\" cells,  as well as causing numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. Standard labwork does not typically include evaluation of B12 levels and diagnostics are completed based on symptoms of a patient, ie., fatigue, muscle weakness, numbness, tingling, etc. A physician and pharmacist would be able to direct you on the recommended supplementation. A physician's evaluation with periodic labwork would also be recommended. There are many programs to assist people whom are uninsured/underinsured to have access to healthcare. Hospitals in most areas, also typically have programs to alleviate costs for diagnostic services etc. typically based on income and need.  Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Symptons are to much to handle",
    "content": "I am a 38 year old female.  The past 2 weeks have been almost unbearable for me.  I have been suffering from various symptons for the past 2 weeks.  It started off that I became very lightheaded and dizzy along with a feeling of panic.  I do suffer from panic attacks from time to time and have been prescribed xananx.  I am currently on 20mg of Lexapro.  I am also experiencing a tingling sensation in my arms and feet.  I can feel that I am very tense in my shoulder region.  I have hot flashes and feel foggy in my head (as though I am looking through smeary sunglass, but can see clearly) and am tired all the time, hungry but do not feel like eating, am cold mostly during the day hours and slight nausea throughout the day.  8 years ago I went off birthcontrol and in the middle of my first menstural cycle after going off birthcontrol, my body reacted in way put me out of commission for 6 weeks.  I had feelings of foggy head, tingling in the arms and legs, tired all the time, didn't want to swallow my food, aches in my legs as thought they were in vice and being twisted (only lasted for a few hours a day).  About 2 weeks into these symptons, I noticed a pain on my left side (ovary area) but did not pay much mind to it.  Then as the day passed I noticed that my symptons were slowly going away, I felt normal again, I was eating and everything was just as it was before.  I went to bed that night feeling like a new person.  When I awoke the next morning I noticed the feelings were coming back, but not as severe, but still to a point that I could not perform my daily chores.  I was out of work for 6 weeks.  I saw many doctors during this time including an endoc.  He ran a serious of tests and when I went back to meet with him for the results he said he had found nothing unusual.  He prescribed me zoloft and suggested I see a mental health professional.  Eventually after seeing more doctors and I gave into the mental health professional.  By the time I was seeing her I was able to function with the symptons only being mild.  She had told me in one of our discussions that she thought that my estrogen was low during my menstrual cycle and when I ovulated it was at it's highest.  That's why she felt the symptons went away during the time I had the pain on my side.  After my symptons cleared up the last 8 years have been fine up until 2 weeks ago. The only difference with this was it was not during my menstrual cycle but 14 days after my menstrual cycle started.  When I went to see my gyn recently he put me on Provera for 5 days because of issues with me not ovulating in the past.  The 2nd and 3rd day of taking the prescription I felt almost normal again, but by day 4 I started feeling icky again.  I called my gyn today to let him know I still wasn't feeling well and he suggested that I see a mental health professional...go figure!  I apologize for the length of this but there was just so much going on.  If there is anyone out there that can offer some advice I would greatly appreciate it.  I'm tired of feeling this way and would like to get some answers.  Thank you.\n\n",

The combination of drugs you are currenly taking may contribute to an elevated GGT, and statins in particular are known to cause elevated levels of liver function tests. You are currently taking a statin in the form of Simvastatin.  In the absence of liver and renal function tests, it is difficult to ascertain the actual cause of your elevated GGT, Albumin and BUN.

    "content": "Hi there - I am having the following issues - I am a 40 year old female with a family history of some heart disease (but, they all live to be really old so I come from good stock!!)  I started Synthroid a couple of years ago (went from 0.75 to 0.50 to 0.25).  However, I have noticed that when I am on it it really messes up my periods - they become longer - I used to get them every 21 days and would last for 5 days now they last for 10 days with spotting before and after.  Also, even when I was taking the Synthroid my weight kept going up.  In addition, I have heart palpitaitions (so, I lowered the dose of synthoid but, I still get them).  Because of the palpitations I cannot sleep at night.  Then I started using progesterone to help me sleep - but, I don't know if this is the right thing to do.  Also, I am having terrible fatigue.  I know that my adrenals are not in good shape and I think my estrogen is a bit low (Day 3 estradiol level came out to 18).  So, in short I am going to list all my symptoms below:  Constant Fatigue and pitch black circles around my eyes Palpitations - cannot sleep Constipation (but, better when I take the progesterone) weight gain periods not normal when on synthroid Low libido - all the time Depression when I stop synthroid Thyroid T4 came out to 2.2 last month (when I had stopped taking it for three weeks) however, my depression has started to come back so I've started taking it again as of a couple of days ago - and this time have included progesterone.  Estradiol on Day 3 is 18 Progesterone before my period is 12.45  I have been to the endo for my thyroid and he said everything is normal (i.e if my periods are getting messed up on the synt then that means something else is wrong not right).  So, I went to the gynecologist and they didn't know anything.  THen I went to a reproductive endo and he said everything is fine.  But, I feel just terrible - so if someone can help that would be GREATLY APPRECIATED.  Thanks!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Silver  Most of the symptoms you have described are related to your thyroid problem and consequently lack of sleep.  my understanding is that with the current synthroid dose you are taking, you are experiencing papitations, which in turn is causing you insomnia or in ability to sleep.  i believe it is very important to know your thyroid hormone levels, T4 and TSH which are indicative of how well your hypothyroidism is controlled. too much hormone will cause you papitations, insomnia and irregularities of periods.  did you doctor measure those markers?  now, it makes sense that when the dose is decreased (your thyroid med), you experience depression, since it is a a symptom of hypothyroidism.  I suggest overall to have your TSH and T4 levels measured and adjust the dose of synthroid based on these levels. once your thyroid condition is fixed, your sympoms of papitations, depression , and period irregularity should subside.  - be advised that sometimes, drug-drug interactions may occur and lead to some othe symptoms you are observing.  i wish you all the best, and take care.\n\n",

PCOS is actually a terrible name! cycts are just a symptom that some people may get, but the actual cause is insuline resistance. Metformin helps with the insulin part and eventually brings down your hormone levels. My doctor told me that I have PCOS without any tests, there are just very obvious symtoms I.E  hair growth, weight gain, no period , hormones out of wack..ect......  The metformin worked great with me. At first it was rough on my stomach, so I took half a pill at first. I have lost 70lbs in 4.5 months, with low carb and high B12 vitimins. Sugar and carbs seem to be our enemy since we are insuline resistant. good luck, I hope this helps\n\n",

My  periods started again and I have conceived 2 lovely children without any help.  I have been fine since then but 2 years ago started with severe anxiety and panic  attacks for no apparent reason which I am sure must be to do with some kind of imbalance  in my body. I am currently on Citalopram 20Mg.  I was put on Metformin years ago but then was told not to bother taking it, and have  never seen an enocrinologist. Please can you answer a few questions:)  Do you think I should be referred to an endocrinologist?  As far as I am aware PCOS is an endocrine disorder that stays in your body and cannot be  cured just minimised, is that right?  Anxiety problems are related to the hypothalamus which I understand to be part of the  endocrine system, so do you think my anxiety may be related to PCOS and endocrine system?  Do you think I should be on metformin and low carb diet etc?  I would appreciate any feedback as would finally like to think I know a little about  what may be going on in my body. Thank-You again.[/b]\n\n",

Family history includes mother who has hypothyroidism, grandmother just diagnosed with benign goiter on thyroid.  Currently on 875mg of Augmentin 2 times daily, magic mouthwash every 6 hours, and vicodin.  I am currently having trouble with pain low in neck/throat about 1/2 to 1 inch about clavicle.  This pain has been going on for about 10 days now.  It feels like someone hit me in the throat, and also feels very full or swollen, and occasionally feels like something is caught in throat.  The pain is constant, and is increasingly getting worse.  I was on Amoxicillin 14 days ago being treated for sore throat, or what I believed was a sore throat due to multiple sore throat infections in our house. Went to my PCP about 7 days ago because of the uncomfortableness, at that point he gave me magic mouthwash, and noted that my thyroid was more prominent that it usually is.  Thyroid and CBC tests all came back normal. Four days ago I was back at doctor and he gave augmentin to see if that will treat the problem.  But this pain is increasing still, as is the feeling of fullness/tightness in throat.  Can you please tell me what kind of diseases/illnesses can cause you to have an enlarged thyroid w/ pain, fullness,  but still have all normal thyroid tests??\n\n",

    "content": "I am 33, female, overweight, smoke, do not drink. In 1994 discovered a goitre, GP did a TFT and said it was normal.  I gained approx  56lbs in 3 months, was cold intolerant, always tired, depressed etc. in 1994 had a sub-total thyroidectomy as goitre was restricting my breathing and eating significantly.  All TFT's were normal (I was never informed of the actual level) and I began to feel better than I had in years and lost half the weight I'd gained.  In 1997 discovered I had a 2nd goitre. Again, TFT normal. 2.5.  Started putting on weight even though exercise was the same and food intake did not increase.    In 2002 things became worse.  This time I'm heat intolerant. Hands shake. One morning I awoke, opened my eyes and the room was diagonally spinning and I couldn't tell where I was because of it.  It lasted only a few minutes.  I arose and 2 mins later it happened again.  This time I was sitting erect.  Since then, I have developed facial hair in the form of growing a fine beard either side of the chin. My menses cycle ranges from 18 to 47 days, lasting between 1 to 7 days.  I have what I call vertigo (spinning, falling, about to spin sensation) I also get zig zags in my eyes, centre of vision gets blurred, these I suffer with on a daily basis. 3 times lost sight completely for 1-5 mins, 2 x black outs, memory problems, I have palpitations which occur upon waking.  Not panic attacks. I don't get headaches.  I have had a head MRI, which the opthamologist says is normal (I saw him because a doctor saw papilloedema).  An ECG-normal. last TFT was 1.1.  Unrelated but history anyway, in Jan had lapcholy and in June had acute pancreatitis, unknown cause.  I need help because my GP suggests it is all because I am overweight.  Somethings yes, but not all of it.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 24 year old female who was diagnosed with Grave's Disease when I was 16. I took PTU for 6 months, and was monitored for another 12 months and declared in remission. My symptoms have recently come back and my new doctor has informed me I should undergo radioactive iodine treatment.  I am sexually active, but with no plans to become pregnant anytime in the remotely near future. My doctor insists that I must take birth control pills if I want to undergo RAI treatment in case of accidental pregnancy.  I truly would prefer to not take birth control (I am very responsible about my use of condoms, and am pro-choice) but he insists that it is required before he will refer me to a radiologist.  Is he right, or should I find a new doctor who is more sensitive to my wishes?  My second question is: I am concerned with becoming hypo- after my treatment. Everything I have read cautions that it is likely to happen. Are there any treatments or options I could consider that could minimize this risk?  I have responded positively to PTU in the past (and my current condition has improved with PTU), so am worried that ablation and reversion to an underactive thyroid is extreme.  I know that it is unhealthy to continue to relapse every 8 years, but is there a possibility of a minimal dosage of RAI supplemented by PTU or another medication when necessary?  As you can tell, I am young and concerned about long term medication.  I would prefer to take as few pills as possible throughout my lifetime.  Thank you, Terra\n\n",

    "content": "Hi TerraL, My question for you, is your physician your primary care physician or an Endocrinologist? Grave's disease is generally treated with the use of radioactive iodine or antithyroid drugs in conjuction with beta blockers. To my knowledge, there isn't a specified amount of radioactive iodine to destroy a certain amount of the thyroid and thus can't be regulated. Of course you already know that this condition may be treated with antithyroid medications as it has in the past, how effectively with this course, I would be unqualified to specify. The concern of your current physician regarding pregnancy is due to the fact that there is a possibility of destruction of the fetus's thyroid due to the radioactive iodine. My suggestion to you is if you are not currently being evaluated by an Endocrinologist I would suggest that you do so to identify what options are best for you. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello darlintressa!  If you had Hypothyroidism diagnosed in 2001, when were you diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, and what was the treatment that you underwent?  Hypothyroidism is virtually the only disease that raises TSH levels in a sustained fashion. As the TSH level increases, an increase in T4 conversion to T3 occurs; thus, T3 levels are maintained. In early hypothyroidism, TSH is increased, T4 is normal to low, and T3 is normal.  Perhaps your doctor could be waiting for your forthcoming blood checkups to ascertain if the TSH levels are raised in a SUSTAINED fashion, which cannot be judged by a single reading of the blood levels, would you agree?  A second opinion never hurt anyone, and an endocrinologist definitely wouldn't.  Wish you a speedy recovery!  Bye  Bill\n\n",

    "content": "Dear darlintressa:  Was your total T4, or your free T4 (FT4) 1. 3? If your free T4 was 1. 3, you are most likely normal, but if your total T4 was 1. 3, you are definitely in the hypothyroid range. Since T3 is maintained normal long after T4 becomes low, I suspect that you are right, and that you probably have Hypothyroidism. (If the reference range you gave for T4 was the one the lab gave with the results, the test was for total T4.)  Your irregular menstrual periods and your large change (either up or down) are consistent with Hypothyroidism. You did not say what other symptoms you have, but a review of them should have been included in your evaluation, along with a targeted physical examination. Laboratory testing is only part of the evaluation, and TSH is only part of the laboratory testing. Non endocrinologists are taught to look at the TSH and to ignore everything else. As you noted, the official position of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association is that a TSH between 0. 3 and 3 is normal. Frankly, I find that in nearly all cases in which the TSH is above 2 (outside of non thyroidal illnesses), the patient is clinically hypothyroid and feels and functions better with higher thyroid hormone levels. In fact, I believe that most cases in which the TSH is consistently above 1. 5 can be proven to be clinically hypothyroid.  I am concerned that your TSH was not much higher, given your low thyroid hormone levels. This can be seen in non thyroidal illness, very low levels of the thyroid binding proteins, and a combination of thyroid gland failure (very common) with pituitary failure (uncommon).  I would not put much faith in the opinion of anyone who was still measuring total T4 or total T3, and I would have serious doubts about the understanding of anyone who would obtain any measure of T3 to evaluate possible Hypothyroidism (except as a last resort, by someone who had a sophisticated knowledge of the effects of non thyroidal illness on the metabolism of thyroid hormones, and such a person would definitely not be using measures of \"total\" thyroid hormones).  Since you were also treated for Hypothyroidism during pregancy, it seems unlikely that your laboratory abnormalities are due to temporary Hypothyroidism (such as \"post partum thyroiditis\" or \"subacute thyroiditis\") or to distortions from non thyroidal illnesses.  I am an endocrinologist with advanced certifications in thyroid and a Ph. D. in Physiology and Biophysics for my work pertaining to the thyroid. While it would be unreasonable to expect most other physicians to understand thyroid as well as I do, it is not unreasonable to expect them to go beyond what I call the \"cereal box version\" of such a common problem. Unfortunately, most physicians learned that TSH is the \"single best test\" of thyroid function, but missed the fact that TSH is lousey as a single test.  Yes, by all means, get a second opinion from someone who really knows thyroid. Endocrinologists are the experts in glands and hormones, including thyroid. You can locate an endocrinologist near you at www. aace. com  Let us know how how thngs turn out.  I hope that this has been helpful to you. _________________ M. Shank, M. D., Ph. D.

    "content": "Dear hollyhock:  I find it very difficult to believe that anyone woudl be \"in the range\" with a pea-sized thyroid gland, unless she were taking thyroid hormones or had abnormal production of thyroid hormones in other parts of the body.  The size alone of your thyroid gland would seem to exclude production of thyroid hormones by a thyroid cancer that had spread to other parts of the body.  Stuma ovarii is an extradinarily rare tumor of the ovaries that can produce thyroid hromones; it is so rare that few endocrine textbooks even mention it as a source of thyroid hormone production.  Because of the way the thryoid gland forms, it can be located anywhere from the chin to the bump on your breastbone (the sternal angle).  The technician who did your ultrasound probably did not even know that.  A technicium or radioactive iodine scan would answer the question quickly and definitively about how much thyroid tissue you have, and where you have it.  Kelp, of course, contains iodine, which the thyroid gland uses to produce thyroid hormnes, but I do not believe that a pea-sized thyroid is capable of producing enough thyroid hormones, no matter how active it is!  You say that your thyroid gland is actually inactive.  How was that determined?  Clearly, it cannot be very active, if it is a small as they tell you that it is.  In that case, it cannot be changing its activity very much over time, so regulating your thyroid hormone levels should be a cinch.  Since you say that your thyroid gland has been hard to control, I assume that you are taking thyroid hormone replacement therapy.  Unfortunately, non endocrinologists usually know little about the thyroid but that thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is \"the single best test of thyroid function.\"  Unfortunately, \"the single best test\" is a lousey single test.  A low normal level could mean that your thyroid hormone levels were normal or that your pituitary gland was not producing TSH (among a number of other possibilities that are not relevant to your case).  Without stimulation, the thyroid gland would shrivel up, and you would be \"in range\" for TSH, but still hypothyroid.  I have even seen cases where neither the pituitary nor the thyroid gland was working properly.  A good endocrinologist would never rely just on the TSH, as I suspect that you physicians have done, nor would he rely just on the laboratory results.  He would also do a physical examination to evaluate the effects of thyroid hormones in your body.    I am curious to know what you symptoms of hypothyroidism are. I use a standardized set of questions fort thyroid-related symptoms.  Dr. Bricker, an endocrinologist at Michigan State University in K'azoo, does not agree with me that symptoms are very helpful., because he says that they are not very specific for thyroid disease.  That's o.k., he is still a great guy (Actually, we agree that symptoms are not very specific, but not about how helpful they are.).   Go see Dr. Bricker and tell him that Dr. Shank from Lima, Ohio said he could get you off of that roller coster.\n\n",

    "content": "I am in the process of being dx'ed with a thyroid problem but for the time being I feel like I am choking on my thyroid.  It's uncomfortable, I sound like a 90 y/o woman that smoked 80 of those years.  I have to hold my head up so I look like I'm looking at the sky just to stop coughing and choking.  It feels like I swallowed something and it's stuck, but I know it's not.  Diagnostics confirmed it is thyroid.  I can't sleep because I feel like I can't breathe although I can, I can't swallow well, and most of all it is making me crazy.  Is there anything I can do for symptomatic relief until I see the surgeon?  I have an appt coming up soon but I think I'm going to lose my mind in the meantime.  A lot of this is my own fault because I put off doing anything about it for so long but now that I have myself in this mess, anyone have any suggestions?    I've already tried NSAIDs, ice packs, everything.  Nothing works.  Daily this thing pokes me in all new ways.  I'd scream if I could but I can't even do that.  Suggestions?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: I am afraid there are no home remedies for an enlarged thyroid other than what you are doing which is to position yourself in the most comfortable position so as to not feel you are choking.  Have you explained to the doctor about the coughing and feelings of choking?    Symptoms such as difficulty breathing, neck pain, change in voice, choking, or trouble swallowing should be investigate to determine whether an enlarged thyroid might be the cause of  these symptoms.  Potential problems to look out for include possible compression of local structures such as nerves, blood vessels and the trachea, and a risk of cancer.  Growth or enlargement of the thyroid may be due to a number of different conditions. The majority of patients with thyroid enlargement have benign thyroid disease  In rare instances, a very large thyroid gland (goiter) can cause compression of local structures in the neck, such as the airway (trachea). If this problem continues to worsen, patients may experience shortness of breath, which can develop quite rapidly if damage to the trachea causes collapse of the airway. Patients with large goiters may need to have their airway examined, through the use of imaging studies such as a chest X-Ray, or  MRI, or CT scan. If significant narrowing of the trachea is detected, treatment options include surgery, and less often, possibly radioactive iodine in patients who are not considered ideal surgical candidates. I don't know how long it has been since you saw the doctor or how long these feelings of choking have persisted, but if they become very troublesome I would suggest you go back to the doctor and explain to him the trouble with choking and breathing you are having.  I hope this helps. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "Dear NWATPA:  Your question was almost missed.  Please be sure to start your own topic, the next time you have a question.  The good news is that colloid cysts are harmless.  They do not require treatment, unless they become big enough to bother you (yours are a long way from that!).  They represent collections of colloid, the storage form of the thyroid hormones, and they come and go on their own.  If they do become large enough to be bothersome, they can usually be reduced in size by taking enough thyroid hormones that your thyroid gland does not need to make much of its own, but not so much that your body gets more than it needs.  Colloid cysts are more common in people whose thyroid glands are having difficulty making enough thyroid hormones and following injury to the thyroid gland (such as following a viral infection or after radioactive iodine therapy).  Most of the time, there is no obvious cause.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 25 years old (soon to be 26), and I have noticed a problem that seems to be getting worse as I get older.  My mother's side of the family seems to have thyroid problems, and I'm trying to figure out if I'm having the same problems.  Here's my symptoms in a nutshell: I am constantly tired no matter the amount of sleep I get, and it's hard for me to concentrate.  I seem to forget simple things during the day. I can fall asleep within 5 minutes of laying down- at any time of the day, even hours after I've had a full night of sleep. I am constantly bloated and constipated (embarassing), and I seem to be more bloated at the end of the day. I eat like a horse, but do not gain weight (despite having a child 3 years ago which is reported to change your metabolism).  I am 5'8\" tall, and weight approx. 130-138 on any given day - which is suppose to be a normal weight. I react very violently to high sugar content (for example, my job had a social lunch today in which they offered dessert - which I don't usually eat.  I ate 1/2 of a cookie, and I was visiting the bathroom not 25 minutes after I ate). I'm constantly sick, and when I get a cold (for example) it usually stays in my system for more than 4 weeks.  Almost like I have no immunity to anything.   And to top it all, I have absolutely no sex drive, which I use to when I was much younger (also very embarassing since I am married).  I feel like it's starting to affect my lifestyle, and I've been dealing w/ this for some time.  I don't know if it's really a problem, but it seems like I'm always struggling to get through the day.  I've researched the problem on the internet, but I don't know what it could be, and I don't think a simple visit to the doctor is going to give a concrete answer.  I work too much, and I'm a mother, but this behavior just seems uncommon to me.  Any advice in what the possibilities may be would be most appreicated.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear acurl2004:  I hope that you can still receive notice of my reply to your questions, which you posted a year and a half ago.  Even if not, I am sure that your questions resonnate with a lot of other readers of the Forum.  Falling asleep within five minutes is definitely abnormal.  It either indicates severe sleep deprivation or narcolepsy.  Never feeling refreshed no matter how much sleep you get shows that the quality of sleep that you are getting is very poor; this strongly points to a sleep disorder, such as narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, or periodic limb movement disorder of sleep.  You did not explain what you meant by your violent reactions to sugar and visiting the bathroom shortly after eating a cookie.  I can think of some things that might also help explain your bloating, but more details would be helpful.  Among the possiblilties are heritary fructiose intolerance, fructose-6-bisphosphatase deficiency, and carcinoid syndrome, but all of those are very rare.  You should certainly have your thyroid checked.  Actually, I would be very surprised if you did have any sex drive, the way you feel.  For women, everything else has to be just right (For men, it is more like, \"So I'm dead tired, and I hurt all over, and I feel awful--what's that got to do with it?\").  There are a lot of other things to be considered, but I would start with your sleep and checking your thyroid.  If you get to read this reply, I hope that you will let us know what those tests show.  I would be glad to offer some additional suggestions after these possibilities have been addressed.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear js2777:  Many of your symptoms can easily be explained by hyperventillation.   While commonly referred to as a \"panic attack,\" panic is merely one of the many possible symptoms.  In essence, you breath too deeply and too fast, and you blow off too much carbon dioxide from your blood.  That causes a lot of very unpleasant symptoms, including severe anxiety or panic, sense of impending doom, palpitations, chest pressure or pain (usually across the entire chest), numbness or tingling in the scalp, face (especially around the mouth), arms, fingers, and (occasionally) the legs and feet, lightheadedness, and dizziness.  To make matters worse, you feel as if you are sufficating, and you have probably been told to do things that only aggravate it (like:  \"Take deep breaths,\" or \"Blow into a paper bag.\")  The list of things that can cause hyperventillation is extremely long, but depression and anxiety (both of which you have) are the most common, by far.  Most people have at least one episode during their lives, but it is extremely disabling to those who have it frequently or who live in fear of experiencing it again, even if they fully understand that it is harmless.  The best treatment is prevention, but when that is not possible, trigger a reflex that shuts down your breathing!  When I was a graduate student in physiology, there were two reflexes which my professors confidently declared as absolutely useless and which I figured out uses for within twenty minutes that I still use in my clinical practice thirty years later.  One of them is the reflex that protects your lungs from being overfilled.  Since a person who has hyperventillated feels an overwhelming urge to breath, I encourage him to breath in as much as he can--until it hurts.  Then I instruct him to hold his breath.  Because of this reflex, he can do so very easily (If he were really sufficating, as he feels he is, he would still not be able to hold his breath.).  As he holds his breath, carbon dioxide levels start to build back up, and he begins to feel better.  When he can no longer hold his breath, I encourage him to let it out as slowly as he can and repeat the process.  Within two or three breaths, most people are feeling almost normal-which is a lot faster than a pill can work, and a whole lot faster than going to the emergency room!  The sensation of pressure in the back of your throat might also be related.  \"Globus\" (the sensation as if you had a ball in your throat) is more formally known as \"globus hystericus,\" which just assumes that anyone who has this sensation is just imagining it.  Common physical causes that I have seen include enlarge thyroid gland (goiter), large thyroid nodules or cysts, and brancheal cleft cysts.  The later are usually mistaken for thyroid nodules.  Radiologists (who have no business working up thyroids, in the first place) uniformly conclude that they are suspicious for thyroid cancers.  Brancheal cleft cysts are very interesting, because they are connections to the trachea found in about 15% of adults, can rapidly fill to very large sizes with secretions that can just as quickly discharge into the trachea as an extremely thick and tenacious fluid.  Anyone with a supraventricular tachycardia or recurrent hyperventillation syndrome should have his levels of TSH, free T4, and free T3 checked.  Of course, the thyroid should also be checked in anyone who is always tired.  The normal ranges for free T4 and free T3 vary with the lab (for free T4, it should usually be in the mid-to-upper portion of the lab's reference range; for free T3, it should usually be in the mid-to-lower portion of the lab's reference range).  According the the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association, the TSH should be between 0.3 and 3.0, regardless of what the laboratory's reference range is (Actually, I find that most individuals with TSH levels that are persistently 1.5 to 3.0 are also clinically hypothyroid and benefit from higher levels of thyroid hormones.).  The fatigue and yawning could be do to abnormal thyroid or a varieity of other endocrine problems, but I would be very concerned about a sleep disorder, such as narcolepsy or sleep apnea.  Unless there is an obvious cause that responds appropriately to treatment, chronic headaches deserve a work up.  Period.  Common causes include sinus and middle ear congestion or infections, migraines, obstructive sleep apnea and \"turtle\" headaches (from pulling your head under the covers when you sleep, like a turtle), and chronic use of pain medications.  Another cause is postconcussive headaches (often of the migraine type and often difficult to treat).  More serious causes include brain or pituitary tumors.  Irritable bowel syndrome is a diagnosis that I would make with a great deal of caution in someone who had twice had bowel obstruction.  Around here, IBS means nothign more than, \"We've already been paid for running tubes from both ends toward the middle, and we don't want to be bothered with figuring it out, when we could be making real money, instead of wasting our time on office visits and ordering tests that we can't bill for.\"  If these basics have been addressed and you still do not have a satisfactory answer, I would point out that my practice is also located in Ohio.\n\n",

    "title": "Odd question...thyroid and x-rays?",
    "content": "Hello, I'm a 44 year old female with degenerative issues in my lumbar spine and neck, and OA in both hips, have been told in the past I have fibromyalgia, and have had IBS for 30 years. I've been told that I had an immune deficiency when I was small (was frequently sick) and they gave me gammaglobulin (sp?) shots for it. As far as I know there is no family history of thyroid problems. I am currently taking lexapro for depression but otherwise only suppliments...multi vit., calcium, fish oil, glucosamine and condroitin, and Tylenol/Advil for pain.  Basically, from the array of symptoms I've been aquiring over the last year and everything I've been reading, I fit the bill pretty well for thyroid or possibly pituitary problems. Cold intolerence and cold hands and feet, exhausted constantly, tight throat and trouble swallowing, achy joints and muscles (mostly below the waist and upper back), weight loss, constipation, very moody, among a few other things.  This is going to sound like an odd question but...can having a large number of x-rays in a short period of time cause thyroid/pituitary problems...or aggrivate them if they already exist?   Between Jan '06 and Nov '06 I had 16 total x-rays of my hips, lower back, and neck as well as a full set of dental x-rays in Oct '06. I've read recently that radiation therapy (which I realize is much stronger than normal x-rays) can cause thyroid problems and (due to a family members experience) I know that large numbers of x-rays can cause cancer. My guess is that it's just coincidence but am curious for future reference. With all my joint issues I'm sure I have lots more x-rays in my future and, though I don't know for sure yet that I do have thyroid problems, if the connection is not totally unreasonable I can be sure to monitor the number of x-rays I get a little more closely...though I should have been doing that already and plan to from now on.  Thank you for offering this service and your time and energy and for any info you might have on the subject. Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear 4PtSake:  I agree with what Theresa said.  I would add that information about safe doses of radiation to the pituitary is hard to find.  The pituitary is considered to be radiation sensitive, but different pituitary cells respond differently (with the cells producing somatotropin=\"growth hormone\" being considered the most sensitive).  Conventional dosimetry, however, deals with the risk of a radiation-induced cancer, and cells that die from radiation obviously cannot develop into cancers.   I was not able to find specific information about the risk to the pituitary from repeated diagnostic radiation, but it is considered to be very low.  Unfortunately. during radiation treatments to the head or neck, little effort is made to protect the pituitary, since the dosimetry calculations are based upon the brain, which is fairly resistant to radiationn effects.  To make matters worse, patients never seem to be warned of the possible pituitary damage or to be taken seriously when they have symptoms or even confirmed pituitary insufficiency.  As compared to the pituitary, the thyroid is much less sensitive to radiation.  There is also more awareness of the risk of high cummulative occupational radiation exposure, and many who work around radiation sources routinely wear thyroid shields.  Even so, I have been frustrated by what appears to be a uniform lack of follow-up or even counseling about the risks to the thyroid in patients who have had therapeutic doses of radiation to the head and neck, and none of the patients whom I have seen have reported any effort to shield the thyroid during these procedures.  Unless you have had extradinary amounts of diagnostic radiation exposure, or you also have therapeutic or significant occupational or accidental exposure, the concensus would be that your risk for radiation-induced thyroid or pituitary abnormalities is very small.\n\n",

    "content": "Can someone read this and tell me if it says \"bovine pituitary gland extract causes an observable increase in adrenal androgen secretion\". I can't tell (I'm a programmer, not a medico).  [i]\"Evidence for existence of cortical androgen-stimulating hormone  LN Parker and WD Odell   An animal model using dexamethosone-suppressed, castrated dogs was developed to test the hypothesis that a pituitary hormone other than ACTH modulates adrenal androgen (AA) secretion. Plasma samples were obtained every 15 min during infusions of saline, synthetic alpha 1-24 corticotropin, porcine 1-39 corticotropin (ACTH), or bovine pituitary gland extract (PE) in a wide range of doses. Androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA), and cortisol (F) were quantified by radioimmunoassay. When the ratio of AA levels was related to those of F, in order to correct for ACTH content in the PE, the slopes of the dose-response curves for corticotropin and PE were different at the 0.01 level. For A the dose-response slope for the PE was 0.18 +/- 0.5 SE, whereas that of ACTH was 0.02 +/- 0.01. For the DHA response the slopes were 0.17 +/- 0.04 for the PE and 0.04 +/- 0.03 for ACTH. Related studies showed no increase in AA levels in response to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, bovine growth hormone (GH), bovine prolactin, ovine thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), or synthetic aqueous arginine vasopressin (AVP). We conclude that a pituitary factor other than ACTH, prolactin, GH, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, TSH, or AVP may be responsible for the observed increase in AA concentrations.

    "content": "Dear RobBlair:  Yes, it does.  Basically, all this abstract is trying to say is that there is something in an extract of the bovine pituitary gland that has a relatively greater effect to stimulate the adrenal glands to release adrogens (male-type sex hormones) as compared to cortisol (the main adrenal hormone), than either a synthetic ACTH or a porcine ACTH.  Furthermore, this stimulation cannot be duplicated by a variety of known pituitary hormones (What it should have said is that this stimulation cannot be duplicated by a variety of known pituitary hormones by themselves, since the authors apparently did not test them in combination with the other ACTH preparations.).  The authors conclude that there must be some unknown something else in the pituitary gland that stimulates the secretion of adrenal androgens (Considering the exhaustive work that has been done to isolate hormones from the pituitary gland, an even more plausible explanation is that there is something about the effects of bovine ACTH that is different from those of the other forms, but their explanation would certainly be a lot more exciting!).  My guess is that they are already working feverishly to identify a previously unknown pituitary hormone that stimulates adrenal androgen secretion more than ACTH does.  Since publishing this abstract is guaranteed to provoke a rush by big labs everywhere trying to duplicate their results and beat them to the possible identification of a new pituitary hormone, it would be a very safe bet that they are either (1) well along in their own search, (2) or that they are stuck and want to at least establish priority for this one small finding (and hopefully impress grant reviewers enough to get money to continue their search).  How does a computer programer get into such heavy basic science so far removed from his occupation?  By the way, in addition to being an endocrinlogist, I have a Ph.D. in Physiology and Biophysics for my own work on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid-peripheral tissues axis.\n\n",

    "content": "Gloria 38yrs, Female surgeries, gallbladder removed, regular child birth, miscarried 2, hypothyroidism, metabolic syndrome, raynauds, adult ADD, allergies, IC, interstim surgery, Chronic Fatigue, blurred vision, Mild Adrenal Hyperplasia  Greetings,         Here is a good one for anyone to try and figure out.   I have the following symptoms:  tinnitus (non-stop), Raynauds (everyday), body temp of 95 degrees (even though I take T3 and T4), hypothyroidism, metabolic syndrome, chronic fatigue, always cold makes my legs, arms and hands blotchy and elbows and knees blue, sleepiness to the point that I can\u2019t possibly stay awake, adult ADD (get so sleepy even after taking 30 mg of Adderall XR), loss of appetite, memory is terrible, (forget what I am doing most of the time)  problems staying asleep, (even if I don\u2019t nap during the day), problems with yeast, (take 150 mg of Diflucan once a week), no libido, problems reaching orgasm, allergies to yeast,grass,weed,birch, oak, dust, orange, lots of chemical sensitivities, dry skin, thin hair, poor nails, hair loss. anxieties, panic attacks (gone with the Adderall), faint pulse rate (even the nurses can\u2019t seem to get it. so they use a machine for this), painful cramps before periods, hair on chin, thin eyebrows (from the middle to the end nothing much left) hardly any eye lashes, almost no underarm hair. CT SCAN and diagnosis show one mildly large right side adrenal gland, left adrenal gland is of normal size, Mild Adrenal hyperplasia  Started 0.75 mg of Dexamethasone and my weight gain went from 150 lbs to 220 lbs during that time, even though I was taking T4 and T3 as well as Metformin.  I couldn\u2019t understand why I was gaining so much weight.  Yes my allergies went away but I was still tired and irritated.   A year later I saw my husband\u2019s doctor (he was having reactions to Synthroid) he ran new tests and said I did not have mild Adrenal hyperplasia.  I got down to 117 in about a year, when I stopped the Dexamethasone.  Now I have all those symptoms above and am trying to see if maybe having this hyperplasia could be the result of almost all of these things, low cortisol?   I have most all symptoms of Wilson\u2019s Syndrome.  Thanks, Gloria\n\n",

    "content": "Dear ggladbach (Gloria):  At the risk of offending you, I can categorically rule out \"Wilson's syndrome,\" because \"Wison's syndrome\" (not to be confused with Wilson's disease, or hepatolenticular degeneration) is purely fictional.  Since \"Wilson's syndrome\" does not exist, there are no symptoms of it for you to have.  O.K.  You are probably extremely skeptical about me, right now, after I just confirmed everything you have ever read in books and websites about how physicians do not recognize \"Wison's syndrome.\"   I hope, however, that the rest of my reply will ease your reservations about my competence.    The next easiest part of this reply is that adrenal hyperplasia should never be diagnosed from a CT, although a CT may suggest adrenal hyperplasia.  Adrenal hyperplasia may be conveniently classified as the classical (\"salt-wasting\") form that is almost always detected in childhood and the milder non-classical form that is associated with early puberty and athleticism in males (but short stature and impaired fertility) and excess hair, masculinization, hypersexualism, and impaired fertility in women.  Nearly all cases are due to a deficiency of an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase, and appropriate testing is based upon the levels or 17-hydroxyprogesterone before and after stimulation with cosyntropin.  Unless I am very suspicious of the condition, I just check a single 17-hydroxyprogesterone level.  If you doctor did the right tests, he will understand what all of that means!  I rather doubt that you have congenital adrenal hyperplasia, because the adrenal gland's attempts to make enough cortisol results in build up of the hormones in the steps before cortisol, and those high levels of those hormones also results in the production of high levels of male-type hormones (androgens).    There are a lot of things that can cause lack of libido and problems reaching orgasm, but the lack of underarm hair suggests that these actually may be because you do not have enough of the male-type hormones.  For women, sexual appetite and function are extremely sensitive to almost everything, so this might be just a nonspecific indication of the fact that you do not feel good.  Then again, it could point to an as-yet undiagnosed problem.  You mentioned that you have \"IC, interstim surgery.\"  I am not sure what that means.  Are you saying that you have interstitual cystitis?  That is apparently a form of neuropathy (abnormal nerve function) and generally responds to the same drugs used to treat other forms of neuropathy.  I would avoid the \"antidepressant\" class of drugs, however, unless you are depressed, because most of those will add to your sexual problems, and many may add to your weight.  Loss of the hair in the outer one-third of your eyebrows is a classic sign of hypothyroidism, and it is unlikely that a physician who did not recognize that fact would have a clue how to determine whether you do or do not have congenital adrenal hyperplasia, either.  Prescribing T3 plus T4 pretty conclusive proof that a physician does not understand thyroid physiology.   Always being cold is also suggestive of undertreatment of your hypothyroidism, but could also be a manifestation of your Raynaud's syndrome.  Some of your other symptoms probably are due to Raynaud's syndrome.  Raynaud's results in spasms in the blood vessels.  Rarely, it is associated with other diseases, such as some of the rheumatologic conditions.  It responds very well to low doses of a group of drugs known as dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and another group known as alpha-blockers.  If you cannot tolerate these drugs, nitroglycerin ointment works great, too, although it does have to be applied several times a day.  Fatigue is a common symptom of hypothyroidism, but can be due to a number of other things.  Interestingly, you describe yourself as having adult ADD, and then go on to describe profound sleepiness and non restorative sleep.  Since most cases of ADD are actually due to narcolepsy, other sleep disorders, or inadequate sleep, this may be a major clue.  Adderall and a variety of other drugs are effective for \"both\" narcolepsy and ADD (guess why!), but consideration needs to be given to abnormal sleep cycles (the other part of narcolepsy, best treated with sodium oxybate=Xyrem), sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome (best treated with cabergoline=Dostinex), and the like.    From your description, I suspect that you have significant problems with allergies, and these (plus your excessive weight in the past) could severely aggravate any tendency to obstructive sleep apnea.  You took a powerful glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, for a year.  Current recommendations are that you only take it if you are a woman and you are pregnant or attempting to become pregnant.  Since you took it for so long, yes, you probably developed some degree of adrenal insufficiency, and you may still need to take glucocorticoids when you have a major illness, major surgey, or other major trauma, even if you do not need them on a regular basis.  The facts that you have lost your appetite and lost below your initial weight makes me concerned that you do need to be taking a glucocorticoid on a daily basis, even if you did not have adrenal insufficiency before your dexamethaxone therapy.    It is not clear from your posting whether or noty you have experienced the yeast infections without taking dexamethasone, but dexamethasone can cause problems with fungal infections, including yeast.  People who suffer from malnutrition are also vulnerable to yeast infections, and you did say that you have lost your appetite and an enormous amount of weight.  You also did not say where your yeast infections occur (vagina? mouth? esophagus? in the skin folds?), but these infections may be clues to other problems, such as diabetes (common), hypoparathyroidism (uncommon), glucocorticoid excess (common from therapeutic use of glucocorticoids, very uncommon otherwise--and, by definition, excluding congenital adrenal insufficiency), and polyglandular autoimmune disease type I (generally seen in children).  Infertility, including recurrent miscarriages, may be due to a variety of things, but hypothyroidism is a common cause.  More than one interpretation of your descriptions of some of your symptoms, are possible, but dry skin, poor nails, hair loss. anxiety, faint or slow pulses, and menstrual clots or heavy menstural periods would also suggest abnormal thyroid hormone levels, especially hypothyroidism.  A word about thyroid testing.  I travel across the country, and I am yet to find a laboratory that has an acceptable range for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).  According to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association, the \"normal\" range should be 0.3 to 3.0.  Frankly, even in that range, I find that most people with a TSH that is persistantly above 2 are clinically hypothyroid and improve with higher thyroid hormone levels, and even 1.5 to 2.0 is suspicious of inadequate thyroid hormone levels, if persistent.  TSH is popularly known as \"the single best test\" of thyroid function, but it is a lousey single test.  I always check the free T4 (and sometimes other thyroid hormones, as well), and I also rely heavily on symptoms as assessed by standardized questions and on the physical examination.  If a thyroid expert, such as I am, cannot rely upon the TSH alone, neither can non specialists.  In case you are still skeptical of my competence to say that \"Wilson's syndrome\" is a myth, I will now tell you a little bit about myself.  I am an endocrinologist (and one of the few in the world who has also done a fellowship specifically in diabetes).   I am President, State Chapter Chair, and member of the Board of Directors of the Ohio Valley Chapter of the American Association of Clinical Encocrinologists (AACE), representing Ohio, Kentucky, and soon to officially represent Indiana, as well.  I have a Ph.D. in Physiology and Biophysics for original work on the hypopthalamic-pituitary- thyroid-peripheral tissues axis.  I have advanced certifications in thyroid diagnosis and treatment.  By separate email, I am sending you copies of the standardized questionnaire that I developed for diagnosing and following my thyroid patients and another questionnaire that I developed for screening for a variety of sleep problems.  I suggest that you complete them and take them to your physician.  Of course, I also strongly suggest that you find an endocrinologist (http://www.aace.com) in your area.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear ggladbach (Gloria):   I forgot to mention that the most common cause of tinnitus is fluid in the ears, usually as the result of allergies (from which you suffer), an upper respiratory infection, or abnormal functioning of the Eustachean tube that connects between the middle ears and the back of the nose.  Sometimes, the fluid in the ears or in the sinuses (which are not directly connected to the middle ears, but also drain into the back of the nose) becomes infected, and this infection can become chronic.  Chronic infection could also make you feel awful.  Adults seldom get earaches, and any pain they do have is usually perceived in front of the ear or under the jaw.  For reasons that are beyond me, these causes are seldom considered and even less frequently recognized, even by \"Ear, Nose, and Throat\" specialists.  Another fairly common cause is damage to the nerve fibers in the middle ear, often as the result of previous infection or of exposure to loud noise.  A rare, but important cause, is a growth on the cranial nerve that supplies the ears, known as an acoustic neuroma (because it is a tumor on the acoustic nerve).  I hope this helps you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there, I am a 19 year old female in good health, never sick...For about a year and a half now I have had a lump on the left side of my neck that has increased slightly and slowly over time. I went to a Otolaryngology (ENT) about 6 months ago who sepecialises in head and neck surgeries, and we had a ct-scan done, and everything came back normal prior to the cat scan i had two different antibiodicts with no change to the lump,and past blood tests looked normal i believe they were taken a little bit longer back....He recognized that their was something there but because nothing showed up in the ct-scan we postponed the possible needle aspiration...I am curious about other symptoms i have though and if they could be related to the lump in my neck...I have this thing where Say i eat, then sometimes as early as two hours after i eat, i get really nauseas and have to eat right away, usually its about 3-4 hours after i eat. I also get more headaches and neckpain..I am wondering if it is worth going in to get the needle aspiration as that would be my next step because I still find it strange this lump in my neck....Thank you so much for any advice...\n\n",

I went the beginning of winter for a cold, as i usually get one a year then Im fine until next year. At the office my doctor check me out and drew blood. he prescribed antibiotics and sent me on my way. 3 days later i was fine and when i went back 7 days later for a followup he mentioned i had low thyroid levels and put me on levothyroxin ( spelling?)   Now heres the problem..  I been on this for about 5 months now and I HAVE NOT felt the same since.. I spoke with my doctor about it and he insists I need this med. I have NO symptons that low thyroid has, none, only that my levels are low. Im not sure the name but he ran many of test all came back my tyroid is not producing enough..  I keep telling him I do not feel right and have not felt right since i been on this medicine.. but always insists i need the medication to correct it.  If I have NO symptons and feel great otherwise, why do i need this just cause my numbers are not normal.. maybe my body don't need or operate as the doctors say normal range.. I recently tookit upon myself to stop taking the tyroid med and guess what, I feel like my old self.   So I am confused now, my doctor wont listen to me how i feel but only goes by numbers of the norm.. HELP Please...\n\n",

I am currently taking birth control pills, synthroid 300 MCG's, 500 mg glucophase, Cymbalta, a muscle relaxer and a pill for joint pain.  My family doctor has ran tests for everything and they have found nothing but carpal tunnel however, the surgery did not help much.  Do I need to see a endocrinologist?  And is there any connection to all of my medical problems and pain?  Please help with guidance.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear tinydancer   There seem to be a connection between your symptoms. First, your depression issue, could be related to your over-weight, diabetes, and hypothyroid state. Even though you are taking thyroid supplements, it could be that your synthroid dose is not sufficient, though the dose you  mentioned seemed relatively high. So how soon did your doctor check your thyroid test after he put you on this synthroid dose?  Second the pain you are having could be due to neuropathy which can be caused bt diabetes. It is one of the very common complications of diabetes seen in patients.   How well is your diabetes controlled, this is a main key in your case. Is your glucophage controlling your blood sugar?  I recoomend that you see an endocrinologist, and address your thyroid and diabetes issues. The pain you have could be controlled if your diabetes is controlled, and the depression could be reveresed or lessened with the control of your thyroid dysfunction.  thank you very much, and i hope you feel better soon. Let me know if you have additional questions.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I am 25 years old, and I was diagnosed hypothyroid in 2000 at the age of 20. A cause for the hypothyroidism was never identified and I have no known family history of thyroid disorders so this came as a surprise. My family has tossed around various theories, including the fact that I was subject to a few deep-skull x-rays as a child (in which it was uncertain if the administraors put the x-ray shield completely over my throat), whether it was caused by various antidepressants I have taken, by stress or just the result of some unknown family link.   Recently I was talking to a nurse friend who recommended that i have a thyroid scan done to be safe and make sure it wasn't cancer that caused the hypothyroidism. I hadnt thought of that since none of the endocrinologists I had seen around the time of diagnosis recommended it and they seemed unconcerned about the cause. I have had my thyroid palpated by several general practitioners and an ENT over the last year, but no nodules or lumps were detected. I am fairly unconcerned about the possibility of cancer since it has now been 5 years and nothing has indicated the presence of anything like that, but I am just curious about 3 things: 1) could deep-skull x-rays ever cause hypothyroidism? 2) how typical is it for thyroid scans to be performed in the absence of a palpable lump/nodule? and, 3) SHOULD i be taking this more serious and actually request a scan be done?  Many thanks for your time and advice!!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm not expert but have had thyroid cancer.  I did have a palpable lump and so I had a scan.  The scan just confirmed it.  A scan with not tell you if you have thyroid cancer, only if there are nodules and if the nodules function or don't function.  There can be no reason why a thyroid gland fails.  But the biggest reason, I think, is Hashimoto's thyroiditis.  This is an autoimmune disorder where the body attacks the thyroid gland and slowly damages the gland.  I believe a blood test can detect it.  As long as you don't have any palpable nodules, I would not worry.  Lots of people get hypothyroidism and it's not really important why, just that it should be treated.  Oh, and yes, X-rays can cause some damage but these were the type of X-rays done in the 40s through the 60s for acne treatment.  They are no longer done and, as far as I know, a few x-rays cannot cause this. Christine\n\n",

    "content": "I have been going to my Family Dr. for years.  In the last 7 years, I have had alot of issues that we can't resolve and my dr. has just gone with different meds to counteract symptoms instead of finding out what is going on for sure.  I was not sure what specialty to list my issues under, they fall under all of them. My Dr sent me to a pyhchiatrist counselor, and her summary was, it is not a mental issue, you have a physical issue somewhere, try a endochrinologist.  Because of my insurance and being a single Mother, that hasn't been possible.  Her thoughts was, I have some depression, but because of not knowing what was physically wrong with me.  Ok here we go with my ailments; achey joints, no sexual desire or achievement of a orgasm, thoughts blocked and hard to communicate, sometimes words slur, normal periods, foggy thoughts, very tired all the time, and no motivation to do things through out the day, everything is forced just to do what I have to get done. My day of getting things done doesnt start til the late afternoon, when the day is almost over. I get angry over simple things and have trouble not snapping or handling situations better like I used to. I sweat all the time, and have excess facial hair and acne. I get infections and virus's often. My feet and hands swell alot. At bedtime my mind is in full swing with thoughts of how to handle the next day or a situation and creates insomnia and sometime anxiety attacks and dizziness. I have on and off vaginal discharge, but even with the discharg not there, I have a consistent odor, usually more of a urine odor and consistent sweating there too.  I have very sensitive skin. I am a 35 yr old female. My Dr thought maybe PPMD. When I was pregnant 6 years ago, i didnt produce enough progesterone.  About 4 years ago my family dr, after listening to my ordeals for about 2 months asked me, if I knew anything about my progesterone level and I told him yes, when I was preg, I didnt produce enough. So he started me on a progesterone natural cream.  I t helped but wasnt enough, so he started my on Zoloft with the cream.  Thaht helped but wasnt enough, so he added Wellbutrin Xl to the concoction. Now I am on the WomentoWomen hormonal balace treatments(vitamins) and cream, Zoloft 100 mg. and Dexadrine 15 mg.  Something is wrong for me to have to take uppers to get through every day.  I have had all the basic blood test, and they were all normal.  Plwase help with economical suggestions.   Marystime\n\n",

I just found out, after feeling like hell for 5 years, that I have a suspicious nodule on my thyroid. I would not stop until I found out what's wrong. I never had any medical problems in my life, except 18 years of kidney stones (which I have hyperparathyroidism) You also need to see a rheumatologist to also help with your symptoms and an endocrinologist.\n\n",

I ended up at the accessment intake for a mental hospital.  They listened but would not admit me because I am not suicidal.  They again sent me to a counselor and phychiatrist.  I have been to the counselor and before I could even sit down, she asked me if I have been to a Endochrinologist, because of my appearance(broad shoulders, not destinct hips(oh lord more sysmptoms, I just accepted as family traits) and the facial hair.  I was really impressed, her intune abilility to see this so quickly.  Well to make things short, I am awaiting a appt with a Endochrinologist, in the end it looks like I am hormonally screwed up, through my genes.  I will let you know what I find out.  Looking up this info (so many things have happened to my sisters and mom that may be connected with this issue!)  I was to my ends wit last week.  I have lost my job and cant deal with every day issues.  Hopefully this will answer my ailments in one. Mary\n\n",

He couldn't find anything wrong with me and said I should seek professional help...which I eventually did and low and behold she told me that it seemed to be my estrogen.  Anyway, suffered for months with the systems and they went away, but not completely, always felt that I was in a fog.  2 weeks ago, I started, sweating, shaking, panic set in and I just felt as though something was not right with my body again.  I have been to my family doctor and my gyn.  My family doctor switched my medication from Paxil to Lexapro and the gyn, he precribed my Provera for 5 days (in 12/04 he discovered through tests that I was not ovulating and thought that my system was out of wack).  I felt better on day 3 and on days 4 and 5, the symptons started returning.  Called the gyn today and he suggested antidepressents and xananx...Hello already on it and then came the words which I dreaded...\"mental health professional\"...been there done that.

    "content": "Dear Popescu:  Your free T4 (FT4) is fairly low and suspicious for hypothyroidism, but your thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is normal.  In other words, the main thyroid hormone level is low enough that the pituitary hormone controlling the thyroid would be expected to be higher.  This is often seen in non thyroidal illness, but there are complicated combinations of other problems that could cause that pattern, as well.  For your age, your total testosterone is relatively low, but the pituitary hormones that control testosterone production (LH an FSH) are not elevated.  This most likely means that the proteins that carry testosterone in the blood are low, so that more of the testosterone is \"free\" or readily available to have an effect.  Again, more complicated explanations are possible, however.  Estradiol is high for a man.  This can be seen with advanced liver disease, but is more commonly seen in men who are very much overweight.  In the first case, the liver can not bread down normal amounts of estrogen that are formed, and in the second, the fat cells convert too much testosterone to estrogen.  Your prolactin level is relatively high.  However, it is within the range that it could be normal or abnormal.  I would recommend that it be repeated.  Often, pain or anxiety with blood draws will raise it that high, in which case the levels may be much lower when repeatedd.  On the other hand, sometimes the pituitary gland produces too much prolactin, which can interfere with sexual functioning in men (cause menstrual irregularity and infertility in women) and lower testosterone levels.  If your prolactin is consistently that high, it should be treated by an endocrinologist.  Your calcium may be low, but that depends upon the level of albumin in the blood that carries most of the calcium.  If your albumin is low, then the total calcium will probably be low, even if the calcium that is readily available (\"ionized calcium\") is normal.  The low \"Fe\" iron suggests iron deficiency, but that needs to be confirmed by additional testing.  It would be helpful to know more about you--especially what problems you were having that led to these tests being done.\n\n",

    "content": "First, I would like to thank you for your kindness and for your time.   Regarding testosterorone level, I\u2019m not overweight (183 cm \u2013 75 kg) so I should understand that the low level might be generated by a liver disease or the high level of prolactin. About a year and a half I\u2019ve started to have some sexual problems. For a period of time my libido was very low and it was verry difficult to obtain an erection and to maintain it long enough. However, if this would happen then would interfeare precoce ejaculation and no more sexual disire. Those problems apeared suddenly after a period of time in wich I felt very healthy and everything was normal. I thought that I had to deal with a saturation, because of excesses I\u2019ve made (for 3 months I had sex with my girlfriend at least once a day). Lately my libido has grown (still not normal, I think), but I still have precoce ejaculation. This problems, the fact that I\u2019m not very phisical mature at my age (my facial hair is kind of sporadic(it\u2019s present only on the chin) - and I need to shave at 6-7 days, also the chest hair is sporadic) and I\u2019ve reached puberty at    16-17,  led me to an endocrinologist and to these tests being done. My doctor has seen the results of these tests but said that it is hard to find out the causes that led to them. I would appreciate if you would recomand me what more tests should I do, what other investigations. Thank you very much\n\n",

If you were my patient, I would perform a \"free testosterone\" and a \"free T3,\" and repeat the \"free T4\" and prolactin.  If it appears that you really do have a testosterone deficiency, I would do iron studies to exclude hemachromatosis, which can affect the testes directly and other endocrine glands, including the pituitary.  If you have a confirmed pituitary abnormality, I would screen for other pituitary abnormalities and consider an MRI of the pituitary with dynamic imaging.  Depending upon what your physical examination shows, consideration might also need to be given to genetic testing, but I do not routinely do that.\n\n",

I feel tired, downright exhausted all the time.  I have trouble sleeping at least 50% of the time.  I have Migraines frequently, but even when I don't have a full blown Migraine I have a head ache most of the time.  My skin is extremely dry.  My nails are brittle.  I have always suffered from chronic constipation.   I have had the typical Thyroid tests (blood test), but it always comes back within normal range.   This being hot all the time is terrible to live with.  If I do any kind of exercise or strenuous work I get so hot that I can barely stand it and my face gets bright red.  Even after a cool or cold shower, it takes hours for me to cool down to normal, which is still hot for me.  I always get a Migraine any time I do anything strenuos and the hotter I get the worse my Migraine becomes.  I am at my wits end as to what to do.  Any further tests that should be done?  My Dr. is very easy to talk to and I know would be willing to do whatever is needed.  I do not have medical insurance, so need to try to keep the tests down to the least expense possible.  Would appreciate anyone's suggestions and input. Thank you so much Judith Watson\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 57 year old female.  At the age of 27 I had my last child, and through most of the pregnancy I felt hot most of the time.   My son was born in August, and that August, was one of the hottest on record at that time.   I had a C section.   Since then I haven't been able to tolerate the heat.   Now for the past few years, whenever I try to do anything I get extremely hot.  Just standing and folding laundry makes me hot.  I get hot just walking to the mailbox.  No matter what I'm doing, I have to stop or sit down and wait  to cool off.  Luckily when going through menopause in my early 40's, I never had one hot flash.   This past summer I stayed in the house most of the time with the AC on.  It was just to hot for me outside.  I have been on blood pressure medication since I was 20 years old.  I'm currently taking Cozzar and Atenanol, Allegra, protonox for heart burn, and cellabrex when needed.  Past surgeries include 2 C sections and gall bladder when I was in my 20's.  My husband thinks if I lost weight I wouldn't be so hot, but I have lost weight before and still got hot when doing normal activities.  I would love to walk for my health but I don't  because I get unbearably hot.  While everyone else is anxiously waiting for summer I'm dreading it's coming because I know I'll be in the house with the AC on.  Getting hot like this is preventing me from fully cleaning my house and donig any other normal activities.\n\n",

Low body temperature can be related to any number of different problems. Sometimes low body temperature and all the symptoms that go along with it can be help with simply a body cleanse and a change your diet and exercise program.

    "content": "Dear rrtbear:  I just responded to utleezard's question.  Although that response is partially applicable to you, I would like to point out a very important difference:  You are having chills and sweats.  While there are a number of possible interpretations of your symptoms, the most straightforward is that you have either an infection or a rheumatologic condition.  In my experience, the most common location of a hidden infection is the ears and sinuses.  In men, chronic infections/inflammation of the prostate is often responsible.  In women, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease may be the cause.  People with kidney stones may have a chronic urinary tract infection that is very difficult to diagnose or treat.  A relatively common cause is \"cat-scratch fever,\" usually acquired (surprise!) from a cat scratch.  I have seen cases of similalr symptoms caused by long-standing lung and other abcesses .  Tuberculosis and related diseases are not uncommon.  Certain viral infections of the liver (especially chronic hepatitis B and C) are possible causes.  If you have been in a part of the world where malaria is common, that should be considered.  Cellulitis should be obvious, but it is usually overlooked and usually misdiagnosed when seen.  Fungal infections are unlikely causes, but they can be difficult to recognize.   I have less knowledge about the rheumatologic conditions, but I would mention lupus erythematosis, Goodpasteurs' disease, midline granulomatous disease, Wagner's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, the various conditions causing inflammation (vasculitis) of the blood vessels, and even garden-variety rheumatoid arthritis.  From the endocrine perspective, flushing and sweating (\"hot flashes\") followed by chills as the sweat evaporates are common with deficiencies of the sex hormones (Think of a woman going through menopause.)  They are also seen with an excess of thyroid hormones.  I do not get the feeling that you are describing an endocrine disorder, however.  Is there a connection between your symptoms and the family history of thyroid disese?  Perhaps.  Most cases of thyroid disease are autoimmune, meaning that the body's own immune system attacks it.  Autoimmune diseases tend to run in families, but not necessarily the same autoimmune disease in various family members.  Likewise, the rheumatologic diseases are autoimmune disorders.  You did not mention how you determined your body temperature.  You probably know that this should be measured under the tongue with the mouth closed, but you may not know that it should be measured in the very sensitive pocket at the back of the tongue.  Unfortunately, if it does not hurt, it's not the right place.  I hope that this is helpful to you and to utleezard.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear pecandelight:  Very few pituitary tumors cause Cushing's.  The vast majority of pituitary tumors produce an excess of prolactin.  Prolactin-secreting tumors should treated medically.  Period.  They should never be removed surgically, no matter what their size, because they shrink so dramatically with medical therapy.  A much smaller group of tumors produce an excess of somatotropin, which is better known in children as \"growth hormone.\"  The official \"standard of care\" for these tumors is surgery, regardless of the size, but every practicing endocrinologist that I know rejects these guidelines.  Most of these tumors can be controlled in size and secretions with medications.  (The effects of somatotropin can be blocked without affecting anything else, but this does not prevent the tumor from possibly slowly growing over time, so it is not very good as the only treatment of a tumor as large as yours.).  An even smaller group of tumors produce an excess of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce too much cortisol.  When caused by a pituitary tumor, this excess is commonly known as \"Cushing's disease.\"  It is difficult to treat these tumors medically, and they should generally be surgically removed, although medical treatment of the tumor and to block the excess production of cortisol from the adrenals can be tried.  An extremely rare group of tumors produce thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) or leuteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).  If you have one of these, you should go to a major pituitary center, because so little is known about them.  Another very small group of tumors produces a mere fragment of a pituitary hormone, known as alpha-subunit, and yet another very small group produces nothing that we can measure, at all.  Most of these do not respond to medical therapy, but surgery is still not appropriate, unless they cause problems because of their size (unlikely at 9 mm).  Since a tumor that does not produce prolactin can interfere with the brain's ability to keep prolactin secretion by the rest of the pituitary low, prolactin levels may be high in tumors that do not secrete it.  A few tumors produce both prolactin and somatotropin.  Headaches are common with pituitary tumors and have been found to correlate with the levels of prolactin in the fluid around the pituitary gland (although no one is sure why), but not the prolactin levels in the blood.  The fact that you are not having any symptoms makes Cushing's disease extremely unlikely.  If you truely do not have any symptoms, then an excess of somatotropin is also unlikely.  Some people with prolacin-secreting tumors do not have symptoms, but most men and pre-menopausal women do.  You say that your surgeon is \"gung ho\" to operate.  There is no kind way of saying what I need to say about that, so I will be blunt:  The only reason he is \"gung ho\" is because he gets so few opportunities to operate on pituitary tumors.  If he were an expert pituitary surgeon, he would be working very closely with your endocrinologist and avoiding surgery.  Keep your endocrinologist and dump that surgeon--if you ever do need pituitary surgery, you will want your endocrinologist to refer you to someone else to do it, anyway!  Endocrinologists are experts in glands and hormones.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear darlintressa:  Was your total T4, or your free T4 (FT4) 1.3?  If your free T4 was 1.3, you are most likely normal, but if your total T4 was 1.3, you are definitely in the hypothyroid range.  Since T3 is maintained normal long after T4 becomes low, I suspect that you are right, and that you probably have hypothyroidism.  (If the reference range you gave for T4 was the one the lab gave with the results, the test was for total T4.)  Your irregular menstrual periods and your large change (either up or down) are consistent with hypothyroidism.  You did not say what other symptoms you have, but a review of them should have been included in your evaluation, along with a targeted physical examination.  Laboratory testing is only part of the evaluation, and TSH is only part of the laboratory testing.  Non endocrinologists are taught to look at the TSH and to ignore everything else.  As you noted, the official position of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association is that a TSH between 0.3 and 3 is normal.  Frankly, I find that in nearly all cases in which the TSH is above 2 (outside of non thyroidal illnesses), the patient is clinically hypothyroid and feels and functions better with higher thyroid hormone levels.  In fact, I believe that most cases in which the TSH is consistently above 1.5 can be proven to be clinically hypothyroid.  I am concerned that your TSH was not much higher, given your low thyroid hormone levels.  This can be seen in non thyroidal illness, very low levels of the thyroid binding proteins, and a combination of thyroid gland failure (very common) with pituitary failure (uncommon).  I would not put much faith in the opinion of anyone who was still measuring total T4 or total T3, and I would have serious doubts about the understanding of anyone who would obtain any measure of T3 to evaluate possible HYPOthyroidism (except as a last resort, by someone who had a  sophisticated knowledge of the effects of non thyroidal illness on the metabolism of thyroid hormones, and such a person would definitely not be using measures of \"total\" thyroid hormones).  Since you were also treated for hypothyroidism during pregancy, it seems unlikely that your laboratory abnormalities are due to temporary hypothyroidism (such as \"post partum thyroiditis\" or \"subacute thyroiditis\") or to distortions from non thyroidal illnesses.    I am an endocrinologist with advanced certifications in thyroid and a Ph.D. in Physiology and Biophysics for my work pertaining to the thyroid.  While it would be unreasonable to expect most other physicians to understand thyroid as well as I do, it is not unreasonable to expect them to go beyond what I call the \"cereal box version\" of such a common problem.  Unfortunately, most physicians learned that TSH is the \"single best test\" of thyroid function, but missed the fact that TSH is lousey as a single test.  Yes, by all means, get a second opinion from someone who really knows thyroid.  Endocrinologists are the experts in glands and hormones, including thyroid.  You can locate an endocrinologist near you at http://www.aace.com  Let us know how how thngs turn out.  I hope that this has been helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "This is my first post on this website; I'm hoping to find some guidance into the next steps to figure out whats wrong with me. I'm 23 years old, and recently got out of the military less than a year ago. For the most part I'm suppose to be in good health but I\"m not. Gradually over the past year I've experienced severe pain in my joints and bones, to include my hips and lower back, my legs, arms, and hands. Sometimes I lose strength in hands, almost like arthritis. But that's not all. I also get extreme flushing on my neck and face for no reason. I'm tired, depressed, sick to my stomach and my body hurts. Mine you, all this just started happening in a year span. I work out religiously; I used to run 5 miles a day and now I can't even jog. I also lift weights but I now I have to stop that because of the pain.    I have been to several doctors and I can't get an answer for this. I've been checked for different types of arthritis and all came back normal. I've been on different medications to stop the pain and nothing has fixed it. I've taken anti-histamine for the flushing and it didn't even slow it up. I'm not sure what to do at this point. Can it me an immune disorder of some type. What about low testostirone?  If anyone has any suggestions please let me know. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Dear BRN:  As you suggested, testosterone deficiency can cause flushing.  It certainly can cause weakness, and it rarely causes neuropathy (a type of nerve damage), but it would not explain your nausea.  Furthermore, the flushing is usaully over the entire body, although it can be confined to the face and neck.  There is a rare type of neuropathy that causes flushing above a level on the chest that varies between individuals and tends to raise over time.  Usually, the flushing occurs after eating.  However, this is almost exclusively seen in people who have had very poorly controlled diabetes for many years, and that hardly seems probable for someone who was discharged from the military less than a year ago.  Carcinoid syndrome is a collection of symptoms and physical findings that often include flushing.  This is caused by a rare tumor that is usually too small to be seen on imaging studies, but which can make tremendous quantities of any of a large variety of hormones and other powerful chemicals.  Most of them are benign.  They are most commonly recognized in the intestines or colon, but they may occur in the lungs, stomach, pancreas, and even odd places like the urinary bladder.  Usually, but not always, the hormones and other substances that they produce in excess can be identified by careful testing.  Often, the testing needs to be done more than once, because the secretions of the tumors can change through the day and from day-to-day.  Even without the lab tests, however, a dramatic worsening of symptoms after some trigger (such as eating, urinating, breathng cold air) may be a valuable clue to the presence and location of the tumor.  One of the classic products of carcinoid tumors is serotonin, which can cause flushing, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, among other symptoms.  Another common product is histamine, which can cause similar symptoms, plus itching or shortness of breath; I have a patient whose carcinoid tumor seemed to produce (until recently) only histamine, and he has only gotten relief with extremely high doses of octreotide (a synthetic version of a hormone that usually reduces the size and activity of carcinoid tumors), classic antihistamines, and the H2-blockers (antihistamines that are used to block production of stomach acid).  A word of caution:  Don't let anyone tell you, \"If you do have carcinoid, it's malignant and metastatic to the liver, anyway.\"  A little knowledge is an awful lot of ignorance!  And if do have carcinoid (unlikely, but worth considering), make sure an endocrinologist, NOT an oncologist, treats you for it.  I have also seen a patient with symptoms very similar to yours who was told first by another endocrinologist and then by me that he needed tests for possible carcinoid tumor.  The fact that his symptoms usually occurred about 1/2-1 hour after eating added to the clinical impression that he might have carcinolid syndrome, most likely from a carcinoid tumor in his small intestines or colon.  However, nothing showed up on repeated testing, and I was not able to identify another cause.  I am still not sure why he went to a large depression clinic, since he not think that he was depressed, and screening questions did not suggest depression, but he went.  They told him that they did not believe he was depressed, but gave him extensive tests for depression, anyway.  To everyone's surprise, the test results indicated severe depression.  To my surprise, treating him with antidepressants has given him the first two weeks without disabling symptoms in three years.  Since the medications that he was given would be expected to severely worsen symptoms from the most common forms of carcinoid syndrome (another reason that I had not tried them!), it now seems pretty unlikely that he has a carcinoid tumor.  I do not know of any other cases like this, but it does raise the possiblity that treating your depression (AFTER screening for carcinoid syndrome) might even help your other symptoms.  Flushing can also be manifestation of infections.  I have seen chronic sinus infections, chronic prostatitis, and chronic urinary tract infections (usually associated with kidney stones that did not pass) that were missed for years by other physicians.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of things that can cause nausea, including neuropathy, adrenal insufficiency, intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes, ulcers, blockage (including severe constipation), and common parasitic conditions (such as Giardia lamblia).  Of these, the only one that is likely to cause body aches is adrenal insufficiency, but that is more likely to cause abdominal pain.  Fatigue is another symptom that has a lot of different possibe causes, ranging from almost any endocrine disease, to sleep disorders, to depression, to infectious diseases, to rheumatologic disorders, to . . . well, just about anything.  Fatigue is a very sensitive indicator that A health problem exists, but it is not very specific for WHICH one(s).  There are almost as many things that can cause weakness.  The one clue you mentioned about losing strenth in you hands raises a question of carpal tunnel syndrome.  Of course, carpal tunnel syndrome is pretty common, but it is especially common with hypothyroidism, diabetes, and acromegaly due to an excess of somatotropin (better known as \"growth hormone\" in kids, but actually the main pituitary hormone in adults).  Unfortunately, body aches are another signal that something is wrong, without making it clear what is wrong.  Most endocrinologists are discovering that vitamin D deficiency is surprisingly common and often produces \"vague\" symptoms, such as body aches.  Not everyone agrees (a long story!), but many of us also find that deficiency of somatotropin can produce profound fatigue, depressive symptoms, weakness, and sometimes pain.  One condition that causes fatigue and body aches and that is often associated with depression is fibromyalgia syndrome.  There are many ideas about what causes it (and some who discount its existence), but the best current explanation is that it is a type of neuropathy.  At any rate, it responds to the same drugs that many other forms of neuropathy do (especially certain \"antiseizure\" drugs).  Usually, the depression associated with fibromyalgia syndrome does not improve much with antidepressants, even though some of them are used for neuropathies (not very effectively, in my experience, despite their popularity).  It is hard to explain all of your symptoms with just one thing, but an extremely rare group of hereditary conditions called \"multiple endocrine neoplasias\" could go along way.  These conditions are characterized by various endocrine tumors that sometimes occur in different glands in the same person.  In the form that often produces pituitary tumors, a pituitary tumor could produce too much of one hormone, but damage the rest of the pituitary gland's ability to produce one or more of the other five pituitary hormones.   Is your flushing associated with sweating, warmth, fevers, chills, wheezing or difficulty breathing, diarrhea, itching, chest pain, low blood pressure or dizziness/faintness?  Do you have unusual headaches?  Have you ever had any head trauma? Where does your body hurt?  Does the pain seem to be in your joints, in the bones, or in the muscles?  What type of pain do you feel?  Is there any pattern in the time of day when the pain is worst?  Have you had any change in your weight?  Have there been any changes from your normal skin color?  Have you had any exposures to heavy metals?  Do you have any problems with your sleep?  Do you feel refreshed when you awaken?  I believe that a thorough evaluation by an endocrinologist would be a good starting point, but it does not seem likely that all of your problems will fit neatly into one endocrine diagnosis.  You are located in Jacksonville, FL, which is the home to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and a number of very good endocrinologists.  I suggest that you check our their web site, http://www.aace.com, to locate an endocrinologist.  You mentioned that you have been tested for different types of arthritis.  That is outside of my specialty, but some of your symptoms do strongly suggest a rheumatologic condition.  Some, but not all, of your symptoms sound like polymyalgia rheumatica or dermatomyositis.  Systemic lupus erythematosis is a great mimic, but I would assume that the testing you had has made that unlikely.  Inflammantion of the blood vessels (vasculitis) can produce all kinds of seemingly unrelated symptoms and be extremely difficult to diagnose.  If you have not seen a rheumatologist, you might ask to be referred to one, even though you have had a number of arthritis tests.  I hope that this is been helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for replying to my post Dr. Shank.     At first my doctor thought I had sero-negative arthritis or rhuematoid arthritis. I went to one of the best rhuematologists in Little Rock (I lived there until a few months ago) and he ran tests, and took x-rays and found nothing. I said that I didn't have arthritis or lupus even though the description sounds similar. My primary doctor also thought I had sjogrens syndrome because I feel dry and thirsty all the time. I drink about 20 glasses of water a day; its pretty much non-stop. And my nausia generally comes when I'm not drinking water. We ran blood tests for that and they came back negative as well. I asked her about carcinoid syndrome and she told me that the odds of me having it is rare and she never checked me. I will have it done though. The rhuematologist and my general doctor both told me to see an endocrinologist.    Whats odd about this whole thing is that I was completely fine, with no pain or depression ever in my life. But a little over a year ago I was playing racketball and started to feel pain in my arms and legs. A couple days later I fell on the court and couldn't walk for a few minutes because or back and leg pain. Shortly after that I started feeling sad and depressed all the time for absolutely no reason. I have always been extremely healthy and in great shape, running 5-7 miles a day, lifting weights all the time, but it seems like since that day my body has started crumbling. I have always been 6'2\" and in the military they measure you all the time. Now, according to my last three doctor visits at different places I'm 6'1\". I went from wearing a size 44 jacket to a 40. And I haven't stopped working out or changed my diet at all. All my muscle definition has started to go away. I have not went up a single pound in my bench press since May. And I also have extra weight around my stomach that just won't go away. No matter how much I run or lift. I only weigh 187 pounds but I used to be 195 of muscle. I wake up in the middle of the night because of bad circulation in my arms. They hurt and the pain wakes me up. My feet are also ice cold. How I described it to my girlfriend is that its like I had a glad that just stopped working all of a sudden and my body has been slowly crippling from the effects ever since.    My depression comes in waves. I can be totally happy and having a great time and within an hour just feel horrible and not want to talk to anyone. It might last a day or a week and then I'm fine again for a week or two. It's like my body is sending out too many chemicals or not enough at certain times and it really affects my mood.    What I regret to mention in my past post was that the flushing that I get on my face and neck I've always had. It may not have anything to do with the other things. I first noticed the flushing on my legs when I was in middle school. Over the years it has slowly traveled up my body and since about 2001-2002 it has been on my neck and face. I get it in the shower if the water is hot, if I'm under pressure, or for just no reason. I give a lot of presentations in my line of work and it really hampers my work abilities. My doctors seem to think that it is related but have no explanation for it.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear BRN:  The information about your very cold feet is helpful.  The redness and coldness of your feet strongly suggests Raynaud's phenomenon.  This is due to spasms of the blood vessels.  The classic presentation is cold skin, pain, and color changes from white (no circulation) to blue (stagnant blood) to red (increased blood flow to make up for the earlier reduced flow).  Frankly, I find this \"patriotic\" color pattern to be rare.  Usually, Raynaud's  is asymptomatic or merely anoying, but extreme cases can result in gangrene.  It is more common in women than men, is often aggravated by cold temperatures, emotional stress, or smoking, and is sometimes associated with rheumatologic conditions.  Fortunately, it is readily treated.  I am usually successful with low doses of a group of drugs that are commonly used to treat high blood pressure, the dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blockers.  I have never found this treatment in the medical literature, but the results are often quite gratifying.  A few people get swelling of the feet or ankles with the dihydropyridines, so my second-line therapy is nitroglycerin ointment--another highly effective treatment about which I have never seen anything in the medical literature.  Nitroglycerine may cause headaches for the first few days, and it does need to be applied several times a day.  The literature suggests that another group of medications usually used for blood pressure, the alpha-blockers, are also helpful, but my experience does not support their use.  Other possibilities for flushing that is exacerbated by warm showers are mastocytosis, histiocytosis X, or eosinophic granulomatosis.  Basically, these are due to cells of the immune system that sometimes overgrow and overproduce their chemical products.  The history that the flushing began in middle school, but that you were very athletic until recently, makes testosterone deficiency unlikely as the sole cause of your flushing.  There is a normal variation in the height of about 1/2 inch through the day.  A whole inch would be abnormal, if you were accurately measured.  Usually, the measurements are made with the (very poor!) stadiometers on the back of a weight scale, without proper positioning, and without regards to whether or not someone is wearing shoes.  Given your back pain and apparent loss of height, a DEXA bone density test would be justified, but it would be uncommon to have true loss of height due to thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) with compression fractures at your age.  The most obvious explanation for the sudden onset of pain is neurologic.  To have pain in both the arms and the legs (on both sides?) suggests a process in the spinal cord in the neck.  Another possibiity is multiple sclerosis.  in that case, the symptoms tend to be fluctuant and are usually worse when you are warm.  It is often associated with depression.  Fibromyalgia syndrome also needs to be considered.  The loss of muscle mass despite continued exercise and the belly fat are compatable with testosterone deficiency, but they are also characteristic of glucocorticoid excess (Cushing's) and somatotropin (\"growth hormone\") deficiency syndrome.  however, the later two conditions are typically associated with weight gain, rather than weight loss.  Do you have dry eyes, as well as dry mouth?  The definitive test for Sjogren's is a biopsy of the minor salivary glands of the inner lip.  Schermer's test for decreased tear production may also help to support a diagnosis.  Although it is hard to make an association with your other symptoms, damage to the back part of the pituitary gland (posterior pituitary, or neurohypophysis) or damage to a part of the brain called the hypothalamusan can also cause extreme thirst; if it is due to an infarct (loss of circulation) to the posterior pituitary, the onset can be so suddent that people can pinpoint the time it started to the minute!  Again, adrenal insufficiency (Addison's) can cause loss of fluids, weakness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and weight loss, but it is not associated with flushing or belly fat.  The sudden changes in mood can be seen with deficiencies of sex hormones (Think of women in menopause.), but bipolar affective disorder (manic-depression) needs to be excluded.\n\n",

    "content": "I have looked into Cushings and hypopituitarism and I have almost every symptom. My question is can I have Cushings without getting the excessive weight gain? All my research says that you get fat buildup in your stomach, upper back (between shoulders) and a rounded face. I have a very strict diet in which I eat no junk food, sugars, high protein, moderate carbs, and I work out all the time. I've been eating like this for years. I have the extra weight on my stomach that wont go away so is it possible that I can have Cushings? I went a month without working out and still eat extremely healthy and I gained 10 pounds.    About 4 years ago I was exposed to an active case of TB while in the military. I became a PPD reactor and went on INH. Is there a connection between TB medication and any possible syndrome? It seemed like I read a lot of information that mentions TB medicaion but not in any detail. I took the meds for about 9 months so I finished them in 2002. In between 2002-2004 (when all this started happening) the only thing I experienced was lack of oxygen when I ran. My body could take the beating but I just couldnt breathe. This still plagues me. Can the effects of such medications gradually build up and cause all these problems? I was finally able to get an appointment with an endocrinologist but its 8 weeks away. I only found one that would even see me in this entire city because my old doctor didn't send me to one for a specific test. I was told by everyone that I had to have a doctor tell them to test for ______ (fill in the blank) before they would see me.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear BRN:  The short answer is, yes, you can have Cushing's without generalized weight gain.  Textbooks present the \"cartoon\" versions of the disease.  The most important other cause of such belly fat is somatotropin deficiency (In fact, it is possible that Cushing's causes the belly fat by its effect to reduce somototropin secretion.).  I am sorry that you had so much difficulty seeing an endocrinologist.  Apparently, what has happened is that most of the endocrinologists in your area will only see patients in consultation (in other words, providing advice) to another physician.  Since your physician did not ask for advice, they are afraid of offending him.  INH does not build up and cause Cushing's disease.  How do you know that you have a lack of oxygen when you run?  Has this actually been measured, or have people assumed that \"short of breath\" means \"short of oxygen\"?  Even most \"lung specialists\" assume the later, even though oxygen deficiency is RARELY the cause of shortness of breath (Basically, it only causes shortness of breath just before you die!  Nearly all cases are due to increased work of breathing, a few are due to build up of carbon dioxide, and a very few are due to excess acid in the blood.).\n\n",

I have done some blood work and the only thing that is coming out high is Cholesterol 202 H NR0-200 and CO2 31 H NR 22-30.  I was told according to these results its possible that i have PCOD and since i had an appt to see the ENDO that he can handle the results.  The Endo that I saw ran  a 24 hour UFC test he said that I have alot of symptoms of Cushings. I was just told that the results came back 30 something his words but that the test were sent out and still needed to be guaranteed.  So I asked what was the next step he said that this was the one test to run to find it, and that I was expecting a miracle and i was not gonna find one. He told me he could give me provera to start having a menstrual and a diabetic medication to treat PCOD.  I am not looking for a miracle just answers.   I want to feel like a normal 27 year old.  I have a follow up on the 1st of March and would like to be prepared with questions.  I feel like im not getting him to listen or look at the BIG picture.  I don't know if I should just agree about being treated for PCOD and not actually have it.  What other steps can i suggest and what questions should i be asking.  Please any info would help\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Foxknob:  I note that your BUN and creatinine were elevated.   Besides kidney disease, this may also be seen with volume depletion (such as if you did not drink anything for a while before your test.)  Have the tests repeated, before you go off on what could be a wild goose chase.  The most common cause of a true elevated red blood cell count (erythrocytosis) is decreased oxygen levels.  This is most commonly seen in smokers with lung damage or in people with sleep apnea.  For about $50-80, a test of your oxygen levels overnight (recording pulse oximeter) can be performed.  If that is normal and you really do have an increase in your red blood cell count, then a hematologist consultatation would be reasonable, but you primary physician should go ahead and order an ultrasound, CT, or MRI of your kidneys to make sure that you do not have a kidney tumor (producing a hormone called erythropoetin).  Technically, polycythemia vera only refers to an increase in all blood cell lines, not just red blood cells.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Utleezard:  You need to see an endocrinologist.  I am an endocrinologist with a Ph.D. in Physiology and Biophysics for work on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid-peripheral tissues axis.  It would be unreasonable to expect most physicians to have the expertise that I have in thyroid, but, unfortunately, most know only what I call the \"cereal box\" version.  In spite of what you were told, a low TSH does not indicate hyperthyroidism.  Yes, hyperthyroidism is a possible cause, but it is hardly the only one.    TSH can also be low due to recent hyperthyroidism, despite current hypothyroidism.  This is commonly seen in the early phases of a common self-limited condition known as subacute thyroiditis.  TSH, T3, free T3, T4, and free T4 are often affected in poorly predicted ways during non thyroidal illness, such as infections, trauma or surgery, caloric restriction, and even depression.  By the way, most of what \"everyone knows\" about the patterns of thyroid function tests is correct for rats, but not true for humans.  From your symptoms, I suspect that you have true hypothyroidism and that this has been going on for longer than the roughly one month that this pattern of laboratory results could be seen in subacute thyroiditis.  That tells me that you most likely have \"central\" hypothyroidism, meaning that there is an abnormality in your pituitary gland or hypothalamus (the part of the brain that controls the pituitary).   T3 and free T3 are usually very well maintained in hypothyroidism.  The exception is when the hypothyroidism is severe.  Do not--repeat, do not--let anyone start you on thyroid hormones until a qualified individual has screened you for adrenal insufficiency and treated it, if you have it.  If someone says that he is going to test that by a cosyntropin stimulation test, find someone else.  The cosyntropin stimulation test is good for some things, but useless for evaluating the pituitary control of the adrenals (That does not keep non endocrinologists from using it for that purpose all the time, and then confidently interpreting it as if it were.).  Given what you have described, your headaches may well be due to a pituitary tumor, which may damage other structures (including the rest of the pituitary gland, resulting in possible deficiencies of other pituitary hromones) and secrete too much of another hormone.  Depending upon your age, you may have a tumor called a craniopharyngeoma that can damage your pituitary gland.  Brain tumors are rare and easily detected.  Infections (such as tuberculosis) and other conditions (such as sarcoidosis) very rarely affect the pituitary gland.  Head trauma is a common cause of pituitary damage, usually affecting the main adult pituitary hormone, somatotropin (\"growth hormone,\" in kids), but infrequently affecting thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).  If you do have a pituitary tumor, make absolutely certain that you see an endocrinologist first, before going off to a surgeon.  Most pituitary tumors should be treated with medications, not surgery!  Even those few tumors that need surgical treatment need to be evaluated, so that the endocrinologist knows what it was producing and what to tests to follow after the surgery.  Surgeons routinely say that \"it wasn't cancer\" (yeah, and it wasn't a jumbo jet liner, either!), he \"got it all\" (maybe, but you need proof!), and that there was no damage to the rest of the pituitary gland (and just how does he know that without testing??).  If you must have surgery for a pituitary tumor or a craniopharyngeoma, make sure that you are referred by an endocrinologist who knows your regional endocrine surgeons to someone who does LOTS of pituitary surgeries, rather than doing them as a sideline to a general neurosurgical practice.  Waiting six months is not a good idea.  If your primary physician will not refer you to an endocrinologist now, go to http://www.aace.com and look for an endocrinologist in your area.  You will be glad you did!  I hope that this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dumbfounded:  The endocrinologist may have been insensitive or socially inept, but I am not sure that he was quite as calloused as he sounded.  In the first place, the endocrinologist may be seeing your aunt as a consultant to another physician who is taking care of her other medical conditions.  It would neither be right nor prudent for him to take over areas managed by the physicians who sent him the patient.  Even if the physician who was managing her other conditions did not send her to the endocrinologist, the endocrinologist may not have wanted to risk offending a potential source of patients.  In the second place, you may be reading into his statement more than he said.  He did not say that the pain was unimportant, but only that the pain was a symptom of some other problem that he was trying to identify and treat.  This is much more commendable than merely treating the symptom while ignoring the underlying problem.  In the third place, many subspecialists limit there practices to their subspecialties.  Not only do they want to avoid perceived competition with physicians who might refer to them, but they often feel that they have become out of date or have lost their skills in general internal medicine.   In the fourth place, very few physicians are still willing to accept the inconveniences and risks (from state medical boards, state pharmacy boards, and the DEA) of managing pain.  I doubt that this comment would be of disciplinary interest to anyone.  Even if it were, I think that it would only be fair to the endocrinologist and in your aunt's best interests to clarify the roles of the endocrinologist and other physicians involved in her care.  Lest you think that I am automatically protecting another physician, let me tell you that I am an endocrinologist who changed from limiting my practice to my subspecialty to aggressively treating general medical problems, and that, by default, I have become the source for pain management for a lot of patients.  It sounds like your aunt's endocrinologist has made a different set of decisions for his practice than I have, but his decisions are probably very rational for his practice situation.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Punch:  Assuming that your wife is not pregnant (a fairly safe assumptin, with a macroprolactinoma) or attempting to become pregnant, there is no medical reason for chosing bromocriptine over cabergoline.  Period.  The ONLY reason someone MIGHT prefer to use bromocriptine during pregnancy is that, as a much older drug, it has been used in pregancy more often, so we are a little more sure that it is safe.  Having said that, the last I reviewed this topic, there was a significant body of medical literature showing cabergoline to be safe during pregnancy, so even that is a questionable reason to chose bromocriptine.  So long as pregancy is not an issue and cabergoline is available to you in England, the only other rationale for bromocriptine over cabergoline would be cost.  While the cost per pill is very high for cabergoline (best prices in the U.S. $30-40), I have patients who take 1/2 pill once or twice a week, which makes it cost competitive with bromocriptine at U.S. prices.  Since cabergoline is far more effective and much better tolerated than bromocriptine, if it were my wife, I would try to obtain the cabergoline, even if I had to pay the difference in cost.  My patients who think that they will save money on bromocriptine eventually come back and ask to switch back to cabergoline!\n\n",

    "title": "[no title]",
    "content": "Dear Step Paul:  Let me begin with the most straighforward part of your question.   Since B12 is produced by soil bacteria, it is virtually impossible not to get enough of B12 in your diet.  However, many people lose the ability to absorb it normally from their food.  It is very difficult to absorb B12 without a protein produced in the lining of the stomach, known as \"intrinsic factor.\"  Almost all B12 is absorbed in the last part of the small intestinge (the \"terminal ileum\").  Some people develop a B12 deficiency when this is surgically removed or severely damaged by an inflammatory bowel disease (Chron's disease or ulcerative colitis, both of which are \"autoimmune\" diseases, in which the body attacks itself), but this is pretty rare.  Another cause that would be rare in the \"developed\" parts of the world is an infestation with intestinal parasites (like tapeworms) that take up so much B12 that it does not make it to the terminal ileum.  Still another cause that is primarily seen in people with longstanding poorly controlled diabetes or certain surgical procedures (formerly commonly used for ulcers and now primarily used for weight loss), is overgrowth of bacteria in the first part of the intestines (the \"duodenum\"), again resulting in digestion of iintrinsic factor.  Another autoimmune condition, variously known as \"celiac disease,\" \"non tropical sprue,\" or \"gluten enteropathy\" results in damage to the lining of the small intestines and poor absorption of B12 and other nutrients. Sometimes people lose intrinsic factor due to stomach surgery, such as for weight loss (an commonly in the past, for ulcers).  B12 is stored in the liver, so you might think that liver diseases could cause B12 deficiency, but this does not appear to be the case.  By far the most common cause of B12 deficiency is an autoimmune loss of the normal stomach lining resulting in deficient production of intrinsic factor.  This is usually seen in the elderly, but is also common in people with other autoimmune diseases.   Since you are young and the information you have given suggests that you may may have deficiencies in other glands, I suspect that your body is attacking itself and destroying the cells in your stomach lining that produce intrinsic factor, along with damaging other glands.  That was the easy part!  Without lab results, the number of possible explanations for the remainder of what you describe is overwhelming.  However, since I suspect that you have an autoimmune disease of one sort or another, I will concentrate on the possibilites that fit that mechanism.  Whenever you find one autoimmune disease, you should look for others.  I have learned through painful experience with a variety of local and national labs not to trust a single set of low measurements of the main adrenal hormone, cortisol.  Unless this is confirmed on a set of measurements run separately, the chance is greater for a falsely low than for a really low value. Assuming that you do have an adrenal insufficiency, however,  I do not know whether your adrenal glands are not working because of a problem with them, or because of problem with the gland that controls them, the pituitary.  I will mention in passing the possibility of a non cancerous tumor of the pituitary gland, most commonly producing too much prolactin, and sometimes damaging parts of the pituitary that control other glands.  That would not help to explain your B12 deficiency, but I do think that at least a prolactin level should be checked, especially since you give a hint that your testes may not be working normallly, either.  One of the many possible causes of adrenal insufficiency is autoimmune, which would fit with the most likely cause of your B12 deficiency.  DHEA comes from two sources, one of which is the pair of adreanl glands.  That fits with what you said about your adrenal glands being \"exhausted.\"  The other source is the pair of gonads (testes in males, ovaries in females).  If DHEA is low because of abnormal function of the testes (usually due to an abnormality in the pituitary gland or in the testes themselves, such as autoimmune damage to the testes), testosterone levels would probably be low, too.   If DHEA is low due to abnormal function of the adrenal glands, DHEA-S (for \"sulfated DHEA\") should also be low.  How as the diagnosis of \"too many female hormones\" made?   You did not mention enlargement of your breasts (\"gynecomastia\"), but that is the most common reason for diagnosing \"too many female hormones.\"  Unfortunately, most physicians do not actually measure the female hormones (estrogens).  Since you did not mention testostorone levels, I suspect that estrogen levels were not measured, either.  If you are obese, your fat cells will convert male-type hormones (such as testosterone) to female-type hormones (estrogens).  If you have liver damage from toxins (such as alcohol abuse or carbon tetrachloride exposure), infectious diseases (such as hepatitis B or C), autoimmune disease (such as primary biliary cirrhosis or sclerosing cholangitis), or insulin resistance syndrome (fatty infiltration or cirrhosis known as \"non alcoholic steatohepatis\" or \"NASH\"), your liver may not be able to break down normal amounts of estrogens (produced from testosterone and other male-type hormones), so the levels may be high.  There is a whole field dealing with so-called environmental estrogens, which are estrogen-like compounds used in pesticides (like DDT), plastics, and a wide variety of other applications, and then there are certain foods, like soybeans, which are naturally rich in estrogen-like plant substances (\"phytoestrogens\"), but I do not believe that these would have shown up, even if you did have standard laboratory tests done.  Without more information, I cannot be sure that you are not describing \"testicular feminization,\" but that would probably have been diagnosed early in life.  Other rare causes of too much female hormones are tumors, such as an exraordinarily rare tumor called a \"teratoma\" (sometimes described as being like forming a partial fetus), testicular tumors, and a group of rare tumors known as \"neuroendocrine\" (such as carcinoid tumors).   At your age, the most common causes of breast enlargement would be too little testosterone, durgs that block the effects of testosterone (such as spironolactone or cimetidine), or marijuana use (Sorry women--it won't work for you!).  Proper treatment is dependent upon proper diagnosis.  Endocrinologists are the physician experts in hormones and metabolism.  I strongly suggest that you see an endocrinologist.  I am sure that The Endocrine Society of Australia (http://www.racp.edu.au/esa/index.htm) would be delighted to help you find an endocrinologist, but it does not list members on its website.  The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists does have a physician-finder (http://www.aace.com/resources/memsearch ... ion=doSrch), but it only lists 9 Australian members.  I trust that this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am finally getting in with an endocrinologist.  My primary doc did a cortisol test in the morning and it came up as 1. She also did a 24 hour cortisol test and that came up low as well, though I don't know how low. Low enough that she is trying to get the appointment for me.    but now I am pannicking because for the last 2 days,my eyes are not working right. It is very hard to focus and I feel very sick. My eyes feel like they are wobbly and everything looks blurred or like it has a shadow. Lights are the worst and so is reading. please forgive any mistakes I have made because if I proofread I will be like car sick.  can this be by the cortisol problem?  I am planning to ask my doc as soon as possible, but I feel terrible calling  if it is not important, but i really hate this feelling.It is horrible.  Thank you for your earlier replies and for you time again.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jill, I am glad to hear that you are going to be evaluated by an Endocrinologist. The adrenal glands (located just above your kidneys) produce hormones (one of which is a group of glucocorticoids) When these gland produce to little cortisol a disorder that results is Adddison's disease. This is not to imply that this is what you are suffering from but used as an example. Signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency may include hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), nausea, vomiting, fainting, fatigue, muscle weakness,  etc. etc. The blurred vision and nausea may be related to episodes of low blood sugar and cortisol levels. I would suggest that you notify your physician of these new symptoms. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

Since I changed to better insurance, I got more freedom and now I have a doctor who is willing to work with me, and he is free to do what he wants. As long as I try the things he wants me to try, he will do testing for anything I ask (so long as it makes sense, of course). I am still doing my own research too of course.  Anyway, thanks.

    "content": "First of all, I'm an 18 year old male.  I started off quite normally in terms of hair growth. I have quite a lot of hair on my legs, around my penis and on my stomach, but hardly anything on my chest. I have facial hair in the moustache region and the chin, but on the sides of my face, only thin transparent hairs grow (ie: the same hairs that grow just before puberty and real facial hair appears)  Considering that I have quite a lot of hair in other areas, this seems strange to me, and I wonder whether my growth has been 'stunted', so that hair that should have developed on my chest and sides of my face didn't.  I would like to have the option to grow a beard if I want to, so I was wondering whether there was anything I could do to make real hair start to grow.  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "content": ":)  I have just been sent to an endocrinologist because my GP test for hormone levels showed elevated testosterone. when i spoke to her she was convinced i had pcos.She did a scan of my ovaries but they looked slightly enlarged but no cysts.i did a prolonged glucose tolerance test and am awaiting results. she told me that before i went back to see her however she wanted to start me on metformin.   I have a history of absent periods since i came off the pill 4 and half years ago. i normally have 3 cycles of 6 weeks running back to back every year to year and a half since then.  just before i went to see her i had a period. The day i started the tablet i had noticed a pink color on tissue like i was nearly due to start a period (it had been about 4-6 weeks since previous). then for the first 2 days days all i got was black clotts and occassional unclotted blood which was extremly light hardenly at all noramlyl use tampons but flow too light and erratic. then i got a brown colour blood i think and mucus that got lighter and lighter and that was it. i noramlly have fairly heavy periods?  is this the tablets? and if so how are they effecting me in that way. I have been feeling very weak and tired (have slept 12 hours some nights) since i started them and have had aggravated IBS. wake up in night also feeling unwell (hard to describe like i have a viral infection but then it passes).  have been on them 11 days now.   many  thanks  :lol:\n\n",

Ultrasounds may or may not show PCOS but the symptoms speak louder.   It is common for woman with PCOS to have insulin resistance. Research is finding metformin useful in the treatment of pre-diabetes, diabetes, endocrine abnormalities and PCOS. Some of the side effects you can expect as you start the medication can include diarrhea, upset stomach and a tired or run-down feeling, more should be listed on the pamphlet the comes with it. Metformin have a capsule that doesn\u2019t dissolve, it\u2019s a carrier only for the medicine so you may notice a swollen \u201cpill\u201d after a bowel movement, that\u2019s normal and is suppose to happen.   As far as metformin causing you to bleed, it can cause you to start having a menstrual flow again as it changes your hormones. If the bleeding and clotting carries on to long, please contact your doctor to make sure all is well.\n\n",

    "title": "Leg bruising they are saying is an autoimmune disease! HUH??",
    "content": "was recently in the hospital with an undiagnosed rash that turned my whole legs black and blue, at first they were concerned with flesh eating disease. I was in hospital 10 day undergoing numerous tests. Now almost 3 weeks after getting out of the hospital, my lower legs are bruising all over, with some bruising just above and around my knees. My legs hurt extremely bad, I am using 2 tyelnol #3's every 4 hours and it still feels like I have deep charley horses, for lack of a better description. My legs are also very weak, I actually fell the other day as my right thigh muscle just gave way. My doctor tells me I have myalgia, which really is just leg pain. It seems more than this to me but I don't want to become one of \"those people\" who rush to the ER and waste their time if this is nothing urgent. I am unable to walk long periods and stairs kill me, I am crawling up them. I work 6 days a week and can not afford anymore time off, what can be causing this?? Please help as each day there are new bruises and more pain. As a side note, while in hospital they did many blood tests and liver function was perfectly fine. I am soo frustrated now though!

    "title": "Re: Leg bruising they are saying is an autoimmune disease! H",
    "content": "[quote=\"Daysma\"]was recently in the hospital with an undiagnosed rash that turned my whole legs black and blue, at first they were concerned with flesh eating disease. I was in hospital 10 day undergoing numerous tests. Now almost 3 weeks after getting out of the hospital, my lower legs are bruising all over, with some bruising just above and around my knees. My legs hurt extremely bad, I am using 2 tyelnol #3's every 4 hours and it still feels like I have deep charley horses, for lack of a better description. My legs are also very weak, I actually fell the other day as my right thigh muscle just gave way. My doctor tells me I have myalgia, which really is just leg pain. It seems more than this to me but I don't want to become one of \"those people\" who rush to the ER and waste their time if this is nothing urgent. I am unable to walk long periods and stairs kill me, I am crawling up them. I work 6 days a week and can not afford anymore time off, what can be causing this?? Please help as each day there are new bruises and more pain. As a side note, while in hospital they did many blood tests and liver function was perfectly fine. I am soo frustrated now though! The doctor has prescribed the T3's as I refuse to take anything stronger and Elavil for \"myalgia\" ANY IDEAS WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED!!!!  I have no Back pain at all or hip pain, it does not hurt to sit at all in case you thought this was from my back at all, I have been asked that before. My doctor has put me on high dose, 120 mg per day of prednisone to supress my immune system in the hopes this will help.  I have lost a kidney and have had a hysterectomy that they contribute to my own antibodies attacking my body!  Any ideas on how to stop this??\n\n",

    "content": "Hey i know there have been alot of topics about this but i didnt actually find an answer to my questions in any of them.  basically, a bit over 4 years ago i noticed a lump under 1 nipple that made the nipple alot bigger than the other.  They have been on an off, and now they are under both nipples, and my nipples are usually kinda big and dark (puffy).  This is more so to my left nipple.   When they get cold or i press them they go hard and look normal.  I went to see this friend of my mums whos a doctor and she dismissed any chance its breast cancer, but i also want them to go away because theyre embarassing.  My questions are: is there anything i can do about these lumps? If there isnt, will they go away eventually? And will my nipples look normal and not puffy once theyre gone.   p.s. they are also embarassing because i am getting into shape now and they make it look like im fatter than i am..  Thanks alot for the help\n\n",

Well I would ever since puberty began I have noticed somthing different.  At first I didn't really notice anything until later years come and now its full blown on. I have these symptoms, I have a racing heart or tachycardia pretty much all the time, I have these weird purple red stretchs from about my armpit to about the crease in the arm.  I get shakes and sweating real bad if I don't eat.  I have sweating literally all the time.  When I was little I was beyond skinny never had any fat on me.  And now I have gained fat in the abdomen section around the neck and my face seems to have gotten fatter.  I am really worried.  I am on celexa and robinol forte.  The whole thing that got me started was my really fast heart beat and sweating.  It was runing my life I was constantly thinking about sweat stains but I have drysol now.  I went to a endocronologist and got my cortisol level tested and that was about 1 year ago.  And at first it came back that it was really high, I got it tested against with a shot in my arm I was supposed to fast but I ate somthing at like 2 in the morning. and then it came back normal.  Im wondering if I have cushings disease but now it has progressed bad.  I read on cushings disease recently and it said somthinga bout stretch marks on the arms.   These stretch marks are really weird.  I need some help.\n\n",

    "content": ":? WELL HI, SWEETY!! IM LOOKING UP INFO ON CUSHING DISEASE, AS I AM A MEDICAL ASSISTANT STUDENT, AND  Symptoms vary, but most people have upper body obesity, rounded face, increased fat around the neck, and thinning arms and legs. Children tend to be obese with slowed growth rates.  Other symptoms appear in the skin, which becomes fragile and thin. It bruises easily and heals poorly. Purplish pink stretch marks may appear on the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, arms and breasts. The bones are weakened, and routine activities such as bending, lifting or rising from a chair may lead to backaches, rib and spinal column fractures.  Most people have severe fatigue, weak muscles, high blood pressure and high blood sugar. Irritability, anxiety and depression are common. Cushing's syndrome occurs when the body's tissues are exposed to excessive levels of cortisol for long periods of time. Many people suffer the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome because they take glucocorticoid hormones such as prednisone for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other inflammatory diseases, or for immunosuppression after transplantation.  Others develop Cushing's syndrome because of overproduction of cortisol by the body. Normally, the production of cortisol follows a precise chain of events. First, the hypothalamus, a part of the brain which is about the size of a small sugar cube, sends corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) to the pituitary gland. CRH causes the pituitary to secrete ACTH (adrenocorticotropin), a hormone that stimulates the adrenal glands. When the adrenals, which are located just above the kidneys, receive the ACTH, they respond by releasing cortisol into the bloodstream.  Cortisol performs vital tasks in the body. It helps maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function, reduces the immune system's inflammatory response, balances the effects of insulin in breaking down sugar for energy, and regulates the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. One of cortisol's most important jobs is to help the body respond to stress. For this reason, women in their last 3 months of pregnancy and highly trained athletes normally have high levels of the hormone. People suffering from depression, alcoholism, malnutrition and panic disorders also have increased cortisol levels.  When the amount of cortisol in the blood is adequate, the hypothalamus and pituitary release less CRH and ACTH. This ensures that the amount of cortisol released by the adrenal glands is precisely balanced to meet the body's daily needs. However, if something goes wrong with the adrenals or their regulating switches in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, cortisol production can go awry.  HOPE THIS HELPS A LITTLE.. IT SOUNDS LIKE ITS HITTING THE NAIL ON THE HEAD!!  KEEP FINGERS CROSSED! ANGELA\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Docs,  This is a 26 yr old male still bachelor. I am going through a very difficult time.   My History I have doing the wrong stuff (masturbation) for several years. Recently I noticed that I have developed the symptoms of testosterone deficiency They are palpitation, excessive sweating, being lethargic, depression and to some extent sleep less ness. In addition am having hair loss problem \u2026. A doctor said it was male pattern baldness. I have been using some medicine that reduces the generation of DHT and thus hair loss problem can be controlled to some extent.   I was never a smart guy but now am putting lots and lots of fats I weigh 94 Kg  = 200lbs and my height is 5-10 = 176 cm \u2026 I know that I m over weight  Question My question is this that if I start some heavy exercises like body building etc\u2026. will it help me to regain the testosterone levels. Because I have read many a times that the testosterone replacement techniques (injections, tablets, patches and lotions) results in a temporary boost in testosterone level. Please note that although I ll like to have pleasure in life but I m even willing to sacrifice my sex life if there is a way of getting out of this lethargic ness which I m facing.  There is no doctor in my city who can help me out with this, therfore i m asking u learned ppl for advice...... Thanks in advance for your replies  Best Regards, Confused 26\n\n",

    "content": "Exercise will help you increase your testosterone levels. How much, I don't know. Here's what you do. Figure out a good working routine, and a good routine will often mean you will spend as little time on those machines as possible. The most important of the exercises is the squat and the deadlift. These take practice, but when done correctly you will be amazed. Squats allow for you body to use so many muscles at once that it allows for a better increase in growth hormons.  Remember though, a good routine is nothing compared to a good diet. Make sure you figure out maintanance calories (The calories it takes for you to maitain your current weight.) If you figure those out, drop them by about 20 percent and keep lifting. If your maintanance calories was at 3000, then drop them by 600. You will be eating 2400 a day. Control what you eat. This means tracking everything. Use http://www.fitday.com for this. Always weigh your food, don't use size as a means of measuring. Once you've done that, you clean up your diet. This means eating 1~1.5 grams of protein per pound you weigh. Eat 0.5 grams of fat (Healthy fats, but also healthy saturated fats, they help support your endocrine system and actually promote testosterone) The rest of your diet can be made up of carbs. Try to eat most of your carbs before and after you workout.  Since you are a beginner, I'll give the best routine there is to start anyone off.  Day 1 : Chest and Back  Chest   Flat Barbell Bench Press : 2 x 6-8 reps  Low Incline Dumbbell Press : 2 x 6-8 reps  Dips : 2 x 6-8 reps   Back   Chin ups : 2 x 6-8 reps  Deadlifts : 2 x 6-8 reps  Barbell Rows : 2 x 6-8 reps  Shrugs : 1 x 10 reps   Day 2 : OFF   Day 3 : Legs   Squats : 2 x 6-8 reps  Hack Squats : 2 x 6-8 reps  Leg Curls : 2 x 6-8 reps  Straight Legged Deadlifts : 2 x 6-8 reps  Standing Calve Raises : 4 x 10 reps   Day 4 : OFF  Day 5 : Shoulders, Triceps and Biceps   Shoulders   Military Press in Rack : 2 x 6-8 reps  Seated Dumbbell Press : 2 x 6-8 reps  Standing Lateral Raises : 2 x 10 reps Triceps :   Narrow Grip bench Press : 2 x 6-8 reps  French Press : 2 x 6-8 reps   Biceps :   Barbell Curls : 2 x 6-8 reps  Hammer Curls : 1 x 6-8 reps   Day 6 : OFF  Day 7 : OFF  If you're not sure how to do one of the exercises there are plenty of sites that can show you. Do not read fitness magazines. Join a proper lifting board and meet the people who know what they're doing because they've done it.   The above routine is from http://www.wannabebig.com\n\n",

Oatmeal is the only food I kow that raises testosterone. Good Luck. Go have your hormones tested.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I've had extreme cold intolerance for the past 9 years. Endocrine problems have been ruled out and all my tests are normal.  It's not just an annoyance. All year long (even in the summer) I have to wear thick socks, a hat and scarf, and a jacket--even when I'm sleeping. I can only sleep with an electric blanket and 4 thick blankets on top of it. It's the end of May and I'm still using the electric blanket.   My ideal room temperature is 90 degrees. I can only wear a T-shirt when the weather is 90 degrees. I never sweat.  I become nauseous when I'm cold. I get a headache and my thinking becomes blurry.   It takes me a long time to warm up after I'm cold. I won't warm up if I sleep under 5 thick blankets. The blankets just preserve the cold. Heat has to be introduced into my body through an electric blanket, a heat pad, a warm shower, or a hot drink.  Cold intolerance has caused me to be fatigued all the time. It also has triggered headaches and migraines. I spent 4 years with chronic daily headaches. The headaches are gone now, but I'm still always cold.  I'm 32 now. My body temperature is 97.8 - 98.2 usually -not significantly low. It's my hands, feet, head, chest and back that are always cold.   The other symtoms that I have are fatigue and headaches, but I think the cold intolerance is what causes them, because they are much better in the summer.  My periods are always normal. I'm 5'1'' and 118 pounds.  I've gone to several endocrinologists who have ruled out any hormone problems. I've also gone to a holistic physician. He put me on slow release T3 (Wilson's protocol) but it didn't help.  Does anyone have a hunch what the problem might be? Does anyone have an idea which doctor can help me?  Thanks, Sarah\n\n",

I would like to know if there is any treatment available to decrease the size of my thyroid.  I would also like to know if the increased size of my thyroid could lead to any long term damage.  Lastly, I would like to know if it is possible that hypothyroidism could go undetected by blood tests considering that I gained 20 pounds in one month.  Also, could an abnormally functioning adrenal gland cause the same symptoms of weight gain?  Thank you for taking the time to answer my question.  Have a great day!\n\n",

    "content": "Im 36 yr old Vegetarian Female. Im 5'7\" and normally weigh around 130 to 140 MAX ( 163 when I gave birth to my daughter 10yrs ago). I currently weigh 195lbs. I was diagnoised with a Pituitary adnoma when I was 19. Nine months ago my fiance died unexpectidly and I was put on high dosages of anti depressant Lexipro, which had a negative effect on me. The first couple of months I actually lost a little bit of weight, but then I  gained about 40lbs in about 5/6 months. I stopped taking Lexipro about 3 months ago thinking that was the cause of my weight gain, but I continued to gain weight ..about 6/8lbs this last month. With no change to my eatting habits, or any other habits. My weight gain continus to increase with no real cause it seems. My Dr. tested my thyroid and he said it was normal. (I had it tested about 3yrs ago as well and it was a little on the low side). I am now to take a 24hr cortisole test. Im praying this might show something, if not..I don't know what Im going to do. Im so beyhond frustrated. I have absolutely no energy and it continuing to get worse every day. It seems my armpit lymph nodes are swollen also....or Im just getting really fat there...I don't know!?!? My stomach is where the majority of the weight gain is, but my breast have also increased pretty substantially in size as well. When I wake up my calfs muscles are really sore. My hair is thinning. I seem to sweat more than normal lately. My vision got a little weird today and I also noticed today the right side of my neck is sore and a bit swollen.Ive had a cronic mild cough now also for at least a year if not more.  Im also VERY irritable and cranky.  I have no insurance and lost my job due to the weight gain so Im going to a low cost clinic and feeling just very frustrated and that they are not taking me serously.  They tell me to just eat better and excersice and talk to me like Im 5. I know all this...but I don't have the energy TO excersice. After work I literally have no energy to do anything but go home and lay down Im so exhausted. I don't think this is related to depression either. Ive had boughts with major depression before, but this is different. I have the desire to go out and do things. I WANT to..I just don't have the energy and strength to do so. Whereas with depression previously I just didnt have the desire to do anything. Im freaking out wondering when this weight gain is going to stop....as Im rapidly approaching 200lbs!\n\n",

    "content": "You need an ultrasound of your thyroid, some of these symptoms could point to a thyroid nodule, like me. My numbers were fine too, on antidepressants, but extremely fatigued and not doing anything  seriously no energy.  I recently got my answer even though my doctors thought I was just \"crazy\".  I also don't believe it is depression either. I went through everything your are, but don't give up. You know how you feel. Insist on also thyroid antibodies since these are not doen with the normal thyroid fuction tests. Also make sure they look at your parathyroids, these usually don't cause cancer but play a major role on your body, causing alot of unwanted symptoms. Most doctors don't concentrate on the parathyroids as a problem. Hope everything goes well.  What worries me is the cough, you don't say if you smoke, I do so I know it can be a sign of possible thyroid cancer, like mine, but I smoke( I know being a nurse I should know better)  Let me know how you make outl\n\n",

    "title": "possible fluctuating thyroid disorder???",
    "content": "For several months, I have been experiencing strange symptoms.  Initially, I would have a rapid heart beat, spike in bp (i.e. 150/94), flushing, hives, and light headed.  They first treated me for an allergic reaction.  I responded poorly to the steroids and my bp went soaring.  I was hospitalized.  They did numerous tests including pheochromocytoma, carcinoid, and MRI of abdomen.  All was normal.  All blood work was also  normal.  I was released and started seeing different doctors.  My symptoms persisted but were random.  My epidsodes of rapid heart seem to happen only at night (115-120); same with bp spikes.  I get light headed to the point of almost passing out at random, but when I am sitting or lying, not standing.  Orthostatic problems have been ruled out.  I also experience fatigue, weak/rubbery legs, achy legs, blurred vision, headaches, jitters, mood swings, constipation, and stiff neck at times.  These symptoms occur in groups or alone.  I can be fine for a few days or weeks and then I'll have a bad spell, lasting a few days or weeks.  I have lost a ton of hair, developed acne, and my emotions are all over the place.  It seems worse around my period.    One theory was that I had an autonomic imbalance.  I've tried beta blockers, Florinef, calcium channel blockers and anti depressants, all fo which have made me feel much worse.  I don't really believe this theory anymore because of the fluctuation of symptoms from barely there to flaring.  Some days I can't get out of bed while others, I'll feel almost normal.    I began looking back over my tests and noticed that my TSH level was fluctuating.  In January, it was 1.83.  In March it was .86.  In May, it was 2.82.  I had it checked last week and it was 3.2.  They tell me it is odd to see these fluctuations but that it is within the normal range.  They also said my antibodies were in normal ranges as well.  I've read alot about thyroid disorders and believe this may actually be the culprit.  Something is definately fluctuating in my body, causing problems.  I am different, week to week.  I also have a low basal body temp, averaging 97.0.  Can a thyroid bounce back and forth between hypo and hyper (I seem to have both sets of symptoms).  How is this disorder detected?  Should I have my levels checked on a weekly basis?  Is there anything more I can do?  The docs just don't seem to be interested.  I am 29 year femail, 5'6\", 150 lbs (recently gained 15 lbs in four weeks).  I just want my normal life back.  At this point, I can barely work part time.  Any light you can shed on this would be appreciated.  I am located in Northeast Ohio.\n\n",

I am having several odd symptoms that do not have any apperant relation to one another.  If anyone can give me any ideas please do, I am open for all ideas.  All I know for sure is that I'm reaching the point where I don't know how much longer I can deal with all of this. Symptoms:   extreme weight gain (46lbs between age 24-26 to a weight of 167, then frequent swings in weight that averaged 10-15lbs until 3mts ago, when I put on 24lbs in 2mts.  This was all done with no lifestyle changes (with the exception of 4mts of fertility treatment between the ages 25-27), and I have never--pre24y-o-a--had a weight problam and have always enjoyed outdoor activities (yard work, gardening, farming, hunting, camping, and fishing).   Facial/chest hair   vaginal dryness   fatigue   infertility (8-years-present)   hair loss (scalp)   irregular menstraul cycle  (no problems pre-22)   mood swings   dry skin (this has been progressive)   bad short-term memory   strong arm pit odor (noticably increased aprox 24 y-o-a)   brittle finger/toe nails   heartburn/indigestion (noticable around 24-25)   little clearish cycst on hands that feel like splinters under the skin,  they usually go away after a week or so, unless I make the mistake and believe that I can remove them, then they react like grimlins that have gotten wet.  I don't know how else to explain all of the things that are going wrong with me.  I am 29 and walk 2 miles/day and use the stairs at the hospital instead of the elevator, my diet consist of fish, venison, chicken and vegetables, wiht the exception of carats and beets (this are the foods that I have always eaten, as a child and as an adult).

    "content": "I wait to assure you, you are not crazy. I have many of the symptoms you have and now I find out that I have a suspicious nodule on the left side of my thyroid.  Symptoms started while pregnant with my last child 5 years ago. I told my ob-gyn that I was feeing depressed and I was told it was my hormones which of course made sense. I just knew I wasn't \"feeling right\" My work suffered and my family suffered even after my delivery. I had such mood swings, and angry all the time, let alone being tired, hair loss, not wanting to do anything. I was always someone who could take control of anything. I couldn't control this. I finally went to my family md who said I was depressed. I just couldn't accept that , I asked  \"but what is causing me depression?\" There was no answer. I took the medicine on and off, but nothing changed. Symptoms getting worse. I couldn't stand being tired all the time. I decided that work was too much because everyone and everything got on my nerves.  In March, I decided to do internet research and found adrenal insufficiency and got a home test that showed my testosterone was high. I than went back to the family md and told her the medicine isn't working I need something to give me energy. At this time, I was having more hair loss, hoarseness, throat pain, severe sinusitis, enlarged axillary lymph nodes,gai ning approx 15 pounds over the past year. never had problems with weight. I wanted an answer. Went to an ENT, Endocrinologist, and will be going to a Rheumatologist soon. After all tests, thyroid function tests all \"normal\", an MRI showed an 8mm nodule. I convinced my ENT to order a thyroid scan - normal. followed with Endocrinologist what told me I need to change my medication, and that my hair loss had nothing to do with my thyroid, because numbers were normal ( I know what kind of endocrinologist says that) I did not stop there. I made her order a thyroid ultrasound, which showed 2 hypervascular, hypoechogenic masses with positive Doppler color flow imaging throughout each nodule.  I need a fine needle biopsy of this nodule, but my endocrinologist has not gotten back to me in 3 weeks.  I'm sorry for all this info but what I'm trying to say is go with your gut instinct,If you think something is wrong, it probably is. If you  don't think your doctor is listening go elsewhere.   I am an emergency room nurse with 18 years experience, and I always tell the doctors to listen to their patients, not the numbers.  So do not take no for an answer, it is your body and you know what is normal for you. Don't let anyone make you feel that you are crazy. Everyone wants to believe that if you're a woman, everything is your hormones.\n\n",

If you have PCOS, then being treated for it will make it easier for you to lose weight.  As for the worry about infertility, if you do have PCOS and have problems getting pregnant, then there are pretty good treatments to induce ovulation and allow you to get pregnant. If you are worried about the ultrasound, I would consider getting a thorough physical exam and lab work and you could postpone getting the ultrasound until you are more comfortable with it. You say you think it can't be PCOS because you have to be childbearing age and 16 isn't childbearing age. Childbearing age only means physically capable of child bearing-- not when it is good to have children. One classic sign of PCOS is to have normal periods for a period of time and for them to then become irregular.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 22 years old. Since I have been 14, i have had irregular periods, and in the past 2 years, i have not had a period at all. In 1998, my lab tests showed high amounts of DHEA sulfate, Cortisol, Prolactin, and testosterone. A 3 day dexamethisone test was done and i had a positive response... very tomporarily... i was also taking bromocriptine for the prolactin, which i had no response to. I now have recurrent severe headaches mostly on the right side of my temple and head. My medical history also includes carcinoma in situ of the cervix(dec. 2003), a very premature delivery of my daughter (born at 26 weeks gestation, jan 2002), and an appendectomy(july 2004). For some reason, everytime i go to the doctor, they run tests and things come out normal, but no one ever has any answers as to why this is happening. i'm afraid i may have a pituitary tumor, or i am at risk for infertility. what's going on? what steps can i  take to find out? and did i have my daughter early becuase of a possible pituitary failure that made me produce too much oxytocin? please help.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 26 year old mother of two small children and have been hypothyroid for about 4 years now.  It started out as postpartum thyroiditis after my first child was born and eventually I went hypothyroid and went on replacement.  Then, after the birth of my second child, 2 years ago, I again went into thyroiditis, then back to hypo.  I've been on replacement since.  Even though replaced and with my levels supposedly \"normal\",  I went to my doctor multiple times in tears because of my extreme fatigue.  I developed a goiter and nodules and was referred to an ENT, who told me that my level had been at around 4 and should be around 1.  My dose was increased and I felt better for awhile, but for about a year and a half now I've been extremely fatigued again with a mirage of odd symptoms:  hair loss, sensation of being so cold every afternoon that I have to take a hot bath to warm up even though no one else in the house is cold, a strange lightheaded/shaky/\"buzzing\" sensation, mood swings, terrible \"brain fog\" (I used to be very intelligent and quick, now I'm slow and get disoriented) and just recently I've developed weakness and pain in my legs whenever I go up stairs or exert myself.  It's progressed to where I can't even walk up a small ramp holding my 20-pound daughter without pain in my legs feeling like I've just run a marathon and making me feel like I'm going to pass out.  I am by no means overweight and I live in a two-story home, going up and down stairs all day long (carrying my daughter because she cannot climb them), so there's no way I could just be that out of shape.  I am so tired all of the time that I am often in tears when it's time to wake up, no matter how much sleep I've gotten.  It is a huge task to clean my house or even balance my checkbook.  I've had my TSH, T4, and T3 all checked twice in the last two months and was told they were normal and had my iron profile checked last week and was told that it was normal as well.  I feel like I'm going crazy.  Every time I see my internist he suggests more antidepressants even though I am already on two (symptoms began before going on them) and do not feel sad or depressed.  I feel like they think I'm a hypochondriac.  I've finally been referred to an endocrinologist but can't get an appointment for 3 months.  Does anybody have ANY idea what is going on with me?  Please help!\n\n",

I also had slightly high cholesterol (241) when I had a lipid profile done, and I have high blood pressure.  I should not have these things considering how I eat and how active I am.  After doing some research on the net I found that high cholesterol and blood pressure can be caused by low test, as well as gyno (I have developed a minor case, but it may be from puberty and just more noticeable since I have put on 60 lbs of solid mass in the last 3 years from working out and my pecs are just pushing it out).  I have never done steroids or taken anything to tamper with my hormones.  So I am just looking for answers as to why its so low.  Can a varicocele cause test levels to be low?  Its hard to tell but it might feel like I may have one, and my testicles MAY have atrophied a little (its hard to tell since pretty much every other part on me has grown from my powerlifting hobby, and they are just proportionally smaller now).  I have to wait until Feb of 2006 to see an endo, since they are so hard to get an appt with.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  I'm 25 yrs old, 115 lbs, height 5 -04, hypothyroid.  I have had polyuria and polydipsia for the last year. I 'm drinking 1 gal + 1liter of water every day. I take only water as beverage, I don't drink anything else.  I have lost 5 lbs in the last month without doing diet.  Even at nights after I take that much water, I still feel thirsty.  When I don't drink that much water I really feel thirsty the next day.  I was on Synthyroid 100 mcg on august. In sept my Dr. Endocrinologyst changed my med to 75mcg for a month, then he changed to half of that 37.5 mcg (I'm on this dose now and it's been 1 month). He said my pituitary and other glands and things in my body are OK (he took osmolality test , TSH, vasopressin).  I went to see the urologist in sept or august  to know what was wrong with me. He said my kidney was OK, and sent me a sulfa antibiotic because there was pus in my urine and I had itching and discharge and burning while urinating.  The tests showed I did not have an UTI but I took the sulfa anyways.  He sent something for my bladder which effects I could not stand and I stop taking that. I have not stop taking my thyroid medicine, but I do not know if my thyroid is causing the polydipsia, the polyuria, maybe an infection that could not be seen in lab tests.  Another   is that I am not feeling better at all since they have change my synthyroid dosages.  I'm still very fatigued, I have muscle pain, dry skin, itchy scalp, dry hair, no energy, and drowsiness during the day.   The only thing is that I do not have the headaches I had before.  But every 30 min I go to the restroom and I usually wake up once in the middle of the night to urinate.  It's a nightmare to live with this! I have no energy to do my activities, and believe me exercise has not help me much. Besides of all of this I get really depress before, during and after my period and during the rest of the monthe my mood is OK. I am seeing a councelor now. Do you think I am goig to ever get better? Is there something you think I can do?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,        I was wondering if someone could answer a question I have about low body temperature.  I've been going to my doctor for about a month now dealing with problems with facial pressure, headaches, ear pain, eye pain, etc..  My doctor was not entirely sure if the problem was allergies (which I have pretty bad) or a possible inner ear or sinus infection.  I have always had pretty bad sinuses and I live in The Ohio River Valley in Louisville, which is known for bad allergy sources.  He put me on a week's course of Baixin about two weeks ago.  I've head a head CT scan which came up normal.  My blood has been tested several times, including blood counts, thryroid, and immunology tests.  They all came back normal, as did a urinalysis they did for possible infections.   My question is regarding my temperature.  Early on I had mild possible fever with temperature being around a degree higher.  For the last three weeks or so my temperature is usually always around 97.3-97.9 degrees.  I've read somewhere if the body is fighting allergies or is stressed this can be normal.  My doctor doesn't seem to worry about it.  It's weird though, because unless I'm very ill I almost always register at a the regular 98.6 line.  Thanks in advance.                               Kevin\n\n",

My endocrinologist has given me two choices.  To have part of my thyroid removed so it can be tested for cancer or to wait another 2 months and have another ultrasound to see if it's still growing.  Had ultrasound done last June and it showed both had grown slightly. I've been on Synthroid for almost 3 years now and am concerned about my metobolism if thyroid is partically removed since I have ulcerative colitis too (and I try to keep my weight normal so colitis doesn't act up.) I don't know what to do?  The endocrinologist said the downside of removing only part of the thyroid is if it is cancerous, then they will need to go back in and remove the entire thyroid...\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Texasgypsey,  You have to take your thyroid medication. There is a generic for it called synthroid. i don't think it is that expensive. Before you move, you can call your previous doctor and ask him to renew your prescription or give you a one year refill.  You have to stop taking levothroid for one whole week before its effect starts to ware off.  If you stop taking it, you will start to have symptoms of hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland) and these can be slow thinking, fatigue, constipation, dry skin, cold intolerance and others. It is an essential hormone in the body, if your body does not produce it, it has to be replaced.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Pronurse, Much of the symptoms you are describing could easily be due to the menopause. Frequency of micturition especially causing you to wake from sleep warrants a blood sugar test to exclude diabetes (especially since you have a family history). I do not think you should do a CA-125 test as it is too specific and your symptoms can be caused by too many things. I just wanted to make sure that there really are lymph nodes in the neck. The fact that they are hot and tender is usually good news, indicating that they may be caused by a nearby infection as opposed to the dreaded possibility of malignant disease. Every possibilty should be performed to find a source of infection. If none is found an emperic antibiotic is given for two weeks. If still persistent then they are investigated to rule out malignancy.  You see the point in your case is that you have many unrelated symptoms which can be very confusing. The only way to deal with this is put your hand on the most significant symptom and proceed investigating that. You then proceed to the following symptom in order of clinical significance.  In my opinion that would be the lymph nodes then possibly the abdominal pains. The fact that you have a history of IBD tends to reduce the clinical significance of abdominal pains. Ofcourse as I mentioned earlier if you are complaining of frequent urination then a blood sugar test should be done right away.  Please note that in a clinical situation as complex as this one, my opinion would be less valuable really compared to your current physician, given the obvious constraints of the internet.\n\n",

I look practically the same now as I did about seven years ago.  Does it sound like I could have low testosterone or a pituitary disorder or something like that?   Is there any kind of treatment, such as testosterone therapy, that could help me develop a man's body and appearance?  I hate being mistaken for a high schooler.  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

I stay tired all the time, I have really bad cycles, I through a box of tampons in three days, I have to wear tamons and pads at the same time, I pass clots, I have very low iron.  My hair is and skin is so dry, my hands and feet sweal all the time I can hardly wear my rings in the morning.  I have leg cramps and the bottom of my feet burn.  I have anxiety and panic attacks.  Now that I have complained enough let me express to you that I have had my thyroids checked, my mother had to have hers removed.  my doctor told me it was low but worked and gave me no meds for it.  My blood pressure is higher than before @140/85 which is high for me.  I am currently taking 100 mg. of Zoloft daily, and 0.5 mg of Xanxa only when needed, a 30 day Rx usually last me 3 - 4 months.  I feel like I am failing apart and I just don't think I am getting the right help I need.  I am at my last straw here and I hope someone can help me.  I don't know what my test results where however I am sure I can get them if you need them.  I thank you so much for your time and understanding.  I also want to stress that for some reason every problem my mother has had I too have it almost at the same age.  We both had our Gallbladder removed at 28 years old and have the same dental problems, if that makes sense to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Strange symptoms!",
    "content": "Hi, wondering if anyone has ideas about this. I'm hoping to get an appointment this next week to get it checked, but I'm really worried so far.  I'm a 29 years old, female. To start with, recently I have started a health program - I've stopped eating sweets, have cut back my \"refined\" foods, and have started exercising (yoga, and a strenuous walk about three times a week). On the weekends I walk in the hills or nature areas. At the start of this (about a month and a half ago) I was about 25 pounds or so overweight, I have since lost about five pounds and one and a half dress sizes. I seem to be getting into 'good shape' and toning up my muscles.   However, here is the weird part. I've always (since childhood) had hypoglycemia issues. Recently it has been really bad. Plus I have been having recurrent female infections. WHENEVER I eat anything with sugar, or high carb, my heart starts racing. Since I am a high risk (family, previous blood sugar issues) for type 2 diabetes, I'm going to be getting checked really soon.  What's really strange is that lately I have had a weird, \"low grade flu\" type bug on and off for weeks. It feels like I am \"going to get sick\", or \"just getting over something\", but I never really get sick per se. Then when I do get sick, I start feeling like I have a low fever.   Part of it is that consistently, every lymph node in my body seems to twinge or ache. I had a swollen lymph node in my neck which got really big, but it went down, then other ones started twinging. It's off and on. I've had little aches and twinges in practically every place off and on. I also sometimes get where my throat feels like it's going to close and I have to keep drinking, this is off and on, not constant.   The weird part is I DON'T REALLY FEEL SICK! Sometimes just this off and on 'eeehhh' feeling. Example, I just got back from a very strenuous hike in the hills in back of my house, and handled it just fine.   Sometimes my heart races at night, but this could be anxiety I suppose?   I am going to get checked out next week I hope. Anyway I am hoping someone writes to me, I am a little weirded out, I have never seriously (other than the blood sugar, and being overweight) had cause to worry seriously about my health before.  Thanks.  Dreia\n\n",

This last symptom is particularly odd.  I smell cigarettes when no one else does and even when I'm alone in the car.  My eyes and throat burn as if smoke is right in my face, yet no one is around.  The instance of the hypersensitivity seemingly coincides with the onset and duration of ovulation and menses.  The hypersensitivity first began while pregnant and the other symptoms began approximately 6 weeks after I gave birth and have not subsided.  Note that I breasfed exclusively for 18 months.  Any ideas what might be going on? Point Loma Mom\n\n",

I've had TSS, phuenmonea (5) times, and numerous other infections.  It seems like my body's ability to fight infections is steadily decreasing.  I used to suffer from infections and viruses on a monthly basis, now it just seems like I cant get rid of them. Last time I had strep throat it took 45 days of antibiotics to get rid it.  I recently had blood drawn and the results were confusing.  Although my thyroid is continually becoming larger my T4 test came back fine.  The T3 results were conflicting.  The T3 uptake was low while the T3 total was high.  My test also reported a WBC of 18 and a neutrophil count of 14000.  I have no idea what to think of these results.  ANy advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "HI some of the symptoms you have mentioned are very common in patients with cushing syndrome.  Cushing's syndrome is a hormonal disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol  Symptoms vary, but most people have upper body obesity, rounded face, increased fat around the neck, and thinning arms and legs. Children tend to be obese with slowed growth rates. Other symptoms appear in the skin, which becomes fragile and thin. It bruises easily and heals poorly. Purplish pink stretch marks may appear on the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, arms and breasts. The bones are weakened, and routine activities such as bending, lifting or rising from a chair may lead to backaches, rib and spinal column fractures.  Most people have severe fatigue, weak muscles, high blood pressure and high blood sugar. Irritability, anxiety and depression are common.  Women usually have excess hair growth on their faces, necks, chests, abdomens, and thighs. Their menstrual periods may become irregular or stop.  some of the common diagnostic tests for this syndrome include: 1), 24-Hour Urinary Free Cortisol Level,  2) Dexamethasone Suppression Test  3)CRH Stimulation Test 4)Direct Visualization of the Endocrine Glands (Radiologic Imaging), and 5) The Dexamethasone-CRH Test   i suggest that you talk to your doctor about it, and to have any of these tests performed. the first test i have mentioned under 1) is the most specific.  remember that Treatment depends on the specific reason for cortisol excess and may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or the use of cortisol-inhibiting drugs.   than k you very much, and i hope you feel better.

    "title": "Very low serum cortisol levels after admin of mexadethasone",
    "content": "I just received my lab results back and am shocked by the findings. My cortisol level was only .4 after administration of mexadethasone, and the normal level is supposed to be 6.7-22.1. I have already been diagnosed with PCOS and Antiphospholipid Syndrome (Hughes Syndrome), along with chronic obesity. It has taken me YEARS to get a doctor to listen to me when I say I eat healthily and exercise 5 days a week but still put weight on, and the general attitude is that I'm just lazy and eating poorly. My nutritionist actually asked to have me tested for high cortisol, but we found it to be just the opposite. She suspected I had Cushing's Syndrome, but from what I've read so far it seems that I would have Addison's Disease. Does this sound correct? Can you please tell me what such a low level of cortisol would mean and how it will affect me?  I cannot get in to see my doctor until next month due to travel plans, and it would be nice to finally know what on earth is wrong with me!!!!!   Many thanks for any and all suggestions, comments, and assistance! LS\n\n",

    "title": "Do These Symptoms Add Up To Hypothyroidism Or Something Else",
    "content": "Hi there,  I am a 46-year-old woman, overweight, with symptoms of fatigue and borderline high blood pressure. A blood test recently indicated a slightly elevated TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) level.  I have acid reflux due to being overweight and having a hiatal hernia, plus lately I have had more acid, throat pain, and some ear pain in the morning upon arising. Lately I also notice more tickling in my throat and the sensation that perhaps a gland is swollen in it. Also I have been looked at because I have swollen lymph glands under my arms (doctors checked for breast cancer and tests have not shown any sign of it) The nodes are not hard to the touch, but more of the infectious type.  I take provera tablets to control my menstrual cycles. I took birth control pills for over ten years to control heavy periods and related female problems. I then became an infertility patient at a large clinic and successfully became pregnant and had a healthy baby girl by c-section in 2000. Prior to becoming pregnant I had surgery to remove a large fibroid and I also have polycystic ovarian syndrome. I would like to know if my hormonal history and my current symptoms suggest  hypothyroidism or some other problem with my throat?  I will visit the internist next week to discuss my blood test, and apparently everything came back okay except for the elevated TSH. I am worried by the throat pain, which seems to be in the tissue of my throat, and I wonder if a thyroid nodule is there/ Thanks for your kind help! Sincerely, Lisa, lisashetler@yahoo.com\n\n",

    "content": "Hi! As far as your symptoms go, you might jolly well be hypothyroid; again, I need to know your TSH and free thyroid hormone levels before I can comment. I suggest you go in for an oral examination and a clinical examination of your neck although similar symptoms can be elicited by GERD.  Your palpable nodes under your arms are definitely a concern at this age. If mammography has not been dne, I recommend it highly. Also, do you have any sort of infection in your hands or arms? Check out your blood sugar at the same time. Best wishes......\n\n",

    "title": "Re My TSH Level Results, Throat Symptoms....",
    "content": "Hi Doctor and thank you for your previous and very helpful reply. Here is the latest and I would appreciate your opinion about it. They did one thyroid-related test, the TSH and it came back as 7.15. Everything else in my bloodwork and urine test came back normal-- RBCs and WBCs are normal, urine is normal, glucose is normal (84), and my readings for \"comprehensive metabolic\" were normal. The only abnormal result was the high TSH, and its reference range \"yardstick\" was listed as .27-4.20. Also my blood pressure was around 147/96. The doctor was not there and so they assigned a physician's assistant to me---he was helpful. He suggested that I go on a low dose of thyroid medicine, saying I am slightly hypothyroid so he wrote a prescription for \"levoxy--something\" and also a prescription for blood pressure meds, saying that at leas for now I should go on them, til I am able to get my weight down a bit, as I am overweight. I told him about my throat symptoms and he said that goiter only goes with hyperthyroid and not hypothyroid, which is the one I have. I asked him if we should scan for a nodule on my thyroid, but he did not seem to think it was necessary. However, since I have had someodd sore throat symptoms which seem a bit different from my usual acid reflux, and since I have a high tsh, do you think I should have a scan to look for thyroid nodules or thyroid cancer?  I do not smoke or drink so hopefully it is not a throat cancer but I do wonder what it could be. I realize that thyroid cancer and throat cancer are actually two different things but anyway would like your opinion. I continue to have on and off hoarseness too, some ear pain and sinus pain. Ih ave read that these can indeed by thyroid related but don't know if that applies to me. Thanks for your help! Sincerely, Lisa, lisashetler@yahoo.com\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lisa, Yup, your TSH is on the higher side! Judging from all the facts, I would recommend you to take 25 microgram of levothyroxine in empty stomach before breakfast every day. We can then monitor the TSH level after about a months' time and then I can suggest yu further. Do remember that one of the major functions of TSH is stimulating growth of the thyroid gland so there is no alternative to a clinical examination! About your hypertension, I won't label you as a \"hypertensive\" until you have documented elevation in blood pressure on 3 separate occasions. Record your BP on 2 more occasions and then I'll suggest you another medication for the same.   Don't be worried for being overweight: just try to have some regular exercise and cut down on your junk foods. Try to go in for a diet chart of 1500 kcal to begin with and then taper down to 1000 kcal until you have achieved your desired weight loss. Once you lose weight, you'll feel mentally and physically much better and your BP would come down too!!! Best wishes..............\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  Yes, your TSH is definitely elevated but what's more important is what your Free T4 and T3 levels are - those are the actual hormones that the thyroid gland produces.... TSH is \"thyroid stimulating hormone\".....if it's elevated, it means your thyroid is working extra hard to produce the correct hormones ........... people w/ underactive or \"hypothyroidism\", their hormones will be on the low side..which is why you're supplemented with the levothyroxine.  Just so you know, a person w/ hypothyroidism CAN definitely have a hoarse or husky voice...and the strange feeling you have in your throat, that CAN be present for those with HYPOthyroidism, too....particularly if you have Autoimmune Thyroiditis (which a person can have thyroid nodules).  I highly recommend the following site....I belong to it myself (I have autoimmune thyroiditis).......they have message forums like this one .... where you can learn more about thyroid disease, speak with others who have either hyper or hypothyroidism, learn more about symptoms, blood tests, etc.  The following link (just click on it) will give you great info on thyroid nodules, goiter, symptoms of hypothyroidism, etc:  Link 1  You might want to join the Forums there, so you can learn more about hypothyroidism, and ask any questions you might have.  (I'll post the link below).  You might also want to ask your doctor for a referral to an Endocrinologist - that's a specialist who deals with issues/conditions of the thyroid gland.  Link 2  Your blood pressure at your appointment was definitely elevated but it also could have been elevated a little due to just the anxiety of being at the doctor's office, and your concerns about your symptoms.  Now that you're on this BP med, be sure you get your BP checked weekly at least.....if at your doc's office or if you have one of those home BP machines.....or your local clinic/health unit.  The only way your doc can know if it's the correct med/dose is if you have your BP checked regularly, keep a log of the readings..to show him.  Also, your TSH and T4/T3 levels should be rechecked in 2-3 months.............to ensure your dose (it's a relatively low dose) doesn't need to be increased.    I have autoimmune thyroiditis...which caused me to be hypothyroid.  When I was first diagnosed, the doc (not my regular one) started me out on a very low dose like yours......but I asked for a referral to an Endocrinologist..and he increased it (3 months after diagnosis, based on new bloodwork) it to 100mcg.\n\n",

You can find information about it by searching it out on the internet. So cheap, no copay or big prescription price. Something about the level of acidity in it makes your digestive system respond appropriately. Good luck and I hope we both can loose some weight. Tea and caffeine upset my reflux.

    "content": "Hello, I have written on here in the past about the severe bleeds that I experienced the day after my first delivery and 7 months in to my 2nd pregnancy. I think that you can look them up, they were under the OB section. Anyhow, after seeing a couple of ENT specialists the only conclusion they can come up with is that the bleeding was from te spenopalatine artery and had something to do with hormones because of both occurances being during pregnnacy. I have had a tubal under advice from my doctors because the first time it hapenned it was very severe and the second was almost fatal. The specialists have said that I could go to another hospital for an angiogram which could perhaps find and fix the problem but in weighing the risks and the fact that I will no longer be pregnant. I have opted not to. They are hopeful that it will not happen again as am I as you can imagine.  My questions to you, since you are experienced in teh area of hormones are 1/ have you ever seen this(posterior bleeds lasting a week requiring transfusions during pregnancy) 2/could the hormones in menopause trigger it again or are those hormones less 3/ is it possible that the body goes thru changing hormonal cycles. When I stopped taking oral contraceptives after 10 years I had some minor bleeds...exactly 15 montsh later I had a week of the severe ones and exactly 15 montsh after that I was in another week with them again. We are almost up to 15 months again and of course I am a bit leary lol!!!!  Thank you for your time and any thing that you feel would give me some more ideas to understand this would be appreciated. My doctors here were absolutely wonderful but do not have the knowledge in hormones that you may have, Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "title": "Thyroid disorder...or cancer?",
    "content": "I have a very fat neck and have for several years.  It seems to be a goitre but the blood test was okay.  I have several symptoms indicative of a thyroid disorder.  Almost four weeks ago I started to feel very tired.  I went to the doctor a  couple of days later with the following symptoms:  Extremely swollen, painful lymph nodes on the left side of my neck (all the way from the tip of my ear down to my clavicle).  Fever (occasional), malaise, aches and pains, and extreme fatigue.  GP did a CBC and mono test, both were normal/negative, and gave me 1 week of Augmentin, and then 1 week of Levaquin.  I felt horrible for about 9 days and have felt okay for 10 days.  All symptoms are gone except the swollen lymph nodes, and maybe slight fatigue.  I went to the ENT who did a FNA.   I also had a CT of the neck.  Biopsy didn't show anything malignant, just reactive, inflammed cells, CT showed only swelling (from what my doctor said).    I even went to the dentist today, and he did a bunch of X-Rays and thought he saw something, but thinks it was just a shadow after viewing the second X-Ray.  Still, he referred me to an Oral Surgeon.   After that I called my GP in tears because no one can tell me anything definitive.  All of my practicioners have said something about my thyroid, though, indicating a very obvious \"roundness\" in the middle/lower part of my neck, like my neck sort of has a \"spare tire\" around it.    They all think infection.  I don't know.  My lymph nodes have never been THIS swollen for THIS long.  And now some lymph nodes on the right side have started to pop up, though not as much as the left.  Could I have something wrong with my thyroid even though the blood test was normal?  Should I be concerned about cancer?  All the docs say they cant find any evidence of cancer, but refuse to rule it out, even after a biopsy.    They keep telling me not to worry, but of course I'm worried and it's easy to say \"don't worry\" when it's not your problem.  I am depressed and anxious about all this and I feel as though it has taken over my life.  I'm sleeping more than usual, and I can't figure out if it's because I have fatigue or because I'm depressed.\n\n",

T3 and T4 are thyroid hormones which people who have hypothyroidism (like you) cannot produce. Maybe you were put on a lower dose than necessary! Maybe you have T3 specific deficiency! You would need to go to a physician and have a thyroid profile checked which can identify if you have isolated deficiency of T3 (which is why novothyral works for you). Or you can just continue to get the drug in mail and use it. don't you have a primary care doctor here? Im sure they could help you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Danny,  Height is mostly genetically determined. If your parents are tall, you most probably will be tall, if they are short, so will you.  165 cm is not a bad height at your age. You still have a couple or three years to go on growing taller before you stop.  If you are really concerned about this matter, i would recommend that you be seen by an endocrinologist, a doctor specialized in endocrine glands.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear brattie04:  Technically, your physician is correct, BUT . . . .  These LH & FSH levels are normal, IF they represent the midcycle surge that should result in ovulation (release of an egg).  However, the facts that you have had irregular menstrual cycles and have just discontinued HRT make me suspect that they are actually elevated due to relatively low estrogen levels.  Unless he obtained estrogen and progesterone levels at the same time, it is impossible to know.  The fact that he measured LH and FSH right after stopping the HRT tells me that your physician was probably not an endocrinologist (a hormone specialist).  Have you had thyroid function testing performed?  This should be automatic for menstrual abnormalitiies, but it is often overlooked.  Make sure that you hve a free T4 and a TSH level.  Despite whatever the pathologists' reference range may be on the lab, a TSH greater than 2 is definitely abnormal and is usually due to  hypothyroidism.  Another very common cause of irregular menstrual periods at your age is PCOS.  Much to-do has been  made of \"cysts\" on the ovaries, which are usually nothing more than the \"follicles\" that produce eggs (although there are exceptions to this rule). In extreme cases of PCOS, numerous follicles form but do never rupture to release an egg, because of secondary abnormalities that develop in the hormonal control of ovulation. Surgeons noted these abnormal follicles, biopsied them (because that is what surgeons do), and accidentally treated the abnormal production of androgens by reducing the amount of ovarian tissue that was producing them. To this day, many people mistakenly believe that \"cysts\" (follicles) on the ovaries are the cause, rather than the result.  We now know better, but, until we can agree upon a better name, the condition is officially known as \"PCOS\" (which no longer stands for \"polycytic ovarian syndrome\" or anything else).  PCOS results from elevated \"male-type\" hormones (androgens), almost always as a result of insulin resistance with compenstory elevations in  insulin levels (to keep the blood sugar normal) that stimulate the ovaries to produce \"male-type\" hormones  (Very rarely, it can be due to elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, as a result of acromegaly.). Since all naturally occuring \"male-type\" hormones are converted to  \"female type\" hormones (estrogens), it is unlikely that PCOS or the other causes of excess \"male-type\" hormone production would account for the potentially elevated LH and FSH by themselves.  However, temporarily reducing  \"male-type\" hormone levels by suppressing the ovaries with HRT and then stopping it could produce exactly this picture, until the ovaries recovered (most likely after a few months).  Prolactin levels should always be checked, but they rarely are.  Abnormal menstrual cycles may be the only evidence for a large tumor on the pituitary gland, and it is possible that the LH and FSH levels were artificially elevated by the prior months' HRT.  Premature menopause is an uncommon of abnormal menstrual cycles and elevated LH and FSH at your age, except in the presence of other diseases in which the body attacks itself (\"autoimmune\" diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, most thyroid diseases, many rheumatologic disorders, Chron's disease, ulcerative colitis, and a variety of others).  I have found that ob-gyn's usually dismiss this possibility out of hand.  Your physician should at least think about it, even if he concludes that a diagnostic evaluation is not warranted.  As a minimum, your physician should check free T4, TSH, prolactin, testosterone (preferably free testosterone), baseline 17-OH-progesterone (and if in the upper limits of the normal range or higher,  after a cosyntropin stimulation test), DHEA-S, and either DHEA, androstenedione, or both (Even though thse terms are probably unfamiliar to you, he will know what they mean.). In addition, he should measure a fasting blood glucose and insulin level, which will allow him estimate your body's resistance to insulin using a well-known formula known as \"HOMA.\" In selected cases, an IGF-1 level (to screen for acromegaly, caused by too much somatotropin or \"growth hormone,\" which is a rare cause of PCOS), adrenal gland imaging (to evaluate for adrenal masses or provide clues about congenital adrenal hyperplasia), or ovarian imaging (to exclude an ovarian mass--NOT to look for \"cysts\") should be performed.  I suggest that you see an endocrinologist for a second opinion.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I have a very serious problem in my sexual life which seems to be that my libido has dropped through the floor in the last few years (I am 41). I have had testosterone tests done (both free and bound) although both were within normal ranges. The doctor offered me testosterone supplement for a month anyway \"to see if it had an effect\". I don't seem to have noticed one so far.   I was also tested for thyroid levels, and it was found that I was *slightly* overactive (??). Is there any way this could be causing this problem? Where or how do I look now to resolve this? It was disappointing that testosterone levels were \"normal\" as it seems that it must be something physical and I cannot account for this loss of libido. I also have had symptoms of unusual tiredness for a few years...lack of energy etc, but again, nothing solid was found. Any help possible beyond what has already been done?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear lightpanther:  You say that you have lost your libido.  For the purposes of this response,  I assume that you mean that you have lost your sexual appetite, rather than just your ability to achieve and maintain erections or to ejaculate.  You seem to be describing a gradual onset, which traditionally has been thought to favor a physical cause, but can also be seen in relational problems and psychiatric disease.  Since you characterize the problem as \"serious,\" I assume that it is not due to relationship problems, although you may be implying that it is causing such problems.  Male sexual appetite is much more resiliant than the female sexual appetite, and its loss is a strong predictor of a physical or drug-related cause.  Furthermore, it is now recognized that nearly all  male sexual problmes have a physical basis.  Let me give your physician a great deal of credit for checking your testosterone levels.   Without more information, however, I would not be ready to conclude that your problem is not related to testosterone.  In the first place, every lab that I have ever seen has highly unrealistic reference ranges for testosterone, because they were not derived from samples from known healthy individuals.  Changes in proteins in the blood that bind testosterone (such as \"sex hormone binding globulin\") can have large effects on the amount of testosterone that is readily available to have an effect (the \"free testosterone\"), so I commend your physician for being (unusually) savy enough to also obtain a 'free testosterone\" level.  Unfortunately, problems with reference ranges are even more severe with this test, and it takes a lot of experience with the specific laboratory and the specific test that was done at that laboratory to properly interpret the results.  As a rule-of-thumb, however, at your age the free testosterone level should probably be between 2/3 and 4/3 of the midpoint of the lab's reference range (In other words, take the average of the \"high\" and \"low\" reference values, then multiply it by 2/3 to get the approximate true lower limit and multiply it by 4/3 to get the approximate true upper limit.).  The fact that you did not respond to testosterone replacement therapy does not necessarily mean that you were not deficient, either; I cannot stress enough that the changes in testosterone levels with any given dose of testosterone are extremely (!) variable.  Having said that, I would like to take up you next point, that your thyroid was slightly overactive.  This was also a good thought on the part of your physician.  However, I have learned to take non endocrinologists' interpretation of thyroid function tests cautiously, because an elevated level of thyroid stimulating hormone (or TSH, which does exactly what its name suggests) is often interpreted as \"high thyroid.\"   Laboratory diagnosis of hyperthyroidism should be based upon elevated free T4 or free T3 associated (with extremely rare exceptions) with a low TSH.  If total T4 or total TSH were measured instead of free levels, a major abnormality could appear \"slight.\"  An old test for estimating free T4, the free thyroxine index (FTI or \"T7\") is still occasionally used and causes no end of confusion, because a measurement that is used internally by the lab (T3 resin uptake or T3RU) soley to calculate the index is inappropriately reported by the lab, and then mistaken for a measure of T3 (Believe me, you do not want to know the story behind THAT measure--it is very complicated and extremely confusiing!).  Every laboratory reference range for thyroid function tests that I know about is wrong, for the same reasons as for testosterone measurements.  In additon, they ignore the recommendations of the American Thyroid Association, the Endocrine Society, and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists.  Fortunately, however, most laboratory's results seem to be comparable, even if their reference ranges are widely discrepant.  In answer to your question, yes, abnormal thyroid function could cause problems with sexual function, but they are less likely to cause problems with sexual appetite (at least in men).  Either too much or too little thyroid hormones can casue the fatigue that you describe.  You did not mention a prolactin level, which should be automatically included in the workup of any sexual dysfunction.  If this has not been done, be sure that your physician orders it.  Elevated levels can cause sexual problems in their own right, and not (as is commonly believed) only because they sometimes reduce testosterone levels.  However, so long as the testosterone levels are normal, it is more likely to cause problems with sexual function than with sexual appetite.  A large number of medications can interfer with sexual function, and some of them can also cause loss of sexual appetite.  Certain antidepressants are among the worst offenders.   Spironolactone (Aldactone) and cimetadine (Tagamet) do not reduce the levels of testosterone, but do block the effect of testosterone.  A careful review of all of your medications should be part of the evaluation.  Sepression itself can cause a loss of sexual appetite and function, but depressed people usually do not complain about their lack of sexual appetite.  Most people know that sleep apnea syndrome can cause fatigue, but it is less well appreciated that it can cause sexual dysfunction.  Apart from the resulting fatigue, however, I am not aware of it causing a loss of sexual appetite, and, unlike women,  men seldom let anything less than a profound degree of fatigue get in the way of their sex lives.  Somatotropin (\"growth hormone\" in children) is the main adult pituitary hormone.  In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that this plays important roles throughout the body.  Deficiencies can result from head trauma, pitutary gland tumors or surgeries, radiation treatment to the head and neck, and a variety of other causes.  Nost of us were trained during the days when \"everyone knew\" that somatotropin had no role in adults, because \"adults don't need to grow.\"  Most endocrinologists still have either not yet accepted its importance or use outmoded criteria for diagnosing a deficiency (I do not want to overwhelm you with a history of how these criteria came about, but the original reasons are no longer valid.).  Suffice it to say that sexual dysfunction (incuding loss of sexual appetite) and fatigue are often prominent features of a deficiency, but they are seldom the only ones.  The only advise that I can offer is to seek out an endocrinologist with a strong interest in this area, if no other cause can be identified.  Significant liver disease may also cause male sexual dysfunction, at least partilaly because of increased build-up of estrogen.  Excessive alcohol use with or without significant liver disease, can cause low testosterone levels by a variety of mechanisms, but sexual dysfunction may result even with normal testosterone levels.  Commonly, this is associated with a lack of sexual appetite, even with normal testosterone levels.  Heart disease has been reported to reduce sexual appetite, but this is controversial (The connection between atherosclerosis (\"hardening of the arteries\") and sexual function is not controversial, however.).  Advanced kidney disease may be associated with a loss of sexual appetite and/or function.  Neuropathy (such as from diabetes, alcohol abuse, or B12 deficiency) is a major cause of problems with sexual function.  It is less likely to cause a lack of sexual appetite, however, except indirectly (as a result of a lack of sensation).  Very often, I find that there is more than one cause of the sexual problem, and treating just one of them is not effective.  If you have not yet seen an endocrinologist, I would suggest that you do so.  I hope that this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 38 year  old female who has suffered from SEVERE PMS since I was 11!! (Before they   even labeled these symptoms!)  Over the years, since about 9 \u00bd when I started my onset of menses, I have suffered with severe hormonal related problems (mood  swings, depression, acne etc) that would come on me like a ton of bricks  (around ovulation) and then miraculously disappear the day of my period!    In 1995, my obgyn found  an ovarian cyst on my left (which is still there)  and now (within the past 2 years) there is one also on my right ovary, I  suffer from elevated androgen levels (400!) elevated estrogen levels,  elevated fsh on day 2, all else seems to be wnl. I had a needle aspiration  where the doctor took out the fluid in both of the cysts and it seems as   though my fsh returned to normal and the estrogen dropped, but then the   cysts came back and filled up with blood. I do not ovulate and the past 3   periods have occurred around day 35! (My whole life, they have occurred   between day 24-26)   I am at the end of my rope, because NOONE seems to want or be able to help   me. I have asked every question I possibly can, including going in there with a printout from webmd asking, could I have pcos? how about endometriosis? There has to be a cause. I can't understand how my androgen level would just shoot up to 400... The answer... take spironlactone, it will go down. I am a registered dietitian so I have some (very limited) knowledge but I am NOT getting answers. I am actually the one asking if the cyst is he cause or effect of my hormonal imbalance (i tend to think the effect, since I've had hormonal problems since early on and the cyst only since 1995)   I've seen 3 obgyns-a regular ob gyn-she wants to prescribe the 3 meds mentioned earlier to relieve the symptoms (BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CAUSE) A fertility specialist that isn't too interested in discussing these issues .. he just looks at the fsh level and dismisses me by saying.. looks like you need an egg donor  and the third an oncologist gyn- he advises let's remove the cysts (through an incision across the pubic bone) and see if they come back.  I am truthfully at my wits end here and I don't know what else to do!   My priority has to be hormone regulation, because these symptoms are becoming unbearable: 6-7 pounds weight gain per month for approximately 10 days, mood swings, acne, hair, back ache and feelings of fatigue, anger and sadness without much cause.  I do believe that this imbalance has caused the infertility and I just want to feel well!    I am willing to pay a fee for your time! You guys, as a profession, are  underpaid as it is!   Please advise  Donna\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dietpro1, Endometriosis in some women exhibits no signs or symptoms. However, when symptoms are present they cause severe menstrual cramps, heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, low back pain, and infertility. Advanced edometriosis may cause adhesions that involve other structures including  the ovaries causing midcycle pain and produce ovarian cysts such as endometriomas/chocolate cysts. Diagnosis of this particular disorder is usually discovered during a pelvic exam and by a laparoscopic view. Simple/functional cysts containing fluid without debris are much less disconcerting or worrisome than blood filled and  solid cysts. PCOS is also linked to infertility and many women with this disorder have an underlying metabolic disorder, insulin resistance. These women are at higher risk for developing high cholesterol, high triglycerides, heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. Medication to increase insulin sensitivity such as metformin are commonly used. The recommendation for ovarian cysts that do not disappear within 2-3 menstrual cycles require further evaluation so I am in agreement with your third physician (oncologist gyn) about removal of the cysts to also evaluate any underlying pathological disease, although this may possibly be done during a laparoscopic procedure. I would also suggest a referral to an Endocrinologist to identify any hormonal/metabolic disorder. I hope this information has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dietpro1:  I agree with Rntdj that you need to see an endocrinologist.  Endocrinologists are the hormone specialists. Ob-gyn's are primarily trained as surgeons, and few have an in-depth knowledge of hormones.  As an endocrinologist who has co-authored a review on PMS,  I would like to add to Rntdj's excellent comments.  You are describing more than one problem.  The first is premenstrual syndrome, which, as you describe, has a variety of features.  The literature is fairly clear that the best treatment for the depressive component is the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's).  Some women seem to benefit from manipulation of the hormonal cycle associated with the menstrual cycle.  The prominence of acne is consistent with your statements that you have very high androgen levels; while spironolactone will block the effects of androgens, and is effective to eliminate the acne, unwanted hair, and  hair loss (pattern baldness), but it will not address the underlying cause, and it cannot be used during pregnacy or attempted pregnancy.  The second is the elevated androgen levels, themselves.  You did not say which of the many androgens (\"male\" hormones) was \"400\" or give the units.  If you are referring tototal testosterone in ng/dl, then this is extremely high for a woman, representing the low end of the normal range for a man.  Find a physician who will measure order measures of testosterone (preferably free testosterone), 17-OH-progesterone (baseline and after a cosyntropin stimulation test), DHEA-S, and either DHEA, androstenedione, or both (Even though thse terms are probably unfamiliar to you, he will know what they mean.).  In addition, he should measure a fasting blood glucose and insulin level, which will allow him not only to exclude diabetes and impaired fasting glucose, but estimate your body's resistance to insulin using a well-known formula known as \"HOMA.\"  In selected cases, an IGF-1 level (to screen for acromegaly, caused by too much somatotropin or \"growth hormone,\" which is a rare cause of PCOS) or adrenal gland imaging (to evaluate for adrenal masses or provide clues about congenital adrenal hyperplasia) should be performed.  Much to-do is made of \"cysts\" on the ovaries, which are usually nothing more than the \"follicles\" that produce eggs (although, as Rntdj notes, there are exceptions to this rule).  In extreme case of PCOS, numerous follicles form but do never rupture to release an egg, because of  secondary abnormalities that develop in the hormonal control of ovulation.  Surgeons noted these abnormal follicles, biopsied them (because that is what surgeons do), and accidentally treated the abnormal production of androgens by reducing the amount of ovarian tissue that was producing them.  To this day, many people mistakenly believe that \"cysts\" (follicles) on the ovaries are the cause, rather than the result.   We now know better, but, until we can agree upon a better name, the condition is officially known as \"PCOS\" (which no longer stands for \"polycytic ovarian syndrome\" or anything else).  Unless the follicles are causing you symptoms (such as pain), it is pointless to \"treat\" them!   Unless  the underlying cause of excess androgens is treated, of course they will come back after their removal.  By far, the most common cause of excess androgens in women is insulin resistance, requiring the body to produce high levels of insulin to keep the blood sugar normal.  Not only does this increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and other features of the \"insulin resistance syndrome,\" but it stimulates the ovaries to produce androgens.  Diet and exercise are usually recommended to lose weight and reduce insulin resistance; while I wholeheartedly recommend these for HEALTH, I hope that I will not offend you when I say that  their long-term results in clinical practice for treating DISEASE are little better than a placebo.   Metformin is the standard treatment, because it does not cause weight gain and can be safely used during pregancy (Because it reduces the high rate of spontaneous abortions in PCOS pregancies, it SHOULD be used during pregnancy.)  Thiazoladinediones (the \"TZD's\" pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are also effective, but may cause unacceptable weight gain in about 5% of users, occasionally cause edema,  and should not be used during pregancy or attempted pregancy.  Most, but by no means all, women with PCOS are overweight, or at least carry their weight in their abdomins.  If your weight qualifies, weight-reducing drugs (orlistat, sibutramine, topiramate) are a consideration, but they should not be used during pregancy or attempted pregancy (Bariatric surgery for weight loss should be a last resort, after a thorough endocirne and metabolic evaluation, maximal lifestyle intervention, and failure of pharmacologic alternatives.  The popular bariatric surgeries all cause malabsorption with severe long-term consequences, and gastric bypass surgery with Roux-en-Y has been associated with a high risk of complicated pregnacies.  Laparoscopic adjustable vertically banded gastroplasty is an emerging alternative with a long-term weight loss at least as good gastric bypass with Roux-en-Y, but without the malabsorption and the high rates of surgical morbidity and mortality;  I am not able to comment on pregnancy after this procedure, however.).  Insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1) can mimic the effects of insulin on the ovaries, and I have seen one case where an extreme elevation due to acromegaly was the cause of PCOS (This is rare, with only about six cases described in the literature.).  It would be very unusual for PCOS to cause total testosterone levels of 400 ng/dl, however.  The second most common cause of excess androgens in women is congenital adrenal hyperplasia.  DHEA-S is only produced by the adrenal glands (although it can be produced by adrenal conversion of DHEA from other sources), so an elevation in DHEA-S can be a clue that the adrenal glands are the source of the excess androgens.  Despite its name, the adrenal glands are usually not enlarged.  A genetic deficiency in the enzymes required for the adrenal glands to produce cortisol (an essential hormone) causes the body to make more of the \"ingredients\" (precursors) from which cortisol is formed, so that the enzymes that are available will work more efficiently to produce cortisol.   Unfortunately, these \"ingredients\" are also used by other enzymes that produce androgens.  By far the most common type of enzyme deficiency producing this condition results in a build-up of 17-OH-progesterone.  Cosyntropin is a synthetic hormone that allows a sort of \"stress test\" of your adrenal glands' ability to produce cortisol to be performed.  Giving cosyntropin will cause the body to try to make more cortisol.  If it cannot, 17-OH-progesterone levels will rise dramatically.  in the past, congenital adrenal hyperplasia was treated with low doses of dexamethasone (a cortisol-like drug), but except for the \"classical\" forms that show up in early childhood, this is now generally reserved for women who are attempting to become pregant (to improve fertility) or are pregant (to avoid excess androgen exposure to the fetus--particularly undesireable for a female fetus!).  Rare causes of excess androgens include masses on the ovaires or adrenal glands, teratomas (which are sometimes located on the ovaries), and carcinoid syndrome.  Use of progestins (synthetic substitutes for the hormone progesterone) that have androgen activity (as contraceptives or to \"bring on\" the menstrual period) are often overlooked.  \"Dietary supplements\" of DHEA, DHEA-S, or androstenedione (\"andro\"), herbal remedies that are adulterated or mislabeled with these compounds, and misuse of androgens (by female atheletes or women desiring to become \"buff\") are other causes that are easily overlooked.  From what you describe, an ovarian mass (which can be the source of androgens) has been excluded, but your physician should at least think about the other conditions.  I hope that this information has been helpful to you.  Sincerely  Dr. Shank\n\n",

    "title": "Hashimotos Thyroiditis-strange symptoms with meds",
    "content": "I have been diagnosed with Hashimotos Thyroiditis, mulitnodule goiter.   I have been taking levoxyl 75mcg for more than a month and have been experiencing new symptoms.  The nodules in my neck have gotten and bigger and I have discovered a \"lump\" on my esophagus (up where the little hole is).  I also have what feels like swelling in  my hands and feet (though not severe),  Aching neck, back and shoulders and  Swollen lymph nodes that are painful and stay for days at a time.   I thought the meds were supposed to make the nodules smaller or at least stop them from getting bigger. I think I have gained a few lbs on top of that. My question is should I call my Doctor about my new symptoms? I don't have an appt til Sept, I am worried about these new sysmptoms but at the same time don't want to sound like a loon calling before my next appt. I am a singer and fear that I will lose my voice if I am not careful. I am also looking for others who might have experienced the same disease and could offer support. Thanks for your replies.\n\n",

Usually, the basic cortisone blood test is not used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency and you have to be subjected to a stimulation test where you are given a certain hormone and then the response of your adrenal gland is measured and if does not reach a certain value then you have adrenal insufficiency. This is called the Acth stimulation test.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and waiting for your questions.

    "title": "Question for Dr. Mokhtar",
    "content": "You had mentioned that the ACTH is used to stimulate the adrenals and then the cortisol levels are checked to see if they increase.  First, could you tell me if the ACTH is ever used to see if any of the enzymes used by the adrenals increases and if so, would this mean that the adrenals as a whole are fine and cortisol levels don't have to be checked?  Second, how much of an increase of cortisol would there have to be for the adrenals to be considered fine?  I had my 17 OHProgest checked before and after the administering of ACTH to see if there was a chance for LOCAH, but never had my cortisol level checked after the administration of the ACTH.  As for the 17 OHProgest, there was a substantial increase...nearly doubled after 30 minutes post ACTH administration.  What if someone's cortisol levels respond nicely to ACTH administration, but their baseline cortisol levels are normally \"low normal\" whereas their symptoms are consistant with low levels and perhaps there is a hypothalamus problem going on?  What can be done to determine that?  (I'm not sure if I asked this precise question in my other recent post.)  It's just that there has got to be a way to determine if there is a hypothalamus problem despite the fact that a person's numbers are still within range.  10  in a range of 5 to 23 might be normal for some folks, but perhaps it is not MY normal.  I want to determine if the 10 in the normal range that I have is perhaps not my normal...mine might be 15 or 20.  Fluctuations as an explanation for my lowering cortisol results over time just doesn't cut it to me because they never seem to show a upward fluctuation........hmmmm and then there is that little matter of my having experienced extreme stress over many years and being symptomatic.  Thanks, Marsha\n\n",

I keep reading about testosterone, how its a big factor in making gains, i've been working out on and off for a while now, taking protien etc, and see little gains in weight.  I'm wondering if my testosterone is low.  I don't know if this has any effect on it, but i was sort of a late bloomer i suppose, not really hitting puberty until i was around 17-18.  I've read somewhere that, that is because i have low testosterone...?  I was thinking of taking a testosterone supplement to get my levels higher, but then I read about all of the side effects of having too high testosterone.  I was trying to find information on how to boost levels naturally, by diet...etc, but wasn't totally successful.  About the supplements, I was going to try it for a month, and see what happened, I don't think i would get any side effects from that amount of time, but i'm not sure.  I was also wondering if sexual activity has any effect on the loss of testosterone....  Sex at least once a day...?  I think thats all i have for now...  Thanks.\n\n",

This doesn't mean your standard 2500 cals per day that you see as your average diet. Everyone is different and you may just need more food. I eat about 3000 cals per day, and that's too lose weight. Keep your carbs for pre-workout meals and one post workout. Then eat protiens and fats. Not getting enough fat in your diet can also cause low testosterone.  Any natural boosters are a waste of money. I did hear that sunbathing your \"sack\" can raise the levels, but I haven't tried it.  Most people who complain about not making gains in the gym either don't have a proper diet or don't have a proper routine. Just keep in mind that there are several people out there with low testosterone levels (Women, or casterated men) who still make great gains.\n\n",

    "content": "I, too, have had complications with the birth control patch and weight gain, with some differences. First of all, I went off the patch in December 2004. Since then (today, July 25, 2005), I have gained 25 lbs. I went from a slender 140 lbs (at 5'10\") and now weigh 165 lbs (which is still considered normal, but is not my normal weight). I exercise 5-6 times/week, run 30 minutes daily, strength train, and I am eating less and less. I eat no white sugar or flour, don't drink alcohol or soda, and eat 5-6 servings of fruit and vegetables a day with little results. My weight is centered entirely in my stomach, buttocks, and thighs. I am tired a lot, my sexual libido has decreased, and for the first time in my life, I have random, intense weight gain. I have a girlfriend who said the exact same thing happened to her and that her friend (an M.D. in NYC) said the patch had probably messed with her thyroid. So, I went to the doctor last week and she did some bloodwork, testing for thyroid, testosterone levels, estrogen levels, etc. I am still waiting for the results and I am worried that my doctor will find my test results to be normal. What then? Am I to assume my body will regulate itself? Am I to attempt some crazy diet or try supplements I have seen on the web? I am truly at my wits end and  I wonder how many women out there are experiencing similar reactions?? Thank you, thank you to each and all! Nico\n\n",

BTW: I am 42 and have a past medical history of COPD, hypertension, gastritis, and esphagitis.  My father also has low sodium but I am unsure of his history or workup on this.  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   Alcohol isn\u2019t good for hypothyroidism patients, carbohydrates and sugars aren\u2019t either. If you can get pamphlets from the doctor you will find some wonderful information along with diets, exercise programs, websites and Q&A sections.   A diet that includes foods that enhance thyroid function, such as whole grains, raw seeds, prunes, apricots, potatoes, dates, apricots, egg yolks, molasses and parsley. Limit consumption of alcohol, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, kale, mustard greens, peaches, pears, radishes, spinach and turnips because these foods suppress thyroid function. Avoid processed and refined foods, like white flour and sugar.  Things to help ease the symptoms of hypothyroidism such as:  DRY SKIN - put lotion in the shower and put it on while you are still wet after the  water        is off, rub it all over your wet skin and than pat dry.   HAIR LOSS \u2013 massage your scalp and use good hair products, take care of the hair you      have.   FATIGUE & WEAKNESS \u2013 don\u2019t think you need to be wonder person, relax, allow      yourself to rest. Don\u2019t get into the vicious circle of becoming worn down, you can\u2019t      get out of it very easily so just avoid it all together if possible.  CONSTIPATION \u2013 oatmeal mixed with whole flax seed, fresh vegetables, lots of fluids,       good diet will help here. Allow yourself time to just sit and relax in the restroom. Take        a book in there you like and don\u2019t bring it out, leave it in there for \u201cthat special time\u201d.       Don\u2019t rush yourself, this is an important part of body function that we don\u2019t give            enough time to.  EXERCISE \u2013 is so extremely important, walk around the local mall, weave the food isles,        walk the neighborhood, join the gym, swim, there are so many things that are fun but        still count as the \u201cE\u201d word. PLUS, exercise helps immensely with depression, it\u2019s       incredible how well an exercise program can help someone who suffers with       depression.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been having many unusual problems which seem to have a connection to hormones. They are most often much worse in the evening and night. The only explanation I have found that comes close to what I am experiencing is an endocrine myopathy of some sort. one of the problems i am having is producing breast milk at night. my GYN did a prolactin test in the morning and said it was fine so i cannot be producing milk. But I most definitely am. I am wondering if there is another hormone that might be responsible for producing milk, or if hormone levels flucuate during the day.  i am also getting muscle spasms,  tetany, tingling in my whole body, and my blood pressure fluctuates dramtically. This all happens at the same time as the milk production. Would it make sense to see an endocrinologist? And if so, if there are blood tests, should I take them when I am at my worst? Thank you very much for your time. It is greatly apreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "The symptoms that you are describing seem to be of hypercalcemia i.e increased calcium in the body.. this would explian the tetany, muscle spasms etc. One of the conditions that can cause this is Hyperparathyroidism .. which is what happens when the parathyroid gland starts overfunctioning.. also this can happen as a disease of the gland itself or of the pituitary.. which is the \"master gland\" that also produces prolactin... i think with the limited information you provided and without examining you it is at this point reasonable that you see either your primary care provider (who wouldve known you for several years) or see an endocrinologist... in any case further workup is warranted. hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello I have a few questions in  regards to my health problems.. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism roughly 8 months ago in the that time frame I have tried several thyroid medications and all of them seem to have made me worse instead of better...I have tried synthroid, levoxyl, levothroid, and nature throid.Currently I am on 30 mg of nature throid which has made my anxiety and panic attacks worse so thus my dr is in the process of swapping me back to levoxyl. My question is do you think i could  possibly be suffering from adrenal problems? Since the thyroid meds are  making me worse or is this just my anxiety playing a role on me? I had a cortisol test done I will give you my results and maybe you can give me your opinion..  One thing I forgot to mention was the morning i was going for my cortisol test i took a xanax so im not for sure if it altered my test results are not.... Here it is.......8:30 Am 15.5 ...ranges 5 - 25 /  3:30 pm 14.7  ranges 2.5 - 12.5 Also when treating the thyroid  about how long does it take for you to feel better or does it really depend on the person? Thank you for your time...\n\n",

If they take a does equivalent to a female, they will grow breast tissue.  Not only would it not work, there isn't a doctor in the universe that would do that.  It would be dangerous.

There isn't one post on this forum any more or less important than another and are answered to the best of everyones ability. There are many posts to answer and only a few people willing to volunteer their time in doing so. With that being said, let's get to your problem. I am unable to locate your original post concerning the lump in your throat. Some things that give this sensation are during periods of stress and anxiety, muscle spasms cause this sensation. GERD is another condition that may cause a sensation of a lump feeling or food feeling like it is lodged. Are you having any other symptoms aside from the feeling of a lump in the throat? It is quite wise of you to have an evaluation to identify the underlying disorder. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

When you say \"hard\" lump, hard as like a rock or firm and rubbery? Since it feels like it moves around and is not firmly fixed, keep in mind this is encouraging..... I would certainly suggest that on your doctor's visit, labwork (specifically thyroid studies), electrolytes which should include a calcium level and an ultrasound, thyroid scan or CT scan to evaluate the anomaly.

    "content": "When I was eleven(I'm 21 now) I noticed a large lump on my neck one night that hadn't been there before. I was taken to the doctor the next day, and was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. I was put on synthroid and I took that for the next 5 years. When I was 15/16 I stoped taking the meds, a few years later I got sick and went to a clinic, They insisted on checking my hormone levels because I still have a rather large goiter. The tests came back compleatly normal it confused me but I went on with life. Again a few years after that I went to the doctor for strep and they insisted on checking my hormone levals, they came back normal. Then two years ago I went to my doctor because I had my period for 2 mos strate he check my hormone levals again and they came back normal. I still have several symtoms of the disease ie: brittle hair and nails, intollerance to cold, iregular periods, mild depesion, tiredness, and the goiter. I read somewhere that you can go into remission from Thyroiditis? If that is true and I have why do I still have all of these symtoms? Why are all of the doctors I have seen cofussed by this? I haven't been to a specialist in quit a while and I've had a laps in insurance coverage so it probably wouldn't be covered. I don't know what to do, I'm tired of having doctors say \"that's odd\" when refering to me. Can someone please give me some info on this so I'm not compleatly in the dark. Thank you -Jen\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  I was diagnosed in 2003 with Hashimoto's disease.  I initially went to the doctor with many symptoms of hypothroid, and she ordered a TSH expecting to confirm that.  The result came back 0.015 TSH, and she had the lab re-check, with the same result.   She immediately referred me to an endocrinologist, who did more tests.  TSH came back 0.20, Free T4 1.05, Total T3 1.1, TBG 20, and ATA 125.06 with ATG 292.84.    This makes no sense to me.  How can my TSH be practically not there, and have such low Total T3?  Based on the antibodies, he diagnosed me with Hashimoto's.  I was unhappy with his treatment suggestions, and my lack of ability to communicate with him, so I declined his suggestions.   I returned to my primary care physician, and she ordered another round of thyroid tests.  By this time 8 weeks had passed since the endocrinologists diagnosis of Hashimoto.  I had been on no medication.  This time:  TSH 26.031, Free T4 0.50, T3 99.  I had now swung to firmly hypothyroid in 8 weeks time.  In light of the wildly varying test results, she suggested we wait another 8 weeks and then repeat the panel.  Two months later, we repeated.  This time:  TSH 0.32, Free T4 0.97, T3 uptake 30.  Another complete turnaround.  During this 5 month time period, I was consistently experiencing symptoms of hypothyroidism.  I requested treatment for hypothyroid which was refused, as my blood tests indicated hyperthyroid!  I sought treatment elsewhere.  I found a naturopath who agreed to prescribe me a trial of Armour Thyroid, which appeared to improve my symptoms.  However, before we could run more blood tests, I ended up moving, and it's now been just about a year since I've been on medication, and a little over a year since my last bloodwork.  I have consistently been experiencing many hypothyroid symptoms, and will soon be having a tubal reversal.  I know that I need to resolve these thyroid issues before I become pregnant.  I intend to find a doctor in the Reno area within the next couple of weeks, and begin testing and treatment again, but I am still so confused by the pendulum action with my TSH and other thyroid bloodwork.  Can anyone help explain this to me??  --Tracey R.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello mousebandit Please have a look at our Hashimoto's thyroiditis page You will notice that there may be a period of hyperthyroidism associated with the early phase of this disease.   The disease is characterized by destruction of the thyroid cells by various cell- and antibody-mediated immune processes. Antibodies binding to and blocking the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor have also been described and may contribute to further impairment in thyroid function. The result is inadequate thyroid hormone production and secretion, although, initially, both preformed thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) may \"leak\" into the circulation from damaged cells.  The presence of anti-TPO and anti-Tg deliniates the diagnosis. Please consult an endocrinologist as soon as possible in order to start taking the proper medication.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I am not sure of the appropriate place to post this to get a good response. I am a 25-year-old female, and I have a problem.  I started having a problem with my stomach hurting badly every time I ate in 1998. This has not yet been solved. Since that time, my weight has skyrocketed; I am heavier than I have ever been. I am 5\u20192\u201d and weigh 207. I was \u201cdiagnosed\u201d with lactose intolerance. For a year I changed my diet to rid myself of all dairy products, even including beets, peas, and beef, which although only have a miniscule amount of lactose, still seemed to bother my stomach. I lost then regained 30 pounds, and kept gaining in this year. I started having migraines in this same year, which weren\u2019t diagnosed until 2002. The stomach pain gradually increased even with this lactose-free diet. I started having horrible menstrual cramps and irregular bleeding, and have been living with my husband for over 5 years with NO birth control, and have never gotten pregnant. I went to an OB who diagnosed me with polycystic ovarian syndrome, and basically shook my hand and told me to lose some weight. That same OB office did a breast exam and told me that my breasts were filled with cysts but there were no lumps, then proceeded to ignore it and test nothing, which not only worried and scared me but made me angry because they gave me no answers to that.  This year, I finally whined enough to my family doctor to get sent to a gastroenterologist <I think\u2026. A GI Doctor>. He ran a lot of tests and told me that the stomach pain is Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and that I have gallstones but since that isn\u2019t where my pain is that I shouldn\u2019t worry about it. I am VERY frustrated, and would like a fresh opinion from someone with a clear slate to look at the whole picture. My main concern at this point is that while my doctors have come up with all these diagnoses, no one os doing anything to help me solve the problem. I understand that these are syndromes, and cant be \u201ccured\u201d, but I need some help relieving the symptoms, and losing weight, and I would like to be able to get pregnant and have children. My OB told me to get pregnant I need to lose weight, but from everything I have read about PCOS it causes weight gain? I have been on a very restricted lactose free diet, and the stomach pain doesn\u2019t go away, and the GI gave me a med for the pain that contains 25% lactose. These pills make the pain way worse than it is if I just plain out drink a glass of 2 % milk.   I guess I am trying to ask, is there anything else that could be causing all these symptoms as a whole picture? And with these things in mind can anyone suggest a good way to lose weight? I am dairy free, and also a vegetarian, except for tuna fish. I do swim and hike regularly, and have tested normal on my blood sugar and thyroid. I\u2019m just very frustrated and would appreciate any input, ideas, suggestions, or anything anyone has to offer! Thanks so much!\n\n",

    "content": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) causes irregular or absent menstrual cycles with evidence of excess male hormones causing facial hair growth, acne and hair thinning. It causing most women to become overweight and effect the egg production in the ovaries. It also causes skin tags and darkened pigment spots. The underlying cause of PCOS is an imbalance of hormones. A hormone you should have checked is insulin. Insulin problems can increase male hormone production by the ovaries. PCOS causes cholesterol levels to be higher putting woman at higher risk of heart disease so have that checked, also have your Thyroid checked, actually, a full bloodwork-up would be a good start if you haven\u2019t had that done yet.   What I would recommend is finding an Endocrinologist and go from there. Endocrinologists deal with all the glands that help maintain and control the body\u2019s energy levels, reproduction, growth, development, internal balance, response to stress and injury, hormones, etc. You may even find out what is causing your lactose intolerance, you may have a hiatal hernia or something, have you been checked for that?\n\n",

    "content": "I was just recently diagnosed hypothyroid in the early stages of hashimotos, so I haven't started taking the meds yet, but for the past month I have been waking up with severe joint pain in my fingers and balls of my feet. Sometimes the pain goes away and sometimes it doesn't.  I was afraid I was developing arthritus which I really don't want at the age of 23. I asked my doctor if this could be related to my hypothyroisism, but he didn't seem to really know.  I looked on the internet and there are resources that seem to \"kind of\" say that they are related, but nothing too trust worthy. I just want to know if hypothyroidism does cause the kind of joint pain I described, and if it could potentially go away when I start taking my thyroid pills. Thankyou.\n\n",

    "content": "Hypothyroidism increases anxiety and mood changes plus your coming off of methadone will bother your mood and anxiety level. Methadone hydrochloride is a synthetic opioid analgesic similar to morphine and because of its nature as your body withdraws off of it you will feel anxiety and mood changes so you have these feelings coming from both directions.  Synthroid is a synthetic thyroid hormone that is given when your body doesn't make enough thyroid hormone for whatever reason. Synthroid should be taken as directed by your Physician, at the same time each day and preferably on an empty stomach  unless you are instructed otherwise.   On the other hand, if your Synthroid dose is to high you may feel abdominal cramps, anxiety, diarrhea, fatigue, fever, hair loss, headache, hyperactivity, increased heart rate, irregular heartbeats, nausea, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, weight loss, vomiting - to name a few. TELL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY if you don't feel right, don't just stop your medication without direction.  Blood work should be done periodically by your Physician to check your thyroid levels, this will keep everything in order. I hope I've gotten close to answering your question.\n\n",

Disruptions in this particular electrolyte may cause severe consequences. An imbalance either way (too high or low) may cause excessive thirst, as for the salty taste I personally haven't encountered this particular complaint. Fluid restrictions and increases in dietary sodium is one way to correct mild hyponatremia. However, since you have went from essentially one extreme to the other I would suggest you have the levels rechecked. Once regulated it would be very unwise of you to go back to drinking gallons of water and restricting dietary sodium. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "Update on hyponytremia",
    "content": "Thanks for the reply. I know the hypernytremia could have been serious had it progressed and do have an appointment for followup with my primary care physician this week. My problem is that about ten years ago I was diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder and spent a lot of time in the state psychiatric hospital and ever since, my doctor has attributed any physical symptoms I have presented with to my mind. I saw him two days before ths ER visit with the beginning of the sypmtoms that sent me to the ER and he blamed it on anxiety and prescribed a whopping dose of Klonopin. I checked it out with my psychiatrist before filling the RX and she told me in her opinion this was not anxiety and directed me not to take the Klonopin which was triple the dose she had me on. So I made an appointment for a second opinion, but had to go to the ER before it was scheduled. Even the ER personnel thought that the hypernytremia might have been related to my psych meds(Seroquel, Lexapro, Klonopin). I get so disgusted with the bias against the mentally ill in this society. Just because at one point in my life I was psychotic doesn't mean that I won't ever have a physical illness. Maybe its time for a new primary care doctor. I was thirsty again today, but the salty taste has abated. Instead of water I drank some Diet Coke. I know it's basically a chemical cocktail, but according to the label it had some sodium and potassium in it, so I figured it was better than straight water. I still am very thirsty though.

    "content": "About 1 year ago my father-in-law woke up and couldn't stand up.   Both his feet were swollen, red and he had intense pain, he couldn't stand or walk.  The swelling and redness advanced up his calves.   His doctor tested him for lyme disease, which was negative, then sent him to a rhuematologist who put him on steriods.   The problem is still not solved.  They don't know what is wrong with him and his doctor says he will just have to live with it, which would be fine if he knew what \" with it\" was.    He has asked his physician if he should see a vascular specialist since it feels like his feet and legs are on fire and when he stands it is like there are needles sticking him.  The Dr told him he doesn't have a vascular problem.  He wants to go see someone, he is at his wits end, he just wants some sort of answer as to what is wrong.    Although I am not a physician I  have worked in the medical field for over 20 years it seems to me that seeing a vascular specialist might be what he needs to do.   With his feet and legs inflammed and painful it I'm concerned that he could have periphiral vascular disease of vasculitis.   He has emphysema so perhaps he is not getting the circulation that he needs.     We don't know where to turn.  marski\n\n",

    "content": "Hi marski, I have a some questions for you. Is your father a diabetic? Were there any vascular studies done to rule out venous insufficiency? Was an ultrasound performed to rule out any disorders such as a blood clot? Labwork anything? (By the way these tests can be ordered by a General Practitioner/ Family Physician) Certain medications cause swelling, as well as heart, liver and kidney conditions among a slue of other things. When I think of peripheral vascular disease, I think of cool, pale, extremeties. Pain, tingling or numbness may also present as symptoms. In my opinion he shouldn't have \"to live with it\" and not know what \"it\" is. I would suggest not asking \"should I be referred to a cardiologist\" I would say I want a referral to a cardiologist or to a physician whom is going to take the time to evaluate and at least suggest what the problem could be and not just say your going to have to live with it. I would consider that to be an infrequent response of a physician and I'm sure that you will find that it isn't the general norm. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Very occassionally (maybe once a year, if that often) I feel awful and slightly like I have a fever, but my temperature turns out to be low. If we are considering a fever begins at 100 degrees F and 98.6 is normal, this is a 1.4 degree change; I will often have a temperature below 98.6 at more than a 1.4 degree change (97.2)normally in the 96.5-96.8 degree range.  I am using a digital thermometer under the tongue for these readings. I have a normal temperature range when I do not feel sick. My father (56) also gets this on occassion. I do not have chills but I will feel uncomfortable and flushed, often have a headache, and feel lethargic and just not right.   Do you have any suggestions as to what this might be?  Thank you!\n\n",

    "title": "Docs won't listen to family history!",
    "content": "I'm looking for some advice before I go to yet another doctor.  I have always exhibited the symptoms of an underactive thyroid, which runs in my family. I've decided to seek help because my weight is increasing more quickly lately. I have not changed my pattern of diet and exercise recently. I normally get the recommended amount of exercise and do not overeat, but I have ALWAYS been \"stocky\" and found it hard to lose weight, in addition to being depressed, tired, and almost all the other things which go along with hypothyroidism.   I take the Depo-Provera injection, which in some cases causes gradual weight gain, but my recent weight gain is NOT normal and I know it! I would estimate that I have gained 20 lbs in about 4 months with no negative lifestyle change. I am alarmed, and so have gone to see a general practitioner. I explained my family's hereditary conditions which include the thyroid problem and type-2 diabetes. The doctor didn't seem to take me seriously, telling me that if I were a diabetic risk I'd be UNDERweight. My two diabetic great-aunts were fat! The doc sent me for generalized bloodwork. My blood sugar came up normal at the time and the thyroid test was just insde the normal range--no one explained the tests, I just got a paper in the mail with the results, a bunch of numbers I didn't understand.  This is not in my head, I am not the type to run to doctors for every little thing. In fact, I rarely go when I probably should!! I know something is not right. What should I do now? Ask for another test? See an endocrinologist? See another general practitioner and wait for a referral? I'm so lost and I can't imagine gaining another 20 lbs. I'm only 5-foot-two!! Any advice you have will be so appreciated!!\n\n",

    "title": "Hypothyroidism or ??",
    "content": "This could be rather long.  Sorry. For the last few years, actually since my last daughter was born I have had many strange s/s. It began when I was in nursing school. I would have \"near fainting\" spells. I would feel as if things were going \"numb\" or \"black\" beginning at my head and moving downward, while feeling very dizzy. This came and went but was not enough to worry me very much. This has been app. 7 years ago. Since then things have gotten more strange, at work I have these feelings as if I'm thinking in a \"fog\" and can't focus clearly. I have not had a FSBS greater than 80 in the last three years, although when I was pregnant I was diagnosed as \"borderline\" (190) gest. diabetic. I had also began to have something which felt like a lump in my throat. It usually comes and goes every month or so, each time it has gotten worse. The last time which was a couple weeks ago was making me feel as though I could hardly breath at night nor swallow. The foggy feelings have also gotten worse. The \"lump\" (again) has gone just as quickly as it started. The foggy feelings do not change. My FSBS has also gotten as low as 45 non-fasting. I had employee labs done in July and they scared me, not enough to go to MD though. I fear that I may be considered hypochondriac. My K+ was 2.9, CA+ 7.5, CL low, NA+ 114 etc. In January, actually last week I had them redone along with a TSH, most of my labs were back to normal range, except now my chol. which has never been high was 201 (has never been more than 160's. The TSH was 2.68. I just feel as though I'm living in a daze, which has never been normal for me. Even my husband thinks I may be a little \"nutty\" d/t the c/o all the time. Believe me I never go to the MD unless it's urgent. I do a lot of nurses self diagnosis. =)  I need just a small amount of input, other than \"See your Doctor.\" Any help appreciated, Angela B.\n\n",

    "content": "Some people with a TSH value over 2.5 mIU/L who have no signs (that is, no other abnormal thyroid function tests) or symptoms suggestive of an under-active thyroid may develop hypothyroidism sometime in the future. Anyone with a TSH above 2.5 mIU/L, therefore, should be followed very closely by a doctor.  However, my personal opinion is that the main thing you should concentrate on is your low fasting blood sugar. This could be an insulinoma. The possiblility of increased insulin secretion should be ruled out by an endocrinologist. It would explain all your problems.  I am sorry but you will have to see a doctor. If you have been waiting for something urgent to see a doctor then this is it. I really should not have to explain this to you, being a health professional yourself.  Please let us know how things turn out.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: Gynecomastia would have to be diagnosed by a physician.  Basically if the breast tissue is very firm, slightly rounded and the nipple is of normal size for a man and you have been doing exercises specifically to increase muscle mass in the chest, then it probably is just that, muscle tissue. The breast tissue of gynecomastia is usually softer, much more rounded, and may have enlarged nipples. However proper diagnosis needs to be made by a physician.  Self-diagnosis and treatment is dangerous.  Nolvadex,  the drug you mentioned,   is a hormonal treatment that has both estrogenic and antiestrogenic properties. It is primarily used in the treatment of breast cancer and has been associated with increased risk of deep venous thrombosis, which can be life threatening.  If you are concerned about this, I suggest you seek the advice of your physician who would be able to diagnose you properly and make recommendations as to what treatment would be best in your case. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

I have a friend who has to take medication and when I was telling her I thought I had problems with my thyroid, she told me the medication was not expensive. Though I didn't think to ask what she pays. Normally a blood test isn't too costly and from my experience most places will allow you to pay it out if you need to. I recently had a test for my thyroid but haven't got the bill yet. I understand your concern for not having insurance, cause I'm in the same boat and desperately need to see a Dr. about problems I'm having. But in my experience, sometimes it's best to do what you can before it gets too bad and costs you more money than it has to.   Sorry I didn't have more exact info but hope this helps a little.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  My sister has had  problems with her thyroid, and her \"tests\" proved to be quite expensive, especially with one of the new ones that required some machine that evidently costs a lot.  One bonus here, though.  I don't know about where you live, but here in Orlando some of the hospitals have programs where they \"write off\" a certain amount of hospital/lab expenses each month and all you have to do is call them about it.  They also offer reduced fees at the county hospital for those who are not insured.  As for the meds themselves, if they are too expensive, I know from personal experience that you can contact the manufacturer of most drugs and qualify for reduced cost or even free meds.  All you have to do is answer a few questions and usually give them a copy of your last years tax return for proof of income.  I got 2 meds that cost over a thousand each month from Schering Pharmaceutical by doing this!  My cost --- zero.  And the income guidelines were very reasonable!  Good Luck! Teresa\n\n",

    "title": "Can you help me as to whether this is adrenal insufficiency?",
    "content": "Hello,  I am hoping I can get some advice.   I have been to many many different kinds of doctors and now I am so confused. One says this and the others say something else. I don't know which ones to believe.  I am almost 40 years old. Ever since I was 13 I get extremely exhausted everyday at the same time, worse if I have had a stressful day. I used to take a nap every day after school and then as the years past I took a nap every day after work (which was before 5 pm). But in the past 10 years I work past 5 pm and at 5 pm that is when the exhaustion hits me hard to where I need to sleep and if not I feel as if I am going to die.  So anyway, for the past 10 years I am unable to take a nap because of my work hours and by pushing myself beyond the 5 pm mark (when the exhaustion hits) I have developed fibromylgia (according to a fibro specialist -Dr Pellegrino).   I have been trying to find a reason why I get so darn exhausted after only being up for 8 hours. I have spent thousands of dollars and alot of time on this and I still don't have any real clue. I had a ACTH stim test done. Also a random cortisol test. So many other different tests also.  Here are my results from the random cortisol test at  6 pm. -- 5.5 (range 3-22 AM)                    (range 1-16.7 PM)  ACTH Stim test: 8 am. -- 16.6 (range 3.8-14.4) 1 hour later 20.3 (range 3.8-14.4) 1 hour later 24.2 (range 3.8-14.4)   Adreno. Hormone 8 am. -- 37 (range 7-10am: 9-52) 1 hour later 49 (same as above)  1 hour later 19 (same as above)  Saliva Cortisol: Morning -- 12.5 (range 13.0 -24.0) Noon -- 4.7 (range 5.0-7.0) Afternoon -- 2.1 (range 4.0-7.0) Nighttime -- 1.2 (range 1.0-3.0) Cortisol sum: 20.5 (range 23.0-42.0) DHEAs Average 1.3 (range 2.0-10.0)   I am current seeing a DO who is treating me for low ratio of Estradiol/Progesterone.  She says that my cortisol should rise once I am on this cream for awhile, well its been 4 months and I still don't feel any better.  I am also in alot of muscle pain in the neck and shoulders, I am constipated every day, maybe have a bowel movement once a week if I am lucky, blood shot eyes after being awake for 8 hours also very small pupils, poor concentration, foggy, foggy head and extremely exhausted.  I also am seeing a sleep specialist, I have sleep apnea and PLDM and am on 30mg of Remeron. I have been on this for about 2 months now and I am slighty better in the foggy head area but thats it.   Do you think my cortisol levels are ok? Or should I continue to find a doctor that will treat low cortisol?  Any advice would greatly be appreciated !!!  Thank you so much for listening!  Tired and worn out and about ready to give up at almost 40 years old!  Joyce\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Joyce,   the ratio of average cortisol to DHEA puts you in area 4, which according to DiagnosTechs scheme is adrenal maladaptation phase II.   Nutritional Protocols to deal with this would include (from Apex Energetics products):  Glysen to manage sugar metabolism, Adaptocrine, Adrenocalm, and  fatty acids such  as DHA, EPA and some GLA.   Standard Process has a slightly different protocol.   ASk your DO to contact Apex Energetics and ask for seminar info by Datis Kharrazian DC (and numerous other degrees) http://www.apexenergetics.com   rebuilding estrogen/progesterone will help, but the metabolic pathway goes farther back, to cholesterol and its derivatives, vital VITAL for building adrenal cortex substances such as cortisol, DHEA, and the sex hormones, also CoQ10.     Phosphatidyl serine is an important support ingredient here too.     meanwhile absolutely avoid anything with caffeine such as coffee, colas.   Serious B vitamin therapy, vita min C complex,  CoQ10 , and a completely clean diet  (recognizable as if it had come straight from the garden (OK to have washed it off), NOTHING from a cardboard or plastic container with ingredient lists on it.   You might try powdered green vegetables such as Perfect Food, Just Barley, Best of Greens,  small amounts 1/4 tsp twice a day to start, then increase the amount  sounds like a need also for balancing your amino acids, rebuilding nutrient supply on a grand scale.   again, LOTS of veggies, also some fish, NO fake food.    Swaroopa yoga and a SAD or full spectrum light might be helpful too.    Hope this helps,  Karen\n\n",

    "title": "Chronic Mystery Illness for over 14 years",
    "content": "Hello!  I'm seeking help in trying to find a connection between the chronic illnesses I have experienced over the past 14 years.  I am scheduled to see a metabolic specialist in 2-3 months and for the first time I am investigating my numerous conditions as the result of a single condition rather than just \"bad luck\".   It all started around 15-16 yrs. of age, with endometriosis - followed closely by irritable bowel syndrome, fibrocystic breasts, costchondritis, cfs, rapid tooth decay (would result in dentures by age 25), kidney stones, bladder infections, migraines and chronic headaches, mild conscious seizures (simple), low-grade fevers, mental problems, persistent lesions and skin infections, loss of appetite, perleche, sciatica and low back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and lots of small annoying symptoms along the way. My worst episode lasted about 3-4 years and then diminished somewhat, only to return in the past 2 years after the birth of my son & a hysterectomy following shortly after. Not only are all of these symptoms recurring with vengence, I can add the following to my growing list: hair loss in a diffuse pattern, chronic back and neck pain, vision problems (depsite normal eye exam), arthritis-like symptoms, shakiness, severe muscle fatigue. The list goes on, is growing and this is the worst I've had it. More strikingly is memory problems in the form of short-term memory loss and forgetting the names of objects. Unfortunately, I have not received proper medical investigation over the years due to living in a small town with limited resources and even worse - limited minds. The most I could get is general bloodwork (always \"good\") and a pat on the back. I'm likely missing a lot of extra symptoms - there are just too many to count.  I have a theory that my conditions all share the common thread of being inflammatory disorders. I do not wish to diagnose myself, but I feel that sometimes a patient has no other choice but to investigate for themselves when doctors fail to.   So I have a few questions I hope some kind doctor will answer: - What types of diseases or disorders are reflective of this kind of chronic inflammatory-type illnesses? - Do you think I'm on the right track by looking at the long-term conditions and symptoms as a whole, or is it indeed VERY possible that I just have \"bad luck\"? - Any other insight, advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your time!  C.\n\n",

It seems irresponsible for a doctor to say you have an autoimmune disease without: 1) identifying which one 2) not offering any relief and 3) telling you to live with it. No wonder you are discouraged. When a doctor belittles a patient's symptoms like this it is just cruel. I understand they can't allow themselves to feel any sort of empathy for patients, but geez... a little humanity wouldn't hurt.

    "content": "Hello, Your complaint is known as edema of the lower limbs. Like serenity22 suggested your body is not processing fluid properly. This could be the result of varicose veins or cardiac congestion, a decrease in albumen content of blood due to severe malnutrition or liver cirrhosis. Renal failure may also lead to lower limb edema. Some women have this condition as part of their premenstrual syndrome. Pregancy is another cause.  You should be evaluated by your physician as soon as possible.\n\n",

A typical textbook complication list of tonsillectomy is provided below:      * Hemorrhage (the most common complication)      * Intraoperative complications.      * Primary (occurs within first 24 hours)      * Secondary (occurs between 24 hours and 10 days)   Other complications include the following:      * Pain (eg, sore throat, otalgia)      * Dehydration (common in children who will not eat because of pain)      * Weight loss (common in children who will not eat because of pain)      * Fever (not common, usually related to local infection)      * Postoperative airway obstruction (because of uvular edema, hematoma, aspirated material)      * Pulmonary edema (occurs in people with true airway obstruction caused by tonsils)      * Local trauma to oral tissues      * Tonsillar remnants      * Voice changes (if tonsils are very large the voice may be muffled)      * Psychological trauma, night terrors, or depression      * Death (uncommon; usually related to bleeding or anesthetic complications)   Hope this helps.  bill\n\n",

I looked up homocystinuria on the internet to see what it was and how it affected me but it kept saying if you have one mutated gene than you are a carrier and if you have 2 than you have homocystinuria. but I don't have it so what does that mean? how can I have 2 mutated genes and not have homocystinuria?

Currently TSH is 1.55 which has been gradually dropping from 1.67 in Dec.  T3 Uptake has gone from 35.9 to 33.9  T4, Thyroxine was 8.9 then 8.0 and the last time they did a Free T4 (1.4) so couldn't compare.  All of these are in a fine range.

I was told that by lowering the Synthroid dose it would allow the TSH to increase.  However, another TSH test a few weeks later showed myy TSH was 1.57 with normal being 4.0 to 5.50.  It seems to me that my TSH has dropped instead of increasing.  Since the dosage was decreased, I have been gaining weight and my stomach and abdomen are bloated and firm to the touch.  My doctor doesn't seem to be concerned but I don't like feeling like my skin is too tight around the middle.

    "title": "Re: Thyroid tsh results",
    "content": "Dear Arcojank,  i could not agree more with Bill.  Still there are one or two more things.  You have mentioned two different tsh lab tests comparing them to each other. i know it is not your fault but i think you should have had the same test to be able to follow the results in a very objective manner. From 18 to 1.5 looks like it is surely going down but the scale was different from one test to the other so personally i don't know exactly what it means. By the way it takes about 6 weeks for the effect of the synthroid dose change to appear on the tsh level in your blood, so if you had the test before that, it might have not reflected the true effect.  tsh is secreted by the pituitary gland and is not only affected by the synthroid you are taking but is also affected by another organ called the hypothalamus that secretes another substance that controls the release of tsh.   i assume that the original cause of hypothyroidism in your case was a problem within the thyroid gland itself and there was nothing wrong with the pituitary or the hypothalamus. If something starts to go wrong with either of them then the tsh will be low all the time and even if you stop taking the synthroid altogether, your tsh will still come back low. This is not a common occurrence and when it happens the only way to know whether a patient is getting enough synthroid is to check their thyroid hormone level in the blood directly.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I had thyroidectomy almost 4 yrs ago now at age 35  I can honestly say I never found it too painful. I found it more frustrating than painful, as when you lay down, you are unable to move your neck freely.  My scar felt a little tight when healing, but that is all part of the healing process, and as a good surgeon will try to disguise the insicion in a neck crease, you scar will be almost invisible when healed fully.  I am in the Uk, and spent just 4 days in hospital, that was mainly due to the fact that I had to have daily calcium checks for a few days after surgery.  I would say you should ideally take at least 4 weeks off work. It takes a long while to rid your body of the effects of the anesthetic. Also depending on why your thyroid is being removed will affect how you may feel.  Good Luck hope all goes well.  ps I have never looked back since having mine removed. Scar is invisible now.

Testosterone deficiency may result from disease or damage to the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, or testicles that inhibits hormone secretion and testosterone production, and is also known as hypogonadism. Depending on age, insufficient testosterone production can lead to abnormalities in muscle and bone development, underdeveloped genitalia, and diminished virility.\n\n",

Are you having regular intercourse with your husband like every 2-3 days for at least a year and during the period during which you are supposed to be ovulating?  Infertility work-up starts with physical examination of the wife and husband both, then a semen analysis of the husband and then checking whether or not the wife is ovulating (and this is the step where hormone levels are checked in the blood) and making sure that the environment where the sperms travel to reach the ovum is not hostile.

    "content": "Hypothyroidism is virtually the only disease that raises TSH levels in a sustained fashion. As the TSH level increases, an increase in T4 conversion to T3 occurs; thus, T3 levels are maintained. In early hypothyroidism, TSH is increased, T4 is normal to low, and T3 is normal.  Achieving a TSH level within the reference range may be slowed because of delay of hypothalamopituitary axis readaptation. After dose stabilization, patients can be followed with annual clinical evaluations and TSH monitoring. Monitor patients for symptoms and signs of overtreatment, which include tachycardia, palpitations, nervousness, tiredness, headache, increased excitability, sleeplessness, tremors, and possible angina.   Hence you will rely more on your symptoms and your T3, T4 levels to reach a stable dosage. Then you will have to wait a bit for the TSH to normalize.  Regards,\n\n",

When i say my nipples are embarassing, it isn't the shape or anything, it's that recently since starting my oral contraceptives (just over 2 months ago) I have had quite a lot of discharge. I know that this is normal when hormone levels change, and it is milky white in colour, but I am finding it very difficult when I wake up in the middle of the night to find my pyjamas with wet patches around the breasts of even the sheets wet, as I am not used to this! I know that I am not pregnant, I am only 17 and have never had a child, therefore never breast fed before. I know it can also be through stimulation but that has not increased since before I started taking the pills. It is making me very self conscious, although during the day I can wear a bra which usually protects me as the discharge comes mostly after a warm bath or when my dressing gown has rubbed me, but sometimes i find drops without having to do anything. Please help me, I don't know what to do, and I can't enjoy myself or feel confident getting intimate with my boyfriend or anything at the moment. Yours hopefully, Bobydeex\n\n",

Since the amount of discharge seems excessive you should consult your doctor (the one that prescribed the contraceptives would be best). He may choose to switch you to a different pill but may also want to exclude other causes of galactorrhea depending on the clinical examination.  Regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Gynecomastia - embarassed",
    "content": "Hi.  I am 19 years old male. I was looking thru the web a while ago and i realised that i have a condition called Gynecomastia. It is, indeed, very embarassing.  My chest/breasts are big and im very embarassed and hence i only choose to wear looser and bigger shirts so as to hide my \"disablitity\". It is also embrassing to walk against the wind or run.  I have this condition since a very young age, and i reckon it is a genetic thing passed down from my mum's side of the family, of which a few of my cousins are suffering from the same condition.  Other possible causes of the condition might be that im asthmatic and had taken Ventolin and Volmax when i was young. Whether or not they contributed to the condition, i cant be sure.  I am 168cm in height and 78kgs in weight. I have just signed up for a gym-program which includes aerobics and other activities and I have decided to go on for 6 months. However, i just discovered Gynecomastia might not be cured by exercise and it led to me worrying that if my fat around my body is reduced, my \"breasts\" would become more apparent than ever.  I am so depressed right now. Could you tell me what are the things i could do to reduce Gynecomastia, apart from going under the knife (operation)?   Please reply as soon as possible. Thanks.  Embarassed85.\n\n",

So also in secondary hypothyroidism due to hypothalamus/pituitary dysfunction TSH assay is of little use, and remains low with free T4.  Thyroid uptake scans are not useful in hypothyroidism, and they only serve to assess the anatomy and function of the thyroid gland; and for the scan to provide us with information, the gland should have some level of functioning, which may not be there at all in cases of severe disease.

    "content": "Since I was about 5 years old, I've never faired well in hot temperatures and that's understatement.  I work in a field of law that requires me to rifle through tons of medical reports and recently came across a person being diagnosed as heat intolerant.  The medical did not elaborate as to what this was, but it sounds like a possible name for what I experience quite often.  When I get hot, my face turns bright red and feels like it's on fire.  Then I begin to sweat profusely (literally buckets).  After that, it progresses into a pounding headache that gets worse and worse.  Evetually, the headache becomes so bad that it's paralyzing.   Usually I will then end of vomiting or experience dry heaving.   It takes quite awhile for me to get back to normal.  This is usually brought on by hot temperatures and/or exercise.  Even temperatures that aren't hot for most will be incredibly uncomfortable for me.  I seriously dred summer.  Is this what heat intolerance is? And if it isn't, then what's wrong with me?  What can I do to stop this?  Sincerely,  Seriously Hot\n\n",

    "title": "Surgery questions concerning diabetes",
    "content": "I discovered yesterday that I will be having surgery soon.  They found a mass in my adrenal gland that is around 2\" in diameter.  My doctor says it has not invaded any other area.  I had an ultrasound, catscan, blood work, 24-hour urine, and an MRI.  The radiologist that read my tests said that the mass was suspicious looking.  I am scheduled for a biopsy of it to find out conclusively whether it is a benign tumor or cancer.  The surgeon will do an adrenalectomy (laparoscopic if it is benign tumor, actual cut if it is cancer), then he will take out my gall bladder.  After he is done, the gynecologist will come in to perform a complete hysterectomy on me.  My concerns that I am writing about deal with my diabetes.  I have been working very diligently to get my blood sugar readings under control.  I have lost 30 lbs. over the last five months by eating better and exercising each day.  My insulin intake has dropped a great deal, and my blood sugar readings have also improved.  I rarely have readings out of the normal range now.    How will all of this affect my diabetes and my blood sugar readings?  Will more medication be required?  Will my readings become elevated? I do not see an endocrinologist--would you recommend I involve one?  Any advice or information concerning my diabetes or the surgery would be much appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Surgery questions concerning diabetes",
    "content": "Dear Scholarshipmom57,  Thank you very much for using our website.  i am very pleased to see more people taking actions regarding their health, because it is their life.   i think that most probably your doctor explained to you that there are sometimes were adrenal gland masses are found incidently on ct scans and the significance of those is not really known and they are called incidentalomas. Usually, radiologists are very good at identifying these incidentalomas. Your doctors did things the right way and checked for activity of this tumour since it looked suspicious.   Diabetes and adrenal glands are a very tricky item.  First some tumours of the adrenal glands can cause diabetes by secreting some of the hormones.  If this tumour was secreting a hormone that was causing diabetes, once the tumour is out, diabetes should be cured, but from your story, i doubt that.  Surgeries are usually a stressful situation and during stresses, there are certain hormones that the body will secrete that will make your diabetes control difficult.   The adrenal glands secrete cortisol which causes high blood sugar as well. One of your adrenal glands is coming out, i am not sure about that but i think that the time that the other adrenal gland takes to compensate for the absence of the other adrenal gland is relatively short.   Cortisol is an essential hormone and i am not sure about the protocol that the endocrinologists use to replace the hormones of one adrenal gland because i have not been exposed to that many cases of removal of one adrenal gland only.  i think they supply you with steroids (which will make your diabetes control worse, but this will be treated by insulin) in the immediate post-operative period and do a certain test which will show whether your other adrenal gland is working adequatly or not. If it then there will be no need for steroid replacement, if it is not, then they will supply you with physiological doses of steroid which should not really affect your diabetes and even if it does, you will just have to increase your insulin.  In addition to the stress of surgery, you will not be doing your usual activities or eating as you are at home, so the control is going to be a day by day thing. And during your hospitalization you will be checked a lot for blood sugars because doctors are now very diligent about diabetes control as well.  Regarding your diabetes control after all the stress of surgery is gone, you are back to your base line activity level and eating habits at home, you will be able to control your blood sugars the way you are doing now.  i assume that the doctor that you are following with for your diabetes is an internal medicine doctor. Regarding involving an endocrinolgist in your care will most probably be up to the surgeons and your internal medicine doctor who will most probably be taking care of you during your hospitalization because of your diabetes. If your internal medicine doctor feels comfortable enough dealing with this type of situation, then there is no need for an endocrinologist, if he thinks it is going to be in your best interest to consult an endocrinologist, they will do it. It is also upto you if you want to consult an endocrinologist, you can ask your surgeons to involve one in your care. Personally, i think that an endocrinologist should be involved before the decision of taking out your adrenal gland is taken as endocrinologists usually have lots of experience with this type of tumours.  Good luck with your biopsy and keep us posted.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Trying to be helpful to a friend and I am running low on thoughts.  My Friend was tested twice both HBA1C test were elevated (7.1 once in October and now in March). The first his doctor thought was perhaps a false positive so he re-ran the test in March but the results stayed basically the same.  His Doctor on receiving the second elevated number then ran a fasting glucose test which produced a 79 result (good as I know it).  At this point my friend asked me what I thought.  My friend is an Afro-American male about 57.  His family has had a history of diabetes and I suppose why his Doctor ran the A1C before the Fasting Glucose Test.   1). My friend is not at all overweight(he is trim). 2). His Lipid panel is excellent in my opinion as of last Oct.  HDL(102) LDL(90) T(46).   3). Not hypertensive.   4). I looked over his CBC (again as of last Oct.) and all was alright (I was looking for anemic/low iron) but his numbers looked fine(least as far as a CBC goes).   5). His basic diet to me is fairly good.  Breakfast light mostly orange juice and unsweeten oatmeal, lunch a small salad, dinner mostly veg/some starchs and light on red/white meats and fish several times a week.  He drinks unsweeten coffee.  I should be so good. 6). He performs light exercise several times a week(4 days) for about 1/2 hour, his job is sedentary.  I then asked my friend to see if his Doctor would run a sickle cell test and do a glucose tolerance test.  My friends Doctor agreed and ran these two additional test.  I was surprised to hear from my friend  the glucose tolerance test report back normal (I don't have the specific numbers yet)  and no sickle cell.  To look at my friend I can see no signs of cushing.  I am running out of ideas to suggest and as of yet his Doctor has not ordered an additional test.  So what else to look for?    What is driving the A1C results up if all these other test show negative.  Would you possible think that he is off and on again producing insulin as needed?  Perhaps someother blood disorder?  What additional test/markers would you suggest.  I think that some of the test that were ran last October should be repeated now as well to get everything in sync.   I like a good puzzle, I am not in the medical field and have just about exhausted off the top what I can think of to add.  I am hoping his Doctor thinks of something and perhaps you can chime in a thought or two -  but if not  perhaps my friend should see and Endro whom I know and have alot of confidence in.  Any help would be  appreciated - thanks for sharing - a helpful puzzled person trying to be helpful to a friend.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Wizbanger,  The diagnosis of diabetes does not rely on a hba1c test results.  The diagnosis of diabetes is based on the results of either a high fasting blood sugar or a glucose tolerance test.   By definition of your friend's fasting blood sugar, your friend is not diabetic. As regards to the oral glucose tolerance test, if all the values were normal as well, your friend is not diabetic. There is a condition called pre-diabetes but it has a definition too according to the glucose tolerance test. If you friend does not fulfill the criteria these criteria, he does not have diabetes.   Now for this mildly elevated hba1c levels and the fear that there is hyperglycemia somewhere during the day that's not detected by the glucose tolerance test, there is a device now that can measure blood glucose level for 24 hours period but the person has to know how to count carbs and has to measure his blood sugar at least 4 times a day for calibration of the device and lots of other things. This is not an easy process and i am not sure that in your friend's case whether the insurance will pay for this device, it is usually used for diabetics who are very tough to control.   At any rate, the one thing that has been proven to prevent and/or delay diabetes is performing exercise, so this is the best thing that your friend can do.

I am still very thirsty and have to go the bathroom all the time I think I am losing weight too, is that cause I go the bathroom all the time? The thing that has me really concerned is the fact I am so tired, and that I think I am drinking enough to fix all that I have lost in fluids but I still get my heart racing and feel dizzy. One thing on the list is that I am definitely not pregnant.  Anyway the University Health Center opens on Wednesday (after the holidays) So I think I might go in then if anything else happens or it gets worse.

    "content": "Angie, this is how I think you should proceed. If possible you should go to the hospital immediately. If not then call 911.  If you can't then as soon as your roomate comes back have the test repeated and have her do it for you. Thats just to make sure that your reading is that high. It certainly matches your symptoms. If confirmed then you have a very high blood sugar level. Combined with your vomiting and your stomach pains then you are already starting to go into diabetic ketoacidosis. A very serious and very grave condition. You will need insulin and will need fluids until the situation is controlled. There is no way you can fix this alone. There is also no way you can leave this for later. Ketoacidosis progresses without insulin and you could enter a phase of coma. Do you know a nurse or does one of your friends have a relative that works in a medical facility in your area. They may be able to help. If not then it will be worth while to go to get it checked at the hospital.  yes its serious it shouldnt even wait till the morning!\n\n",

Then there were I.V.s, Blood samples, urine samples etc\u2026 and bags of what looked like water\u2026 They called it something like Normal Sal...I have no clue looked like water. Gave me some shots. The Doctor was also surprised that my breath didn\u2019t smell funny. (I don\u2019t know why he thought that was so important, but he changed his mind on what he thought the problem was.) He thought it was \u201cDiabetic Ketoacidosis\u201d but then said he thinks I might have a case of what\u2019s called \u201cHyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Nonketotic Coma\u201d. They are going to run tests I guess and call me about it later. He also thinks it is weird that I have it so young. Then he said that he thinks that I might be a little sick (like normal sick) on top of it (perhaps because of the weather out here) Anyway Got to come home for a little bit. I am going back there in a few hours, but he wants me to go to a different Doctor tomorrow, one that doesn\u2019t work at the ER in the hospital. But to come in if I feel at all sick. Is the second problem worse then the first? Am I then Diabetic. I didn\u2019t ask there cause I was to upset about the tests and all and wanted to come home as soon as it was fixed. They seem to think that it can\u2019t just be fixed like that though.  Angie\n\n",

    "content": "Angie, I am glad you went to the hospital. It was really dangerous going around like that on your own. I am not in a position to say if you have diabetic ketoacidosis or not. That was just a speculation based on some of your symptoms. It can easily be determined by the blood tests and /or urine tests they may have requested in the ER? Either way the shots you were given were probably insulin. This is something you need to have regulated.  Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency. The blood sugar goes high and the blood starts acidifying due to something called ketone bodies (molecules such as ketonic acid which are made by the body to compensate for the lack of energy accompanying diabetes). If your blood goes acidic thats very dangerous. This could lead to coma and could lead to death if left untreated.  You were wise to go to the ER this morning. Please go the doctor you were referred to tomorrow. He will know more about your condition and fix this thing for good.  Check our page about diabetes to learn more about it.  Click here!\n\n",

    "content": "Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Nonketotic Coma develops as a result of very high  blood glucose concentrations in blood. Dehydration resulting from  excessive fluid loss with very high blood glucose causes blood water levels to fall. This dramatically worsens the problem of high glucose, concentrating sugar more. In patients who develop HHNK insulin is produced in contrast to diabetic ketoacidosis in which no insulin is produced. So severe ketosis seen in DKA is prevented. Still, HHNK is life threatening and requires immediate medical attention. I agree totaly with the second doctor, I was rather surprised when they allowed you to go home the first time. They will invistigate your condition and will also exclude that there is a cause behind your diabetes (2ry diabetes). I know you must be worried but from now on since you are receiving medical attention it will be just a matter of time before everything is fixed.\n\n",

    "content": "memorylane4ever, J Thanks for your concern. Went to the doctor a little bit ago. I have Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Nonketotic Coma. From what I understand I can\u2019t go into DKA. My case is rather odd in the fact that it happened with iut me having a history of Diabetes and me being 19. However is not unheard of. For people in my case sugar can go quite high, higher then normally high and I still might not have signs of it till then because the body has enough insulin to not let the body make \u201cketones\u201d but not enough to get rid of all the sugar. Anyway I think this is right, I might be wrong since I am just learning about it.  If I am wrong I am sure on of the doctors on here will post a correction after me\u2026 Thanks for your concern Angie\n\n",

One of the most serious complications of diabetes is when you get a hypo. I am sure your doctor must have told you about that. Your blood sugar goes very low because the insulin dose is higher than is required for your blood sugar level (because you either didnt eat too well or you performed too much physical activity).  Ok we will make a deal! Call your doctor up and if he agrees ok!  He's probably the best person to judge since he can change your dose and diet to make it more agreeable with your trip. Not sure he'll be too happy about hearing it though.   Good regards.\n\n",

About scleroderma, it is an autoimmune disease, which so far, does not have a cure although there are new experimental medications that seem encouraging. My advice to you if scleroderma is a concern is to be seen by a rheumatologist to decide whether you have it or not because it can lead to lots of complications.   The shortness of breath that you feel on exertion could be related to lots of things, the simplest of which is you being physically unfit ending with having heart failure. You have to be seen by your physician and apropriate actions taken if deemed necessary (x-rays, referral to specialists, etc...)

    "title": "Is something wrong with me?  Please help!",
    "content": "I seem to have a lot of things wrong with me.  Maybe I am just paranoid.  I'm not sure. It takes a long time for me to get well when I get sick.  Like, three weeks for a cold.  I  get frequent urinary tract infections and frequent yeast infections.  Even when tests for utis come up normal I discomfort in that area.  I have seem to have excess vaginal discharge, though I have no basis to compare what is normal, so that may be nothing.  I generally feel like crap a lot of the time.  I have trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep.  The glands in my throat are swollen almost all the time, even when nothing else seems to be wrong and my throat is often a bit sore.  I catch a cold almost every other month.  My appetite is wierd, I often have no appetite at all, even when I haven't eaten all day (of course then there are days where I really pig out so maybe that's nothing).  I often get pains in my lower back on the right side and in my lower abdomen on the same side.  Could all of this be connected?  Could all this be because I am simply not taking good enough care of myself or could it be a sickness of some sort?  Please help!  I don't have good insurance and they will only pay if I have a good reason for going!\n\n",

I will be fine one minute and then next I will be in a rage.  My heart starts beating fast, stomach gets in knots, cold sweat, noises intensify etc.  Next, I can be fine again.  There doesn't seem to be anything in particular that sets me off so I don't think a therapist would do me any good.  Something that made me mad 5 minutes ago doesn't now and vice versa.  It seems to be happening alot more lately.  Today my stomach has been in knots all day and I feel alittle lightheaded, but nothing happened.  I do work in customer service, however it doesn't just happen when I get a mean customer and sometimes the mean customer doesn't even make me mad.  I really don't understand and it's really starting to bother me and my family.  I get snappy with my customers too and that is definately not good for my job.  My mother says that I should go to the doctor, but I don't want him/her to think I am overreacting or wanting attention etc.  I feel foolish about it and I know it's dumb, but it really is starting to have a big effect on my life.  I have tried the \"counting to 10\", St John's Wort etc but nothing seems to help. Any suggestions on an herb for this or is this something that I really should see a doctor about?  Could I possibly have some kind of hormone imbalance?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear angel, I think you should see a therapist. The mood swings may turn out to be a result of a recent change e.g. moving to a new house, new job.. etc.. It may also result from the exact opposite (a static life with many unfulfilled hopes). The fact that you have a sister with bipolar manic depression does increase your risk of mental disease by about 10%.  A hormonal imbalance would usually present with a lot of other problems besides mood swings. Even if at an early stage, hormonal imbalance would surely become evident sooner or later with more alarming symptoms which can them promptly be treated, so I would'nt worry about missing out on this diagnosis. Seeking the advice of a good psychiatrist is probably the best way to get better.  Best regards,\n\n",

I have my blood sugar tested every 6 months, and there have been numerous times that it was too high or too low so I had to go back the next day. Lately, I have noticed several changes in my health.  I have been incredibly hungry and have therefore eaten more.  I am even hungry as soon as I get done eating a large meal!  However, I have LOST weight.  Also my thirst has been insatiable and sometimes I feel like I have cotton in my mouth my mouth is so dry!  More drinking=more trips to the bathroom, of course.  Also my eyesight has definitely changed for the worst suddenly.   I am sooo sleepy all the time and the past few days I have missed several classes because I was just too exhausted to get out of bed, and have taken a nap in the afternoon. I checked my blood sugar yesterday using my mom's sugar-checker thing (sorry I don't know what it's called) and my sugar was 85, which is fine. I really think that I'm showing some major diabetes symptoms... but my sugar checked out fine. What could it be??  I'm getting really stressed about it! Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear nicamb,  You home random blood sugar test is not in the diabetic range. However, random blood sugar levels are not used to tell whether you have diabetes or not. Rather, the gold standard for diagnosing diabetes is an elevated fasting blood sugar level of 140 mg/dl or above on at least two occasions.  In addition, these devices are prone to some false results so if you want to rule out diabetes properly you should do so by going to the lab or to your physician. Your physician may order an oral glucose tolerance test which basically requires you to fast - tests your fasting glucose level then your actually given fluid containing glucose to drink and your blood levels are taken 5 times during a 3 hour period.  Please take a look at this page which contains some info about diabetes and its diagnosis:  Diabetes  The symptoms you are complaining from could be many things in addition to diabetes. I can understand that you are worried since you also have a family history of the disease. All these symptoms could also be related to anxiety/ depression.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello , I am a 16 year old female and I have been reading a lot about how the body hair is supposed to be fine and light except on your pubic region and if it's not you could have a hormonal imbalance . I have hair on my stomach and lowerback which is not light or very \"fine\" . I have shaved these areas before which may have mad them a tad darker but it is still just abnormal I think . All of my other girlfriends do not have this kind of hair .  What is the treatment for a hormonal imbalance? Would I be taking estrogen pills ? Even if I didn't have one and took estrogen pills would it make the hair on my body get lighter and thinner anyways ? I also under my arm pits have dark brownish red spots . I do wash my arm pits but that only seems to irritate the spots . What are those? Thank you , have a good day .  Sari\n\n",

If it were due to hormonal imbalance most probably you would be complaining of other symptoms as well. How are you cycles? As for the red spots i really can't tell from here but they sound like an infection or inflammation. Could be due to a type of deoderant that you recently used that is irritating them.

    "content": "Dear Shannon,  Thank you very much for using our website.  How old are you? Do you have chronic disease for which take chronic medications? Where do you live? Has the summer where you live been hotter and more humid than usual? Do you have frequency of urination in addition to thirst and drinking water all the time? Do you wake up at night to urinate and how frequent and what is the volume of the urine? What is your salt intake like?   Regarding the headache, dizziness and nausea. Do you have ringing in the ears or loss of hearing? Do you have blurring of vision? Do you wear glasses? Have you ever been seen an eye doctor or an ear, nose and throat doctor?   Regarding the thirst and drinking too much.  1. Could be just related to the hot weather that every body is experiencing.  2. It could be related to medications, some medications will give the sensation of a dry mouth and you will feel like you are thirsty and drink all the time. 3. Could be related to a new onset of diabetes.  You can take these ideas to your doctoe and start from there.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Jingle C. Sy-Quimpo  Tapazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Tapazole readily crosses the placental membranes and can induce goiter and even cretinism in the developing fetus. In addition, rare instances of aplasia cutis, as manifested by scalp defects, have occurred in infants born to mothers who received Tapazole during pregnancy. If Tapazole is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be warned of the potential hazard to the fetus.   Since scalp defects have not been reported in offspring of patients treated with propylthiouracil, that agent may be preferable to Tapazole in pregnant women requiring treatment with antithyroid drugs.   So you should consult with your doctor immediately to put you on alternative medication.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Catlover,  I am an medical oncologist so i you cannot say that i don't know what your mother is going through. I know how much my patients suffer from cancer. However, I do not condone euthenasia (merciful killing), especially that there are methods of dealing with every complication a cancer patient goes through. Whethere that be pain, dyspnea, depression. We can deal with it to some extent or another. Again its really not her right at all to take her life. Since when do we approve of people comitting suicide. We don't! Most of these suiciders are suffering too though it may not be cancer.  Now back to your question: If this is how she intends to die then its not the smoothest way. Coma due to ketoacidosis is a metabolic type of coma in contrast to a neurological type of coma (associated with a disease of the nervous system). Metabolic coma progresses slowly from consciousness to precoma to coma. It may take upto a week of suffering in the form of aggitation, delerium, confusion, nausea, vomiting, rapid breathing and many other symptoms.  Please take the time to visit this site:    http://www.euthanasia.com/  Try to help her change her mind. If you need any help with her case please use the cancer discussion forums and a specialist will guide you through her case.\n\n",

I get a lot of headaches (frequently, but they usually last only a couple seconds) and i've always had that, though my husband is worried.  About 3 times since this december, I have felt fluey. The first time I felt hot and dizzy (i was out at a comedy show and had to leave at the break). the second time i can remember I was freezing (to me) but my husband said I was boiling and I just didn't feel good.  Last night was the worst so far. I felt really hot, and dizzy, sweating and shaking and I also felt nauseus and going to bed my stomach felt strange and uncomfortable-as if something was moving about in there!. Most of today I have felt weak and shaking and sometimes a sore stomach.  This is the strangest thing: For about the last 2 months (i know i haven't been like this the whole time i have been here, I have been sweating and really hot so that I wear shorts (and t-shirts) outside, when everyone else is wearing big jackets and long pants and I think the weather is mild or warm. And I can be sweating not really doing anything, just sitting around the house. Most of the time i think the house is boiling and ask to turn the heat off, but it is already off!  My family has a history of diabetes (on my dad's side), i have tested myself regularly on the portable thing, and on my mom's side hypo (i think?) thyrodism in my grandma and mom's sister.  Thanks for any help! (ps. I am going to see a doctor soon about this very soon!)\n\n",

    "title": "Suspected hypocortisism",
    "content": "Dear Dr. Giovanni, Thank you for your question.  You must first confirm that indeed the patient has a pathologically low serum cortisol level.   Cortisol is secreted in circadian rythm with a maximum 5-25ug/dL in the early morning (8:00 am) and minimum values of 3-16ug/dL in the late afternoon.  To diagnose low serum cortisol (Addison's disease): Serum cortisol taken at 8:00am < 5ug/dL [SI:140nmol/L] (some authorities say < 3ug/dL [SI: 86nmol/L]) confirms the diagnosis. A result of > 20ug/dL [SI: 550nmol/L] excludes the diagnosis in an unstressed individual. Between these values if the condition is still suspected a rapid ACTH stimulation test should be performed. When impaired a long ACTH stimulation test should be performed to differentiate primary from secondary insufficiency. A high plasma ACTH level with a low or normal cortisol level confirms primary adrenocortical insufficiency.  You say that this is your patient's results. What is your patient suffering from?

    "title": "Low cortisol levels without symptoms",
    "content": "Dear Doctor Tamer Fouad, thank you for immediate answer.  I am an endocrinologist and now I'll give you more informations about the patient.  Male patient (58 yrs) with hypopituitarism (thyroid, adrenal, gonadal and growth hormone adult deficiency) due probable hypofisitis.  The failures of the thyroid, gonadal and growth hormone were adeguately corrected without any complications.  Also the secondary adrenal failure was terapeutized with cortisone treatment (37.5 mg/die), but this last kind of therapy induced the appearance of several side effects (hypertension, headache, hyperglicaemia, etc.) suggestive for an excess of corticosteroid therapy. Then, the cortisone treatment was stopped.  Now, after six months, the patients is off opotherapic adrenal treatment and, again, he presents very low cortisol levels without any symptoms.  What is the possible explanation about this situation? Is there  in your experience similar data in medical literature?  Thank you in advance. Giovanni Amato\n\n",

    "content": "Low cortisol by itself does not mean a lot. You need to have a stimulation test (cosyntropin test) to know whether the low cortisol levels are of signficance or not. Those with low cortisol may respond normally to the stimulation test. Then they are normal. However if they do not respond normally to the stimulation test, then they are considered to have SIGNFICANT low cortisol. At that time they should have more tests to find out the reason for the low cortisol. Those reasons may be in the brain (hypothalmus or pituitary) or may be in the adrenal gland itself or may be because people take cortisol pills (e.g. prednisone...)\n\n",
