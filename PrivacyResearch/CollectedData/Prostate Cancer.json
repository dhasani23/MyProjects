They have been searching for WHERE it had spread and just found it on his 4 and 5 lumbar and spread down to his sacrum. He was told inopperable and advanced stages but possible radiation. He's in good health otherwise. My question is; can you estimate how long before he succumbs to the cancer? How fast does it spread? What progression can we anticipate? Paralization? Extreme pain? Any info would be helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Bone metastasis significantly reduce the life expectancy and quality of life which ultimately lead to pathological fractures,reduced motility,pain,and bone marrow failure.The main area of seeding is the red marrow,and spread to multiple areas.Radiopharmaceutical drugs when given, lead to significant pain relief.Since the cancer cell interact with the bone tissue and take part in a paracrine way stimulating bone growth at the same time growing more,the cancer spreads.The more high grade the cancer is faster the spread.Also the use of endocrine therapy,the duration and intensity will have bearing on the severity of skeletal metastasis.

    "content": "Hi, Dr.Jagesh has already concisely explained the complications due to the bony mets.  The following two studies may address your concerns regarding the prediction of prognosis.  Soloway et al, suggested a semiquantitative grading system based upon the extent of disease observed on the bone scintigram, namely that patients with fewer than six metastatic deposits had a significantly better 2-year survival rate than those with more extensive metastases. Patients with a superscan or its equivalent, which means bone metastases in >75% of the ribs, vertebrae and pelvic bones, had a significantly poorer 2-year survival rate than those with fewer metastatic sites. [Soloway MS, Hardeman SW, Hickey D, Raymond J, Todd B, Soloway S, et al. Stratification of patients with metastatic prostate cancer based on extent of disease on initial bone scan. Cancer (1988) 61:195\u2013202].  Others have not found this grading system reliable. No correlation between the survival time after the detection of bone metastases and the number of lesions at the time of detection was found. Kazuo Ohmori et al conclude thus:   \u201cwe think that the prediction of the prognosis cannot be made at the time of the detection of bone metastases, because the response to therapies for bone metastases, such as chemotherapy, radiation or hormone therapy, differs with the type of cancers and with the individual\u201d. [Kazuo Ohmori et al. Japanese Journal of Clinical Oncology 27:263-267 (1997)].  There are a few reports suggesting that serial bone scintigrams are valuable in predicting the prognosis in patients with metastatic breast and prostate cancers. It appears the the \"rate of increase\" in the number of bone metastases on serial bone scintigrams is useful for estimation of the prognosis in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

    "content": "Hi, Testosterone is known to increase bone density. The only way (to the best of my knowledge) to connect testosterone therapy to 'osteolytic' bone lesions is by its association with  'Acne fulminans', a form of fulminant acne and osteolytic lesions have been reported in this condition.I do not know if your brother happens to have severe acne which developed while on testosterone therapy.   PSA ranges differ by race. The normal, or what is considered to be the safe range for European-American men aged  50 to 80 is  0 - 3.5 ng/ml.   The range for African-American men is quoted to be 0 to 2.0 ng/ml for men in their 40s, rising to 4.0 when they are in their 50s, 4.5 in their 60s, and 5.5 in their 70s.  A PSA value of 18000 needs to be repeated,preferably at a different laboratory! Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It would have been very helpful if you had told us whether the Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) that was identified in your prostatic biopsy specimen was low grade or high grade.I have to assume it to be high grade as you have been advised 'avodart'.  (PIN) is classified as 'low grade' and 'high grade'. The high grade variety is the one which is believed to increase the risk of prostatic cancer.Also, Multifocal PIN perhaps, has the highest risk.  It appears that in patients with high-grade PIN, the chance of developing prostatic cancer is about 35 to 40 percent in a five-year period.   In patients with low-grade PIN, it appears that the risk of developing cancer is about 15 to 20 percent over a 10-year period (some believe that this type has no increased risk at all).   In patients whose biopsies didn\u2019t show any PIN, the chance of developing cancer in the future is about 10 percent. Many would agree, i believe, that currently there is no approved treatment for risk reduction in prostate cancer  Some workers may recommend prophylactic drug therapy (chemoprevention) in men who have high risk indicators  such as   age, suspicious findings on rectal exam,high PSA level,a high BMI [body mass index], a positive family history,etc.  If PIN(high grade) is present, then the risk period for development of cancer is quite long - even upto 10 years. PIN might regress on chemoprevention, but whether the risk also decreases.....only further studies ought to reveal!  Your doctor should be the one to decide whether to stop it or to continue.

    "content": "Hello,  Thank you for your question.   Regarding anal sex and prostate cancer, it obviously poses no increased risk of recurrence as I am sure you are aware. However, I understand that your concern is whether anal sex can affect the area of surgery. I am assuming this is a retro pubic resection. If you underwent a perineal resection there are concerns about higher rates of rectal incontinence.  Transrectal manipulations such as a rectal exam or transrectal sonar or biopsy are known sometimes to raise the PSA levels temporarily and can affect follow up if the prostate is intact. Even vigorous cycling and heterosexual activity can cause a transient rise in PSA levels. In your case I am assuming that there isn't any prostate tissue left.  It would be difficult for me to answer this question without having all the data. I am unable to give you the go ahead on this forum. I understand your need for discretion and you may consider a second opinion at a University Hospital where staff will approach your concern in a professional manner.  I hope that helps.\n\n",

A PET scan is a functional scan that is very sensitive for detecting the presence of cancer. There may be a role for PET scanning if your father's work up (including bone scan) is negative.

    "content": "Hi there, I agree with Asis but would like to add that benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) usually appears in older individuals with a prevalence of 80% in men above the age of 80 years. That said, even cancers of the prostate can appear in men as young as 40 years old.  Symptoms of prostate disease are usually of the voiding and post-micturition type rather than the storage variety (eg, daytime frequency or nocturia). However, they can sometimes be the dominant symptoms in prostate disease.  I would think with your complaint and the pattern of pain (tenderness rather) that you probably have a thrombosed hemorroid. This classically leads to the sitting on a 'golf ball' sensation. In this case the frequency and the back pain would be unrelated.  Again as Dr. Asis suggested an examination is in order.\n\n",

    "content": "My husband had testicular cancer and lost one testicle 14 yrs ago.  He's doing well and all test are fine.  About 5 years ago he asked the Dr to test for low testostrone and he came back borderline low.  The Dr put him on Androgel and he's been on it ever since.  I have serious concerns about this since the Dr has never retested to be sure the levels are right and I worry about Prostate cancer.  He has had and continues to have problems with urinary flow and leakage (which he doesn't tell his Dr), he no doubt has sleep apnea (I listen to him at night ... not breathing, snoring, snorting to get a breath and not feeling rested in the morning), again, he doesnt' tell his Dr this and also, he's become much more easily aggitated about things, angry and obsessive at times.  We've been married 24 yrs and I've notice a big difference in his personality this past 5 years.  I'd like to send his Dr a letter telling him all the things that my husband won't bring up (he's afraid the Dr will test him and take away the androgel), he also has told me that he doesn't use the androgel each year when he has blood work done just in case they test his testostrone level so I presume he knows it may be high.  The Dr only checks PSA, Testicular Cancer markers, and CBC.  I feel like he's addicted to the drug and the \"high\" it gives him and isn't able to consider (and doesnt' want to  think about) the long term problems which obviously would affect us both.  What type of follow up should be being done?  Is his Dr liable to share info that I send to him about problems that he's having that he's not sharing?  Obviously, he'd be angry at me if he knew I'd shared info with the Dr about problems he's having.   I don't want to see him end up with prostate cancer when it could possibly be minimalized by customizing his testostrone doseage and better follow up care.  Can you help me so I can do what's right for him?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Androgel is a gel containing 1% testosterone. Indications of its use include men who have testicular failure diagnosed by low serum testosterone levels and above normal gonadotropins (FSH, LH) levels.  Serum testosterone levels are measured 14 days after therapy initiation to ensure proper dosing and serum level.  It is true that testosterone esters can potentiate sleep apnea, especially in obese individuals or patients with chronic lung diseases. Depression, nervousness and emotional lability are known side effects that resulted in discontinuation of therapy in some studies.  Patients on testosterone replacement therapy should undergo screening for prostate cancer with PSA and DRE every 6-12 month. PSA is the most useful test for prostate cancer screening and it is reassuring that his doctor regularly examine him clinically and order a blood evaluation for PSA. Any warning or new symptoms should be reported to initiate proper investigations that include non invasive techniques like transrectal US.   I understand your worry about his symptoms and his reaction if you inform his doctor without his agreement. However, it is essential to inform his doctor with his current symptoms for proper management. You have to try to convince him get checked and to make sure he is going to inform his doctor with all his complaints. His doctor should also know hat your husband is not following the recommended dose so that testosterone level evaluation is essential.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While I don't know what the specific statistics are on this type of cancer recurrence, I can tell you a couple things. First, any cancer carries a risk of recurrence. A cancer which recurs carries a statistically worse prognosis than a first-time cancer in the same location. All that being said, cancer is pretty much an ongoing problem, and while we always hope it won't recur, it can. It hasn't,  apparently, spread to any other part  of his body, so it's still localized and the doctors are aware of it. If it hasn't spread, prostate cancer is one of the more manageable ones. So the statistical chances for survival improve, theoretically because of that. It's difficult to say, without a lot of specifics, just how this bout of prostate cancer may play out, but it could be the original cancer was treated conservatively, which means it could be treated more radically this time (with removal of the prostate). There's no telling how this will turn out, but it is a better scenario than many are, and one can't compare one type of cancer with another, nor one case with another.   Hopefully your uncle's doctors are on  top of the problem -- since once one has had cancer, one has to be followed for it anyway,  even if it seems to be gone. This works to your uncle's advantage.  Best of luck to your uncle in his fight with this.  Please stay in touch here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This is confusing indeed. Reducing FSH and LH to low levels is actually one of the methods used to treat advanced prostate cancer tumors as these hormones are responsible for the production of endogenous androgens which enhance tumor growth.  Irregularity / asymmetry in the prostate gland requires that we rule out cancer. Your PSA level will help in the differential diagnosis.  Please update this topic and let us know how things turned out.  Best of luck!\n\n",

Diagnosed with prostate cancer three years ago and underwent radiation therapy successfully. PSA very low. Problem: Rectal bleeding (thought to be a by-product of the radiation--treated but not corrected), severe anemia diagnosed Dec 2005 not responding well to medication, debilitating, intermittent back painfirst appearing May 2005 for which he uses a TENS unit and prescription medication. Has just begun to complain of pain in his groin.   Even though he completed radiation and follow up PSA's appear OK, can this cancer have spread to his bones or lymph system? Could this current batch of symptoms be related to a metastacized slow growing cancer? If the PSA is low, does that mean just the prostate itself is not the problem? Can you have a low PSA and still be dealing with a cancer--just not neccessarily a prostate cancer?  Thank you so very much for your insight--he's not exactly forthcoming, and I need help getiing him help.\n\n",

When I looked at my penis, I realized that it was because the foreskin had been pulled back. It was kind of wierd, the foreskin was pulled back far enough so I could see the smegma, kind of like when I wash my smegma in the shower. So when I saw it, I just cleaned off some of the smegma and pushed the foreskin back into place... This has been happening more recently now, it just happened a couple of days ago. I wanted to know if this is normal or what might be causing it. My theory is that I could be that I get an erection at night, and some how the foreskin gets pushed back. Please reply if you have any idea, as I am getting worried.\n\n",
