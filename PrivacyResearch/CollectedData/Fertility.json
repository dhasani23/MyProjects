    "content": "I have confirmed though charting my basal body temperature that I've ovulated every cycle for the past 7 months.  My cycles are very regular, as I typically ovulate around CD 19 and get my period about 13 days later.  However, last cycle I ovulated late, around CD 23.  However, because of some unusual cramping and bleeding, my doctor sent me for a sonogram before ovulation.  I went in on CD 16, and was told that I had no mature follicles at that time.  My largest follicle was 8mm... far from the 20mm needed to be considered a \"mature\" follicle.    Now I'm really confused.  Could it be that I am going to ovulate late again this month, and if so, how long would it take an 8mm follicle to grow to the proper size?  If the follicle does not grow bigger, will it still get released, or will I just not ovulate at all this month?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Debd14,  The body has an amazing way of being able to regulate ovulation.  If the egg is not mature, ovulation may be delayed for a few days and your cycle will adjust accordingly.  Occasionally, an immature egg may be released that will not fertilize or, alternatively, there may be an anovulatory cycle where no egg is released.  If your cycle is off one month it may return to its normal pattern the next or may be off again and slowly correct (or set a new baseline).  The possibilities are varied and there is no good way to determine which will happen.  I cannot tell you how long the egg will take to grow from 8 to 20 mm.  I don't actually know.  For that matter, I don't know if that question is answerable as no one may actually know.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My report states that both tubes are open, but I am looking for a second opinion on this.  It appears as if my left tube is obstructed or behind an organ, possibly - making it hard to see the flow of dye / spill.  Does this look like a normal HSG to you?  Based on the pictures, are you able to tell if my tubes look generally healthy?  I am concerned about the slight widening of my right tube between the mid and fimbrial portion (it gets skinnier after it gets wider), and confirming that there is definitely spill from my left tube and that it doesn't appear as if dye from my right tube leaked over towards the left.  My pictures can be found by selecting the link below:  http://img.makeupalley.com/1/8/0/6/1705761.JPEG  I had a laparoscopy before the HSG and they determined both tubes were blocked (right was opened with extra dye / pressure, left was blocked proximally or may have been in spasm). No scar tissue/adhesions and everything looked normal.   I sincerely appreciate your time and opinion.\n\n",

Generally with x-ray films, other tissue in front of the tube may change the shading a bit but don't generally hide contrast dye from showing up on the films.  I cannot comment on the characteristics of the right tube other than to say that it appears to be intact and unblocked.  I would recommend you follow up with your gynecologist regarding this to get a more definitive opinion.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Being on birth control pills to regulate your periods can result in some hormonal changes that might alter your periods but this is not a problem except for the discomfort.  Keep in mind, in a healthy woman where both partners are fertile and actively trying to conceive, it still is considered normal for it to take up to a year since there is a certain amount of luck involved in the fertilization and implantation process, timing, etc.  Try to be patient with this.  The discharge color change is not concerning either in absence of other symptoms.  You may want to try an ovulator predictor kit or Cycle beads to track your fertility times.  The beads are effective when you have regular cycles between 26 and 32 days in duration.  This just helps you predict the days you should definitely be having intercourse but regular sexual activity is usually sufficient and you need not limit it to fertile days.  Best wishes and good luck in your efforts.\n\n",

After research I came across a condition known as Endometriosis, my periods became unbearable to the point where i couldn't move and would just lay on the floor in excruciating pain for hours until the pain went away even after taking Vicodin. About 3 weeks ago i went to my doctor and told him what was going on so he set me up for some ultrasounds. My results came back and it stated that my uterine lining was abnormally thick and he prescribed me Provera to take for 10 days to shed the extra lining. I am currently on my period and i guess the Provera is working since this is my 1st day and i am in a lot of pain and passing huge clots. My question is if the Provera does work successfully and everything goes well, what will be my chances of getting pregnant after my period goes off and what will be the next step to try and conceive. If you have answers and advice please help.  v/r AshCheat89\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It sounds like you have made progress in determining the cause of your delayed efforts to conceive.  Keep in mind that at your age your chances are very good that it will happen with patience.  Getting the hormonal treatments should result in a more favorable uterine lining for implantation, assuming you are ovulating.  You need to start here and move forward over time so patience is important.    You may be advised to use an ovulation predictor kit to help determine the best days for fertility or you can try using something like Cycle Beads for this purpose.  Most women are able to conceive within a year with regular sexual intercourse (assuming both partners are fertile) and so once your problems are resolved chances are very good.  Your husband may be advised to have a sperm analysis to make sure things are working on his end as well.    If you are found to not be ovulating, there are medications to assist.  If you have endometriosis, there are treatments to assist with this as well so don't give up.  Most treatments are done through your regular OB/GYN and do not require an infertility specialist but if necessary there are other techniques thanks to modern medicine.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I just went to a ob/gyn today for the first time in my life and I didn't get the experience I was hoping for. I am 23 years old and have one 4 year old daughter. I have been trying to conceive since then but, mostly the last 2 and a half years and have not yet been successful. The doctor that I seen today was kind of nice I guess but, didn't take her time, the whole time it seemed like she was in a rush and I do not think she explained things thoroughly enough to where I could understand anything. I basically left out of there completely confused and now I have a lot of unanswered questions. All she did was stick her fingers up in me as if she was performing a pap smear while feeling and pressing down all around my belly. After she finished with that, she said it feels like I might have an ovarian cyst which she didn't even tell me what that is and then tells me to get dressed and meet her back at the front of the office/desk. She then schedules me for another appointment on September 8 to come back and have an ultrasound. She also wants me to have blood work done as well but, I cannot go she said until 2-3 after my period, did not explain why just said to check a few things but, that was it. I was hoping she would be more thorough, explain things tome a bit better like what are ovarian cysts, etc. I want to know what that is and if it serious because if it is then I would think she have had me get an ultrasound today either there or could've sent to the hospital. What causes infertility, what are ovarian cysts and how can she assume I might have that without doing an ultrasound??? My mom told me they should do an ultrasound on my belly and vaginally, right? I need help, I need advice/suggestions please! If you need anymore info just ask me, thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: How to properly treat infertility?",
    "content": "Hello, Many women experience ovarian cysts in their lifetimes and in most cases there are no symptoms so they are not even aware.  Your doctor may have felt something to indicate a cyst was present but the reason an ultrasound is done later is because these cysts so often go away without treatment or problems.  She wants to see if this resolves on its own.  If not, she can decide then if further treatment is needed.  The wait and see approach is considered normal and good medical practice.   The ovarian cyst is simply a fluid-filled sac in the ovary.  Sometimes cysts occur along with endometriosis which can affect fertility but usually there are symptoms with that.    There are many causes of infertility.  It sometimes just takes a while.  You might try using an ovulation predictor kit to help you determine the best time for intercourse to coincide with ovulation dates when trying to conceive.  Often it is just a matter of patience because everything has to happen at the right time and under the right circumstances for conception and implantation to occur.  You might say it involves a certain amount of luck.  Your doctor will probably systematically rule out potential causes - first the cyst, then other conditions such as pituitary or thyroid health which can affect the female hormones as well as others in the body.    Sometimes a woman can even worry about this so much that she can actually stop ovulating so try to reduce your stress in your life.  In the meantime, be sure to take a daily multivitamin, use good health practices and habits, stop any bad habits and be sure you are in a healthy weight range.  All these things will help assure a healthy pregnancy when it does happen.  It is also important for your husband to avoid alcohol and take care of his own health, especially ruling out infections.   In some very rare cases, the woman rejects the man's sperm, similar to an allergy but this is really not very common at all.  Most likely patience is what you need but if the cyst goes away, like we would expect, your doctor may prescribe an ovulation stimulator drug such as clomid but because of the risk of multiples, it's best not to do this until you have explored all avenues that might be interfering with ovulation and conception first.  The fact that you are young and have had one child with your husband is very encouraging that you will be able to do it again.  Good luck in your efforts and best wishes.\n\n",

I know it is frustrating when you want to be able to determine when this happens but truth is, it is not considered a fertility problem prior to the year mark.  Having a previous loss as you did does not increase your risk at all since this is a fairly common event for women.  Patience and having regular sex during the most likely fertile time is your best procedure at this time.  If you worry about the biological clock you can see a specialist after six months of effort but it is likely things just need time.  However, if you are anxious you can get on with fertility assistance sooner that way.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Fabric would make it extremely difficult for sperm to get where it needs to go to impregnate you.  Of course a latex condom would be the best protection and if you are going to be sexually active this would be a good measure for the future.  Even with full penetration pregnancy does not always occur but without penetration the chances are very slim that the sperm could travel that far.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 20 year old boy. My girlfriend, who is 17, and I were fooling around 2 days ago. She had her panties on, and I was exciting her by pressing my penis against her vagina. There was no insertion since her panties were on. It got a little intense and I ejaculated after a while onto her panties. She removed and changed her panties within 30 seconds of my ejaculation. Do we run the risk of a possible pregnancy? Can sperms travel through clothing that fast? Also I am worried about pre-ejaculate. I read on the internet that it contains sperms, if the boy has not urinated after his last ejaculation. But I am sure that I have urinated at least 3-4 times, since the last time I ejaculated, which was when I was masturbating, 2 days before this incident. Please help me and tell me if we run the risk of a possible pregnancy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Pregnancy under these circumstances is virtually impossible.  Sperm needs a pretty direct route and really must be placed in or near the vagina in a liquid environment (they \"swim\" to get through the cerix and to a waiting egg).  Of course this also implies that the timing must be right when an egg is actually present at the right time for pregnancy to occur.  You should not worry, but it would be wise for you to discuss contraception for future encounters since you are just a step away from intercourse which of course can lead to pregnancy.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There can be active sperm in pre-ejaculate but getting through fabric would be quite a trick.  If he had penetrated it is possible some sperm could get through but on the outside of the vagina in the labia area, the chances would be slim.  And, four days following your period is a relatively \"safe\" time for most women.  Perhaps you want to consider discussing contraceptive methods with your partner so you can find something reliable that you are both comfortable with and will allow you to worry less.

    "content": "On June 23, 2010 I thought I was 3 months pregnant with  my 2nd child. I went to the emergency room with some light bleeding and discovered the baby had passed away at 9 weeks 2 days. I opted to have a D and C to get the process over with quickly. The procedure went very well and I had little to no bleeding within one week. My  husband and I began having intercourse again almost right away. We have been doing weekly blood tests to monitor my HcG levels back to below 5. The first result was 19, then I missed a week of testing. Last week my HcG levels were at 5! Then, surprisingly, this past week they went back UP to 25! Is this normal. My Dr. says it is highly unlikely that there is retained tissue due to the D and C, but she is concerned about molar pregnancy (which really scares me.) I am also wondering if its possible I could be pregnant again so soon after my miscarriage. My last HcG test was July 21st (25hcg) and yestered I tested positive on a home pregnancy test. Do HcG levels normally go back up after falling so low? Could I be pregnant again? If so, isn't a level of 25hcg too low? My Dr. is on vacation so Im very worried right now.\n\n",

Hcg levels do not usually rise after they have fallen unless you are pregnant so you should follow this up, take a prenatal vitamin (or multivitamin).  If the embryo is viable your levels will continue to rise steadily.  If it is not, there is nothing you can do to change this.  Miscarriage is nature's way of dealing with these things when the baby doesn't develop properly.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You didn't give dates of your periods so I am not real clear on this - what date you are using to determine you would be about 10 weeks.    It is possible to have symptoms you describe without being pregnant.  There is a good chance you are not since you had sex the day after your period and you had another period after that.  Usually a period is a good indication you are not pregnant.  However, if you have been having intercourse since the one time you describe and if the period was quite light and shorter there is the chance it could be implantation bleeding and not a true period.  You could repeat the pregnancy test a week after the first one if you continue to have symptoms including no period.    If you see a doctor for a pregnancy test they will either do urine or blood to verify pregnancy.  Then, when you start your prenatal care you will have a complete physical exam, including a pap smear and test for some infections.  Usually the doctor also checks for immunity to german measles, HIV, etc.  He/she will check your breasts manually to be sure you don't have any unusual lumps, etc.  If you are not pregnant, the doctor can assist you in finding a reliable method of birth control.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "She would not have been at a highly fertile time, though it can be hard to say when periods are irregular.  Having used a condom I think you can probably feel quite safe.  You are correct about the discharge possibly being related to ovulation so she is likely just late ovulating and therefore will be late on her period.  She could take a home pregnancy test now and it should be quite reliable.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Debbie- My head is spinning from reading just about everything I could get my hands on over the internet - but then i realized, those are clinical excerpts. What I need is advice from women who 'live' through it.  For starters, I am a 28yr old asian woman (we evidently have a tendency to conceive at the drop of a hat!!) - my fiance and i are sexually involved -althu on a sporadic basis seeing as i travel for work as does he. If we are lucky, we get to be together 2/3 months in a month. We plan on getting married by July this year and till then (and for a year or so over) we don't plan on parenthood.  My concerns have recently been heightened with working out when its safe for us to have sex without fear of my getting pregnant. Yes, the asian society is very conservative about shotgun weddings!  My periods were fairly regular. I did have 35-40day cycles in my late teens but for the past 2/3 years ive been rather regular in so far as my dates are concerned.  Brief history of my period dates/cycle:  4th November 2007  3rd December 2007  1st January 2008  Each period lasts 4 days - i go heavy on the first and second days. Start slowing down by evening of 3rd day and by 4th im either all clear or very slightly on the rag.   Now - in january 2008, my fiance was in town and the two of us had just one night to be together. The nite of 5/6th Jan.  We got busy.  He doesnt wear condoms. (He cant perform with them.) I am on no contraceptive plan. The pill scares me. I already have heavy hips. And the side-effect indicating pills increasing hip-width, weight and hair growth has put me off the idea of touching the pill!  Normally he doesn't ejaculate in me, but this night i asked him too - reckoning i was so within my safe zone seeing as i had just finished my period the day before.  To still play safe, i took the morning-after/emergency pill the following day.  And then my period disappeared! I went thru so many home-pregnancy kits!!  And then i got my period on the 13th of Feb'08.  Stretching my normally one month cycle to a 44day cycle.  Freak incident? Stress? (I lost my father in december...work has been busy...and to lose myself into sheer exhaustion so i can sleep, i go for an intense workout everyday of the week)  Whatever the reason - i don't want a repeat performance of anxiety levels that we both touched caused by the delay in my period.  Henceforth - when are safe zones? If i want to be with him this weekend, am i pushing my luck?  I will be so grateful if i could be taken through this zoning crisis!  Look forward to your input!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I actually had answered this post but for some reason it's not here so I must have done something wrong.  Sorry for the delay.  The most risky time for pregnancy is day 8 through day 19 if you start counting on the first day of your last period.  With regular cycles you may ovulate any time between those days.  It is hard to predict exactly when and a few women even ovulate outside these dates.  So, it would be wise to use some form of contraception during those days if not all the time.  If you are not together frequently it may be that you don't want anything like an IUD, implant or birth control pill, though many women use these without side effects once their body adjusts.    Taking the \"morning after pill\" or \"plan b\" or \"emergency contraception\" does throw your periods off due to the high level of hormones.  It can take a while to get back into a pattern, so if you are wanting to use a natural family planning method, use of emergency contraception (EC) will make it more difficult.  It is not meant to be used as birth control and I don't recommend you use it that way, even when you don't have regular sexual intercourse.  Since you do not plan to start your family soon, one of the other methods might be a good idea for you and they are quite safe and reliable.    If you want to have sex without birth control, especially between days 8 and 19, you are definitely taking a risk.  85% of women will become pregnant within the year if having sex during this time frame.   If you have regular periods between 26 and 32 days and avoid these unsafe days, your risk goes down to about 2-3%.  Not perfect but close to other methods of birth control.   You can also learn to be in touch with your vaginal secretions.  If you notice an increase in the secretions (yesterday or today) it is likely you are ovulating and should avoid intercourse.  This means any day - ask yourself, \"did I have secretions yesterday?\"  If the answer is yes, don't have sex today.  Also ask yourself, \"do I have secretions today?\"  If the answer is yes, don't have unprotected sex today.  If the secretions were three days ago, you are likely not ovulating.  This is called the \"two day method of natural family planning.\"  It is also quite reliable for motivated women who learn to recognize the discharge changes in their bodies.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Well.. i have been spotting now for 4 days close to 5! I am supposed to start my period this coming week! I am cramping off and on and i don't know what is going on! I took a pregnancy test on the 7th and 8th! They both said negative! Am i testing too early? Am i pregnant? If so i would be around 3 weeks since conception!

    "content": "Hello, This could be some type of vaginal infection, since you have noticed an odor.  I would not consider it urgent enough for an ER visit, however.  I think you need to wait and be patient just a bit longer.  The tests are quite reliable about a week after your period was due, though for some women with some home tests results may be positive earlier than that - you just can't depend on it.  If you are pregnant, it is also quite common to have some spotting early on - usually about the time of your regular period.  It is also common to have midcycle spotting, even though you haven't had it before.  At any rate, there are several possibilities, but none of a critical nature.   It is definitely too early for pregnancy to be determined by ultrasound.  Not so many years ago women had to wait weeks for signs to determine pregnancy.  These days we get impatient with a few days.  Try not to worry too much while waiting a bit longer.  Good luck - whatever your wish is in this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It sounds like you had sex during a time that was very likely a fertile period for you so pregnancy is a very real possibility.  It is also possible that your period is delayed due to stress (as in thinking about this possibility!).    The tests can be negative if taken early in pregnancy.  Most are reliable about a week after your period was due but some women have low HcG levels and this can result in a negative test.  Usually it is recommended you repeat the test weekly as long as you have symptoms, such as no period.  Other symptoms do not occur in all women so you can't count on these for pregnancy confirmation.  They can also develop later.    You can also get a serum (blood) test which is more sensitive than the urine testing.  If you are not pregnant, may I suggest finding a reliable method of birth control both of you are comfortable with.  You can also ask a doctor about plan B so you can have this on hand in case of emergency contraceptive needs, but this should not be used as regular birth control.  I would also remind you that all women of childbearing years (even if you are not planning to become pregnant) should take a daily multiple vitamin containing at least 400 mcg folate or folic acid.  Since half of all pregnancies are \"unintended\" and folic acid is so critical to early fetal development, it just makes sense.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You are correct that your periods can be affected by the pill.  You should continue to take the pills as prescribed regardless of the period showing up or not.  The chances of pregnancy are not very great, especially if you have taken the pills every day.  Chances are this is just normal missed periods due to hormonal regulation and even though most women have some bleeding - if very light - sometimes this happens.   Taking the pills is not harmful but if you do feel you are pregnant and get a positive pregnancy test, you should stop then.  While taking birth control pills regularly it is not necessary to take regular pregnancy tests each time your period is delayed.  Long before home pregnancy tests were available women were successfully using this method of birth control.  In the rare case of pregnancy while on the pill, it is OK to stop the pill at that time.  Best wishes.\n\n",

We've done this before and she didnt get pregnant and then we did it again and shes a day late on her period. Im worried. Whats the chances of her being pregnant? And if someone had ejaculated in their pants and then put their penis in a vagina a few hours later would the women be pregnant?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is a chance of pregnancy because of \"pre-cum\" which can leak before ejaculation.  This is not a great possibility but it is real.  This is why pulling out is not a reliable method of birth control, though it does improve your odds over regular ejaculation.  The chances of pregnancy from penetration after ejaculation could still have some risk involved for the same reason.  You could produce more fluid, that might contain sperm and could conceivably leak.    Have your girlfriend take a home pregnancy test.  If negative and she still doesn't get her period, have her repeat it a week later or have a serum (blood) test done in a clinic or doctor's office.  These are more sensitive.    For future sexual activity, please use a latex condom to ease both of your minds.  It also reduces the risk of sexually transmitted infections.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   I posted my situation earlier but I'm still having some doubts. Could what I thought was my period just be due to the fact that it was the first time I had sex so i bled? There were some clots, which is why i thought it was my period. Its been almost a week now and there is still some blood flow but its a lot less than before but it's not as heavy as my normal period. Could it be that I took the plan b and its messing up my period? Can having sex for the first time mess up your cycle? The time we had sex was definitely around the time i get my period. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Sometimes almost all women have irregular cycles, missed periods, different flow, etc.  This makes it hard to guess at what is going on.  In addition, plan B definitely affects the hormones and most women report that it does mess up their periods.  Some do bleed after sex the first time, especially if the hymen was still present and/or things went quickly without good lubrication.  However, this would not likely be the cause of heavy and prolonged bleeding.  You could have the effect of plan b in your system for a little while and you cannot depend on your periods being predictable for possibly even a few months.  If you are very worried about pregnancy, take a test. These are usually reliable as early as 10 days after conception.    I hope this helps.  Good luck.\n\n",

The bleeding is so faint I can only tell it is there when I wipe and it is accompanied by a creamy texture kind of like egg white only pink. Is this concidered breakthrough bleeding? Should I go see my doctor about it and find out why its going on? I have just started day 1 of week 3 on the patch and should not start my period until my week free of the patch. I have had a lot of nausia with headachs that come and go, lower back pain, soar and tender breast, some weight gain that fluxuates from 5-7lbs that come and go as well, also I have a stuffy nose that goes runny then back to stuffy and thought I was coming down with a cold or flu. I also have to pee a lot but I usually have to pee so if that was a sign I am not sure I would be able to tell. One day I will be 160 then 165 to 169 then drop back down to 160 again. I am just not sure if it is because I just recently switched from the pill to the patch and my body is getting used to the hormones or what is going on. I have been haing unprotected sex soly relying on the BC to prevent pregnancy. I am not sure what the odds are of me being pregnant being that the symptoms I am feeling could most likely be related to the patch. Can anyone please help me?!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your symptoms sound most like hormonal adjustment to me.  Even the weight fluctuation can be the result of water retention - also related to hormones.  The patch is a very reliable birth control method and additional measures should not be needed.  No method is 100% effective except abstinence but I would not initially think pregnancy here.  It can take a few cycles for your body to regulate so I would give it a little time.  Your other concerns are probably viral (common cold).  If you get no period when expected, you can take a pregnancy test to be sure but even that could be related to the patch and your body's response.  It just might give you peace of mind - wait until a few days after you expect the period.  Because hormonal birth control stops ovulation, pregnancy under these circumstances is quite rare.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "hi, me and my girlfriend were having an intimate session. i licked her and possibly gave her an orgasm (she does not not understand the feeling). then i took out my penis. when i did so a line of transparent yet slightly greyish fluid stuck to my underwear (like a web hanging from two ends) and broke off onto the underside of my penis. Then after around 5-10 seconds she came and sat on the underside of my penis rubbing her pussy on the underside of my penis for about 10 seconds. She was very wet and warm. 2 days after that day she has been complaining of weakness and feeling dizzy. She also feels vomitish at times but she says that vomitish feeling is not new for her. She has been complaining of severe leg pain too.5 days after that day she fell on her back and has been complaing of back pain also. She also told me that 2-3 times she has had the feeling that she's losing her balance and falling down. and about a week after THE day she also had an instance of profue sweating and dizzy feeling (after an arguement with me). I would like to bring to your notice that i had not ejaculated but had masterbated about two hours before our intimate session; there was no direct contact with the penis head (i'm not circumcised); the day we had our session was 5th day after her last periods got over. Could she be pregnant? She also tells me that she has liver problems (part of it has gone bad). she is 20 yrs old.Please help. what are the symptoms i should be looking for.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  Not a worry here (would be happy to be pregnant) more of a query of is it possible.  I was on Microgynon up until 3rd April when I finished the last pack.  Wednesday I started my \"false period\"and this is also the day I was switched over to Cerazette at the doctors.  The doctor told me at the time that for the first 7 days I may not be covered so to be careful for at least a week.  I told my husband this but he wasn't worried and said if we get pregnant that would be great.  So from saturday until now we've been at it like rabbits.  This morning (14th) I have a swollen feeling in my lower abdomen even though it looks normal.  Is it more likely to be the effect of the pill or could I possibly have conceived (women in my family seem to feel symptoms pretty quick when pregnant).  If so when would be the best time to test?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am 32 years old and have suffered a miscarriage 5 months ago which was at 5 1/2 weeks along.  The doctor never mentioned performing a D&C, so I never questioned it.  My periods came back quickly, but were 23 days apart as opposed to 26 like before.  Then suddenly in Feb, it was 31 days late, and I had cramps like the whole week before I started, and after I finished.  Then in March I had a similar experience where I spotted for 2 days, nothing for 2 days, and then started with heavy period and ended with cramps even after the bleeding had stopped.  Then this month, I think I ovulated on April 7th, because I had egg white CM a few days before and pain on my left side all day of the 7th.  My hubby and I had intercourse the day before that, and now it is a week later.  I had cramps like 3 days after I suspected ovulation, and then they stopped, but here it is 1 week later, and 1 week before I suspect I will get my period and I have had awful cramps all day that tylenol has not helped.  My OB/GYN cannot see me for 2 more weeks.  I know it is too early to test for possible pregnancy, but I am concerned that this is not normal.  So much cramping with no bleeding can't be good.  Could this be an early sign of pregnancy?  Or can something like ovarian cysts be causing my pain?  They didn't see any abnormal cysts when I had ultrasounds done 5 months ago for the miscarriage.  Oh, and I have never had irregular periods or had trouble with cramps before these last 2.  Any info you can provide would be greatly appreciated as I am freaking out and can't see my doctor for 2 more weeks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If you had engaged in intercourse, there would be a possibility of pregnancy but it does require semen to be deposited inside the vagina so if yours was oral sex and external stimulation, chances of pregnancy really do not exist.  I suspect her symptoms are related to something else.  She may have vertigo which results in balance problems and nausea, dizziness and easy falls.  She should see a doctor about it.  If t here was penitration with sex, she should be able to do a home pregnancy test around the time she would expect her next period.  They're not 100% at that point but usually accurate.  Missing a period is usually the first sign of pregnancy.  Good luck.\n\n",

If she has been taking the pill, that alone is typically adequate protection against pregnancy.  Missing pills does mean some risk that ovulation could occur.   Have her take a pregnancy test if her period does not start near the expected time.  Best wiahes\n\n",

My periods stopped on tuesday and I had sex with my boyfriend for the first time on wednesday , and we had sex again  on thursday, and i took a birth control pill on thursday.

The problem is, since I've been home from college, I have been forgetting to take the pill at the same time everyday, and missed 2 days, so I followed the directions on the pack and took it as soon as I remembered, or took 2 at the same time. On the 27th or the 28th of May, I noticed a brown, sticky discharge when I wiped and now today it is more like brown spotting. I have read sites where this is a big sign of pregnancy.

With birth control pills, even if he did ejaculate inside your vagina, the chances are very slim of pregnancy.  If you haven't had your withdrawal bleed when you feel you should have, take a home pregnancy test.  They are quite reliable within about a week after you miss your \"period\".  There are other reasons women frequently miss periods so try not to worry too much.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Christine, Ongoing bleeding is not a typical sign of pregnancy.  You did not mention if you are on any kind of birth control, which of course would decrease your risk considerably.    Bleeding can be hormonal, caused by trauma to the tissues from rough sex or from infection so it is good to have it checked out.  If you are on oral contraceptives, this could need adjustment or a different prescription.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Of course there is about a 1% chance of pregnancy while on the pill so if you suspect that, take a pregnancy test but if negative, don't worry about not having a period - these are not true periods anyway, but actually withdrawal bleeds when the hormone is stopped for a week.

    "content": "Hello, Your chances of pregnancy are just about like anyone's - it's kind of luck of the draw.  But, the fact that you noticed discharge on your panties does not mean you lost sperm.  Hundreds or thousands of sperm are released and it only takes one for pregnancy.  The seminal fluid is also present, as well as your normal vaginal discharge so leaking of fluid is not at all uncommon but it is completely unrelated to pregnancy achievement.  Most fertile couples having regular intercourse are able to become pregnant within the year but not necessarily when they plan for it, even when they accurately predict the day of ovulation. Sometimes the egg just isn't fertilized.    When sperm is deposited deep in the vagina, they start swimming upward toward the cervix.  If all goes well, a sperm meets up with the egg, fertilization occurs and then implantation.  As the embryo develops you get signs of pregnancy due to hormones (hcg) but even then, the pregnancy can be lost if implantation does not work out or there are chromosomal abnormalities that cause the fetus to stop developing.  It's a matter of patience to see what happens.   Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "To Damaris, Pregnancy under these circumstances would be quite unusual but there is the possibility that there could be leaking of seminal fluid that could be present when he penetrated you, and there is a remote chance of pregnancy.  If in doubt, do a test if you miss your period.  To rl2010, You would have been in the safe zone when pregnancy would not likely occur.  It does happen, though rarely.  Starting with your first menstrual day, the usual period of fertility is somewhere between days 9 and 18 so I would guess that you missed it.  Try to relax at this point since emotional stress and worry can interfere with your cycle and provide another cause of a missed period.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I have been on birth control now for more than six years. I originally went on it for irregular periods. I now get my period pretty regularly, and if it is late I will usually get it by the 4th day of the sugar pills. My last period was 5 days early, which has never hapened to me before. Now I am 11 days late for my period. My boyfriend and I use condoms, but the few times we have not, we use the \"pull out\" method. I did have the flu a month and a half ago and was on Tamaflu, but other than that I have not taken any medications. I have taken 2 pregnancy tests and they have both come back negative. I do not really believe I could be pregnant, but I don't know why else my period would be late. It seems like I have been more tired than usual, but that is the only symptom, other than the late period, that I have been reading about. Do I have a reason to worry? Thanks for any advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Here's my story. I had sex with a girl who's only 14 years old (and this was her first time) and I was not wearing a condom. And yes, I was aware of pre-ejaculation. But since I had no condom, I pulled out every time I ejaculated. Yes, every time, which means I put it back in and ejaculated about two times I believe, but not in her. I'm pretty sure, though, some of the sperm cells had went in her. Might I also add that this happened about two to two and a half weeks before her next period. It happened on the 14th of Decemeber and she's told me her next period was either the end of December or the beginning of January. So, I just want to get an estimate of the chances of her being pregnant. Can someone PLEASE help me out.\n\n",

Christmas night, I had an encounter with a guy where a bit of his semen was on my thumb.  I laid my hand on his pant leg afterward and maybe 5-10 minutes later went to the bathroom, used the facilities and upon wiping, my thumb accidentally touched my clitoris (by now the semen seemed nearly dry on my thumb).  I washed my hands after and then later (maybe 4 hrs later) took a shower and pretty much scrubbed myself pink.  Any chance of pregnancy with my thumb touching my clitoris if it has dried/drying semen on it?  THERE WAS NO PENETRATION...I don't trust anyone enough to have intercourse.\n\n",

I have not been sexually active since the middle of December and have regular periods on my birth control(Ocella) since then, until this month, February. I was suppose to have had my period about a week ago because that was when I was on my sugar pills, but I didn't and had very little to no spotting even. I was wondering if this meant I may be pregnant and what should I do? Please give me some insight as to why I may have missed my period this month but not last month after I had had intercourse?

I have not done that this time and i had my last period starting Wed June 23 ending Sun June 27 and it is now July 10 and i had the brown color thats before the red of your period has come today, and its quite heavy. I have  no idea what is going on because this has never happened before.   Although i did do something different this time, not on purpose just happened.  On June 10 my boyfriend had hernia surgery and needed to recover so we havent had sex, but starting last friday we have had sex twice daily til today.  On the 3rd sugar pill of my pack is when my period starts (everytime for 5 yrs) - june 17 is when i stopped taking the pill and missed like 4 or 5 of them. so when i realized that i had missed them i just took 2 then just threw everything else out. (don't no why i took 2 i just wasnt thinking)  So im really worried that its either 1 of 2 1- that i messed up my pills therefore it messed up my period  or 2- that because i mixed them up that me and my bf having sex with out protection actually got me pregnant?  very confused and would love some help with this please.\n\n",

    "content": "My husband ( 39yrs old) and I (23 yrs. Old) were recently married, June 26th 2010. We are trying to conceive. I was on the pill for awhile, but went off it in February of this year.  I went on the pill mainly to try to keep my cycles regular, and succeeded. Now that I have been off, I\u2019m back to my irregular cycles. I had a period in Feb, March, and the middle of June. My husband and I had unprotected sex a few days before our wedding, and pretty consistently the week after.  My most recent period was from June 13-18. I am not sure when I ovulate, as I have irregular cycles and never had much luck with the ovulation predictor kits. But the 4/5th of July, when I went to the bathroom and wiped, there was a brown discharge on my toilet paper, that I guess would refer to spotting. So, I used a tampon expecting my period to come, woke up the next morning, and other than a little bit of that brown substance, nothing else was on it. It is now the 14th, and still nothing (granted that I\u2019m never sure when my next period will start). I\u2019ve also had all the symptoms of what I believe to be pregnancy\u2026. Cramps, bloating, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, mood swings, backache, just \u201cfeeling\u201d pregnant, sore breasts with blue veins running across\u2026. Etc. I also know that these signs might also be signs of pre-period, as I sometimes get these \u2018symptoms\u2019 without ever getting my period(it normally skips a month or two; at least). But its been about a week and a half of these symptoms, and they never normally last this long. I have taken several pregnancy tests, all coming back negative. Is there a chance I may be pregnant, or is it just wishful thinking (because I\u2019m never sure when the next period will start). Should I test again with the at home tests, get blood work done, and when? Any advice will be appreciated, its all so confusing!\n\n",

A year back i was given clomid and no follicle study was done and i missed my period almost for 2 mnths, almost buldged to double m size, pregnancy negative, and i was given provera to get my periods. Before taking clomid i used to have irregular periods may be a week early or so. Then again i was asked to take clomid but no test was done and again no preg and took provera to get my periods this happened for almost 4 mnths.  Then i flew to India and this month i was put on siphene and asked to go for a follicle study. 10th day the endro was 5.8mm, 12th day 11mm and triple line then on 14th day the doc said there is no change so we wont continue with the study this time. So does this mean i wont ovulate this month or is there a chance that my follicle might grow further like say on 16th day. My last cycle was of 31 days.   What treatment do you think i should be going for.  I am even having a bad lower back pain which usually increases if i walk or stand for long.  Please help\n\n",

I am now 4 years post transplant with a creatnine of 1.5- 1.9. I am trying to get pregnant with no success. I did have a 10cm multioculated cyst on my right ovary  about 5 months ago but it resolved itself. Recent ultrasound and cat-scan were unremarkable. My uterus is flexible with manual exam.  Biopsy of my endometrium was consistent with day 24-25 if a 28 day cycle.  My menstrual cycle is normal and I do ovulate.  I am currently on Prednisone 5mg, Prograf 3mg and lopressor for HBP. Could my scarring be so bad that it may have physically impaired my ability to conceive? I do have a family background (mother and sister) with endometriosis. I know no one here can  give me actual diagnosis- I am  just looking for some insight or anyone else that may have had a similar experience?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello!  About a month ago, June 22, I had my wisdom teeth removed. I had just finished my period prior to this. I was VERY stressed out about the surgery, and had been taking a weeks worth of Clyndamicin for an infection I had related to my wisdom teeth. After the surgery, I took a weeks worth of Ciprofloxacin (the first medication didn't work) and frequently took Vicodin for about a week. All that being said, I know stress can affect menstrual cycles and that certainly was very stressful for me, mentally and physically.  My period is now a week later than expected, and although I had expected some delay from all this, I'm still paranoid that I'm pregnant. My boyfriend and I had sex with a condom and we were pretty sure I was ovulating, so we tried to be careful. About a week after that, we figured I was done and had unprotected sex (pullout method), but now I'm really worried I could be pregnant.  So my question is, are the chances that I'm pregnant high, or could I perhaps be so late from all the stress I had near the beginning of the month? I've heard stories about people being as late as three weeks being put \"under\" for surgery, and I'm wondering if perhaps the same thing is happening to me.\n\n",

    "content": "On Monday July 19, 2010 my girlfriend and I were partaking in foreplay.  We had showered together and then proceeded to partake in the foreplay in my room. We were both nude and fear that pre-ejaculate may be a factor in a possible pregnancy specifically because I had masturbated an hour to an hour and a half before and hadn't urinated before the foreplay. Our genitals were rubbing together and were very close to penetration but penetration never occurred. She had taken \"Next Choice\" emergency contraceptive approximately 18 hours after the activities.  She has an irregular period, and feels that her last one began around June 26th.  After using a ovulation calculator we estimate that there is a possibility that she could have been ovulating when she came in contact with the pre-ejaculate but we don't think she was on her most fertile day.  She does not know when her next period is, our best estimate is 2-2.5 weeks.  Can anyone enlighten us on the possibility of her being pregnant? I've heard sperm can live in the urethra after masturbation without urination afterward, but does the situation really call for as much worry as we're putting into it?\n\n",

So try not to worry too much about this encounter.  Having also taken emergency contraceptives it is extremely unlikely pregnancy could have occurred.  It might be good for you to discuss birth control methods to avoid future scares and need for such strong hormones which will likely further disturb her cycles.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It is also possible that it is too early to detect pregnancy since people vary in the amount of hormone that shows up.  If your period doesn't start, I would repeat the test a week after the first.  You could also get a serum test (blood) through a doctor's office.  These are a little more sensitive.    You might want to consider a hormonal contraceptive for regular use (the pill, patch or shot).  It would certainly be better than wondering each time you have sex.  For sexually transmitted disease concerns you could also use condoms, but having the hormonal method would give peace of mind about possible pregnancy for the times you might not choose to use those.  It is not perfect (no method is) but it is pretty reliable (98-99% effective when used properly).  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "since my last post i've done a little more  research. I found 2 things. 1- many women who take plan b find their 2nd period after taking the pill to be late. And 2-you are more fertile BEFORE ovulation then during (  I had unprotected sex DURING). So after reading this I figured that it is most likely to be the pill that is causing my period to be late. But this brings me to a new question which I can't seem to get a straight answer to. Will i still ovulate on schedule as if i had gotten my period or lets just say i get my period a week late will it be around 14 days from then? And I also still need to know best time to retest. Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your kind words.  The problem is this - only a small percentage of women actually ovulate on the predicted 14th day.  We actually refer to a fertile window that comprises several possible days for conception to occur and since you are fertile a few days prior to the actual ovulation, it is very hard to predict.  Also, after taking hormonal contraception, it is impossible to say when your next fertile time will be.  It would most likely be related to the period, counting from then, but I must emphasize that this is only a guesstimate.    A large study reported in the British Medical Journal found that only 30% of women actually ovulate during this predictable \"fertile window.\" 70% ovulated either before or after this time frame.    So, we can say day 14 is the expected ovulation day, but that is just for convenience in dating pregnancy should it occur - it has little to do with the actual ovulation.  That is the reason they have ovulation predictor kits, etc.  We just can't reliably count 14 days and call it good.  It's kind of a gamble if you use this date to plan a pregnancy or prevent one.  It's no more than a likely time, but based on this study, it's probably wrong more often than it is right.  It puts you in the ballpark but that's about it.  Let us know how it goes.  We would be interested in hearing from your mom and finding out her area of expertise.  Thanks.\n\n",

That would give you an estimated due date of July 19 or 20.  Keep in mind the operative word here is \"estimated\" since we don't know exactly when conception occurred and this is not just in your case.  These days almost everyone gets an ultrasound which can confirm gestation and help you determine if this date is the most accurate.  Be patient about a date since they are not definitive anyway.

    "content": "To happykid71 -   It often takes several years for periods to become regular, if they do at all. You can be very normal and not ever have regular, predictable cycles.  If you are sexually active, you should be concerned about the possibility of pregnancy.  If not, this is definitely within the normal limits.  You may not yet be ovulating every month. When the time comes that you wish to conceive, you can have this evaluated.  Otherwise try not to stress over it since that alone can delay your period.  But, your health does not depend on having a regular menstrual cycle.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Irregular periods are considered quite normal for most women.  Nothing you have reported here is alarming and there is not enough information to guess at whether or not you are pregnant.  But, why guess when home pregnancy tests are easy to obtain?  Many women begin to have period irregularity as they age, particularly in the peri-menopause which can occur years before menopause.  You are not that old but the cycle alterations can happen at any time.  It really isn't important for you to completely predict your cycles unless you are trying to conceive or using natural family planning.    Continue to chart your periods and when you see your doctor for your annual exam, having this history will be helpful.  Of course there ia always the possibility of an underlying hormone or other problem so if this continues to be erratic your doctor might be able to help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The levels vary from woman to woman and it depends on when in the cycle this one occurred.  I would say this would be a low level and a good pregnancy outcome is usually associated with higher levels (>8).  If you do need supplementation this would begin right away once you become pregnant so you need to be in touch with your doctor as you try to conceive.  If you have experienced losses in the past that you suspect may be related to low progesterone, this would be especially important.   The frequency of your periods usually relates to when you ovulate so you probably ovulate earlier than the 14th day of the cycle.    I hope this answers your question.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a little unclear on this question.  I am not familiar with \"the Big E\" and if you are talking about Rh factor, it's the negative mom who has concerns since her baby could be positive and that creates a potential problem if the baby's and mom's blood should mix at birth or through trauma.  A negative mom receives a rhogam injection before the end of the pregnancy and again following delivery if the baby is positive.  If your daughter is Rh positive she does not have the Rh factor.    However, if you mean that she has already been sensitized following the birth of another child (or miscarriage, abortion) that is another story.  If you have information about this, it would be helpful.  The term would be Rh sensitization.  I am wondering if this is what is meant by the Rhs you mention.  Usually the Rh factor (quite common) is just that, without the \"s\" so I'm a bit confused.    Let us know if this does not answer your question.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I had sexual contact on 31st of May, we were not using contraception but we did not have penetrative sex (I am a virgin if this makes a difference). However, after reading some stories on the internet about pre-ejaculatory fluids and pregnancy, I am really worried. The head of his penis may have touched briefly around the outside of my vagina.    I think that I ovulated on 2nd June. My last period was on 14th May, I was expecting my next period around 16th June. However, I started bleeding on 4th June - just faint patches in my pants for a start. However, on 5th June it became quite heavy like a normal period - blood was some brown and some bright red. This is my 3rd day like a normal period now but I am still worried about pregnancy after reading about implantation spotting.  I am stressed due to this and exams in the coming week however, I have only ever been late on a period due to stress before. Please can someone get back to me, I would really like some answers so that I don't affect my exams too badly.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is true that pre-ejaculate can contain sperm, but it does require penetration to get it to the area where any sperm present could travel to the egg.  This is a somewhat complicated process and if the fluid was only on the outside you would not be pregnant.  Try not to worry about this.  Variation in periods at time is completely normal.  The fact that you are bleeding like a period is evidence that you are not pregnant.  Implantation bleeding is usually light and again, would require intercourse and conception in order for it to occur.   The time you would worry about pre-ejaculate is if you were using the \"pull-out\" method of birth control where he pulls out before he ejaculates.  The risk is that some of the fluid could still be present in the vagina, but the key is that there has been penetration in that case.  You will gain peace of mind if you are prepared with contraception in case you get this close again and perhaps get carried away in your passion, resulting in a lack of self-control.  Abstinence is the best prevention of pregnancy but sometimes people slip up so it's good to be prepared.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have now had cramping pains in my lower abdomen area for the last 4 days or so, is this all in my mind do you think!? I don't have any other pregnancy symptoms like tender breasts or anything... just the cramping. Also, I was due a period in the next week or so, but I had what I think was one starting on the 5th like I said, so should I still expect one.. if I miss this one in the coming week should I worry or did I simply have it early!? thank you so much!\n\n",

I read something from a doctor that said if you are between the ages of 12-18, it's normal to have a irregular period, also it's very unlikely without penetration pre-cum could get to you cervix.\n\n",

I got the 2nd condom on, but whilst having sex it broke - I pulled out quickly and had not ejaculated. I put a 3rd condom on, but I pulled out pretty soon after as I was nervous it would also split. Apart from the shaky 1st time (!), what are the chances of my girlfriend being pregnant due to that 2nd condom splitting? She is not on the pill and has not taken the morning after pill. I did not ejaculate through any of this.  Thanks for your time..\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is important to be sure you have quality condoms.  Breakage is often related to the original quality.  In the USA, the CDC recommends using only latex male condoms; those with a latex allergy, should use polyurethane condoms since they provide STD and pregnancy protection comparable to latex. While other non-latex synthetics provide a level of pregnancy protection that is similar to latex condoms, too, they are more likely to break or slip.  As for chances of pregnancy, the answer is not simple.  Your girlfriend has a few days each month when she is fertile, near the time of ovulation.  If you are outside that window, the chances would be very slim that she would become pregnant.  However, if she is ovulating and some sperm was released (pre-cum) even without ejaculation the odds would increase.  Still, without ejaculating, the chances are much less than if you had done so.  I hope this makes sense.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The RH factor only is a problem when the mother is Rh Negative; not positive.  I am not sure what to advise since it appears we need more information.  Is it another condition besides Rh disease?    If you are actually negative and you had a child with positive blood without receiving rhogam within 72 hours of the delivery or loss, your blood antibodies could attack a future pregnancy with a positive baby.  In this case the pregnancy is considered high risk but with close monitoring, interventions such as blood transfusions can often resolve the problem, resulting in a healthy delivery, though sometimes they must be delivered early and of course this comes with additional risks.  Testing should be fairly accurate about 2 weeks after conception or around the time one would expect the period to be starting.  Follow the directions on the package for accurate results.  If negative, this could be a false reading so the test is repeated if your periods has not begun yet by then.  If you have more information we may be able to help you some more.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You should probably consult with a doctor for more information because there are many blood conditions.  However, the most common one relating to pregnancy is the Rh factor.  If you have negative blood, your body can make antibodies to positive blood.  So, if you were to conceive a child with positive blood type and some minute blood was exchanged at delivery, you could make antibodies that could attack future positive babies.  However, if this was the case, you should have been given RhoGam to counteract this problem and prevent the antibodies from being a problem in the future.  It is possible they did this and were advising you to be certain that any future pregnancies are also followed up with RhoGam (miscarriage, abortion, or delivery) within 72 hours of the event.    They may have wanted to emphasize to you that not getting this could put future babies at risk. Your doctor can determine your blood type if you don't know it and help you understand your health concerns.  If it is not Rh factor, the doctor can also either review the previous records (if you give permission for them to be sent) or do an exam with lab work to find out.  It is always a good idea to have regular gynecological exams.  I would recommend this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My question is how long to we have to wait before trying again? My doctor says 3 months but I think that seems like a long wait especially since i had no complications and it was more or less a very heavy period with cramping. Time is not on my side as I am 38 years old. I want to hurry and try again but my husband is worried if we do it wil happen again. This is his first baby where as I have already had 7 children. Please can someone tell me why I should wait or if we even have to at all?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible to become pregnant during the woman's period but it only happens rarely.  I'd say this combined with the negative test suggests she is not pregnant.  There are, however, many reasons women are sometimes late on their periods, including stress (over being pregnant even).  Hormones fluctuate and are not consistent throughout the month unless she is taking birth control pills that artificially regulate this.  It is unusual for women to never have this type of irregularity at least at times when not using the Pill.  So, just because she has only been late once before doesn't really mean anything.  This may be the second time and there will likely be even more in the future.    If she doesn't get her period by then, she should repeat the pregnancy test a week after the first one or she could get a serum (blood) test which is more sensitive, if she must know for sure.      Good luck to you both.\n\n",

It is extremely unlikely you are pregnant and if you were, you would not have these symptoms so soon.  Yes, you do need to wait until your period is due for a test but you should relax because it really would be a rare event and stress can delay your period, adding to your stress, further delaying your period and making you crazy.  Having sex on your period is one of the safest times so even with missed pills, this would be unlikely.  Then taking plan B pretty much takes care of any slight risk.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I don't like condoms and I know that my BF and I are clean, we both have been to the doctors together to be fully screened for any STD's. Moving on... So Thursday the 16th we were having a fun night, doing a little drinking and he got a little carried away and released inside. That next morning we did it again but this time he pulled out but said he thought he may have gotten a little inside. I went to my sister who is taking the pill, (but sais it was a lower dose because she is nursing) I got 2 BC pills from her, I am not sure what kind they were but because I kept forgetting I didn't take the first one until 2am on Saturday and then took the second one at 2pm that same day. I was told by a RN that if you take 2 BC pills it is the same as the plan B pill, and because I cannot afford the plan B I did this in hopes that this would prevent pregnancy.     I wouldn't mind it if I did become pregnant at all, and my bf feels te same way, if it happens then it happens. That thursday night on the 16th I started my period. I was having bad cramps that night along with some slightly heavy bleeding. Then the next thre day it was very light, to the point where I didn't even need to wear a tampon. I had a docs appt thatmonday and told the doc what had happened and she said I shouldn't have anything to worry about but she ordered a blood test for me and said I could come in any time I wanted to take it. It has been 10 days since then, I have noticed some slight headachs that come and go. I have been keeping track of how often I have to use the restroom and I have it down to about 3-4 times in the middle of the night. I was having minor crams yesterday but nothing today, I did see verry little spotting in my panties but was too faint to really be sure. I have been getting some abdominal discomfort from time to time and last night and this morning I have been getting heart burn. I know there is a slim chance of getting pregnant while on your period but how good would my chances be? Could I be pregnant right now?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You're right that the chances of pregnancy are slim on your period and cramping is not a typical early pregnancy symptom.  It can be a symptom of a bladder infection or UTI, especially with the frequency of urination.  You should be checked for this.    As for the emergency contraception - the pills vary in strength so if regular oral contraceptives are used as plan B, you should discuss the particular pill and dosage with your doctor.  You are correct that some brands can be reliable when used this way.    Better still would be to find another form of birth control you are comfortable with so  you don't have to worry so much.  If you didn't like the effect that the pill had on your body, chances are you would like even less the effects of plan B.    Best wishes.\n\n",

I should also add that ever since I was a little girl and because I was sexualy assulted as a child I have always had frequent urination. There isnt ever any pain present when I go just that I have to go a lot. The doctor passed it off as me being OCD. It wasn't until later that I found out that when I took the 2 pills as a plan B that I did some homework on line and found out that exactly what you said. There was a chart I came across that tells you based on what kind of pill you were taking tepends on the dosage, with that being said it would most likley have been ineffective. So that brings me back to that same question, in your proffessional opinion do you think I am pregnant? Again I thank you for your responce ad for taking out the time to answer my post I know you are a very busy woman. Thanks, have a great day\n\n",

    "content": "Well, long story short. My bf and I have been together for about three months now and I don't make him use a condom but I have been on bc for over two years now. We have had sex before, during, and after my period but tried to be extra careful and I would always take my pills on time. It was over a month ago, I started feeling nausious every time I ate. I passed it off as stress, since I have had that happen before. But then I started getting tired in the middle of my shift at work, which never happened, about three weeks later I started have these light cramps like I was about to start but I wasn't supposed to start for another two weeks, and I noticed I was bloating. That is when I finally decided that there could be something going on. Keep in mind that I have a rather fertial family and most of the females in my family have had atleast one child while on bc, I know I should have kept that in mind when I wasn't making him use protection. Well, here I am now two weeks after my missed period and still bloated, my breasts are even more tender than usual, I am using the bathroom more often than usual, I eat more often than usual, and still have the fatigue. I have taken a HPT but it came up not preg. That is another thing that runs in my family, neg tests. I was just wondering if this is all in my head or could I actually be pregnant? I have a doctors appointment this friday but I was just trying to get a little more advice before I waist the time of going. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you have a wonderful day.\n\n",

The best thing is to have the doctor or clinic do a serum (blood) test which is more sensitive, but often, just repeating the tests weekly, as long as there is no period, usually will eventually show positive as the hcg levels rise.

I suspect the strong hormones you received with plan B have altered your cycles and it can take a few months for things to regulate again.

We didn't use a condom and he ejaculated inside. The next morning we got a plan B and I've taken. So that would be today. I'm worried what are the chances of me getting pregnant? Also I got my wisdom teeth out so I have been taking Amoxicillian and Ibuprofen 800s. I heard that it can lower your chances of it working. So I haven't taken any medication today; the day that I've taken the plan B. My second question is how long should I wait to start taking that medication?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If you had your period after unprotected sex, particularly after taking emergency contraception, you are most likely not pregnant from that encounter.  If you have since had unprotected sex, that is another matter.  It is very common to miss periods occasionally and nothing to worry about.  If you did have sex since then and your period is late, it makes sense to take a home pregnancy test.    Stress can cause your period to be late, as can hormonal fluctuation that is part of a woman's reproductive cycle.  Very few women are always regular with their periods.  Best wishes.\n\n",

These are not regulated and tested in the same way as other drugs so we cannot say if there will be any detrimental effects or not.  However, most women respond best to other methods to increase arousal and interest.  The emotions and relationship issue have a large effect on her.  About 40% of women report a disappointing level of sexual arousal.  There is research being done to try and find a safe and effective women's libido enhancer but it is not here yet.  I would advise caution about what you read on the internet and are sold.  If you meet with an herbalist, you might get some help but they may not know the interactions with other prescription drugs.

    "content": "Hi Doctors, thank you so much for this sight. Reading other things i had questions on was very helpful.  But this question is very pressing and has been worrying me sick. On the 31st of May my Boyfriend an i had protected sex but he had soon told me after that something had gone wrong with the condom when he put it on. (but it wasn't broken) something to the sorts of his semen may have gotten on the outside of the condom.  Up until the 31st i had every pms symptom, bloating, sore breasts, ect and a day after the 1st of June i got what i thought was my period on time. We ended up having protected sex once more after that. My period however only lasted 4 days and was very light which is not normal . (I usually last 6-7 days and am fairly heavy.) I thought it was over after the 4 days. What was weird was that I had no bleeding for a full day and then that night i bleed heavy and then very light for the next two days. It has stopped now. So i had blood for about 7 days but SUPER irregular.   Im very confused and concerned. Could the irregular bleeding be due to implantation that i may have gotten pregnant? I have no early signs of being pregnant yet however. Should i take a pregnancy test, and if so when? Your help is greatly appreciated! Thank you SO much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It sounds like you had a normal period, even though it was not a typical period for you.  Most women experience times now and again when their cycles are a bit \"off\" and it's nothing to be concerned about.    If you want to take a pregnancy test, these are usually reliable around the time of your expected period or a few days after.  Somewhere between 10 and 20 days after conception the test should work but this varies with the individual and hcg levels can be slow to show up in some cases.  This being the case, you should be able to test sometime this coming week based on May 31 being the day you had sex with questionable protection.  But again, since you bled pretty well after that episode I really don't think you are not pregnant.    Irregularity of periods is not usually cause for alarm regarding pregnancy, but missed periods are a sign.  Implantation occurs about a week or so after conception and if there is bleeding with that it is usually light.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The scan should be quite reliable so it sounds like you need a better explanation of exactly what was seen so try to schedule a consultation appointment with your doctor to discuss the findings.  If this is not possible or even by choice to give you more confidence, seek a second opinion so you know what your options are and you won't have unrealistic expectations.    If it is confirmed that you cannot have a child naturally, you can still find great joy in adoption so you may want to start the process - at least learn about it, check out some online support groups where you can talk to other adoptive parents about their experience.  You could also consider becoming a foster parent, which can lead to adoption options after you are able to see how you feel in loving even an older child.  Another rarer and expensive option would be surrogate motherhood where another woman bears a child for you, using your own egg and sperm from your husband, resulting in your own genetic offspring.    But, if you are able to adjust to the idea of adoption, you may find it to be the wonderful experience you are hoping for; just a different pathway to that joy.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "hi, i i went to see a chinese herbal lady and she checked my pulse and my tongue and said i had a cold womb? I have heavy periods and blood clots for the first 2/3 days of my period, my periods are 26 to 28days normally and i have severe cramps etc. She said my womb was cold and thats why the blood clots where trying to come out. She gave me some herbal small tablets to take for the next two weeks. It makes sense what she was telling me, as me and my husband have been trying to conceive for the past year now, and have been unsucessful. Do you think its because i have a cold womb and the wrong temperature for the embryo to grow?  Look forward to your reply, 24 years old/female.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm afraid I am not trained in Chinese herbal medicine so I really cannot advise you on this.  Cold uterus is a term I am not familiar with.  I know that alternative medicine such as herbal therapy can be helpful in many cases but my training is in traditional medicine and this is a diagnosis in Chinese medicine.  Along with the treatment your herbalist has prescribed, morning hours (if not too stressful) are the optimal time for conception to occur.  According to this, you should try to decrease your stress and plan intercourse for the morning hours if possible.  If your evenings are less stressful, however, that might be better since stress can counter your efforts.  Clotting and heavy menstrual flow are both considered normal and many women experience this even in absence of any fertility issues.  Best of luck in your efforts.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,To make sure that indeed a person is azoospermic centifugation of the semen sample  may be required.Also even if there are some sperms, they can be used for Intra cytoplsmic Sperm Injection ICSI, if it is indicated. Hormonal testing for FSH FollicleStimulatingHormone levels will give an idea as to the azoospermia is of obstructive or the non obstructive type if indeed if it is present.Also the presence of few sperms by examining the pellet would rule out ductal obstruction.Also if there is a low volume ejaculate retrograde ejaculation needs to be ruled out.Tests like vasography may be required to rule out ductal obsruction.Testicular biopsy is advised to assess testicular sperm production in nonobstructive types. Typically a man with nonobstructive type would present with  a small testes and a flat epididymis with a typically elevated serum FSH and normal testosterone.A definitive diagnosis of NOA is with a testicular biopsy.

    "content": "My fiancee, a 34 y/o male had a vasectomy performed 8 years ago in which he was recently told that they removed one whole inch of the vas deferens on each side. We would like to have the vasectomy reversed and are very concerned and confused by all the conflicting research we've found.  Some doctors state that the time elapsed since the vasectomy and the amount of vas deferens left are significant factors in the likelihood of a successful reversal while others say with new microscopic technology that the factors do not play an important role in how successful a reversal will be, such as this doc's website http://www.infertile.com/treatmnt/treats/mvr/mvr.htm. I guess I am trying to clear the confusion so we have a realisitc view of what we will be facing when it comes time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

In general, with previous techniques, reversal of a vasectomy was possible but even under ideal circumstances there was still a significant chance of failure.

If it is late, it is probably stress related, because if you worry you are pregnant, you tend to cause your period to be late, causing more worry.....  But, if you would like to ease your fears, if your period does not come when it is due, then go to a clinic and take a test, but I really feel you have nothign to worry about, and I am sure your period will come when it is due. You are worried about pre ejaculate, which can cause pregnancy, but, in your case, the sperm would have to travel through 3 sets of clothing, find yoru vagina, swim up the vaginal canal, (in the off chance you were ovulationg at the time) find the egg and fertilize it. Since you had your period a few days eariler, it woudl be unlikely you were ovulating at the time anyway,.  You also mentioned that your period a few days eariler was lighter than usual. This would have nothing to due with being pregnant now, unless you had another sexual encounter the month prior. Also, the symptoms you are worried about....typically a woman who is pregnant would not have symptoms so soon after becomming pregnant. You may have a bladder infection, which is causing the frequent urination.\n\n",

It would not occur 4 days after the sexual contact.  Implantation bleeding is rare, most women do not experience it.

You should try not to worry so much about this, because you may delay your period, and that would cause you to worry even more.  Tell me the dates of the period before you had this encounter with yoru boyfriend, and I will see if it was even a fertile time for you. You can take a home pregnancy test if you want, but it would not be accurate if it is to soon.   I really suggest you try not to worry, and wait for your period to come, because I am sure it will. The probability of you getting pregnant this way is next to zero.  I also suggest that even though your not sexually active, since you are worrying about pregnancy, you make an appintment to see about some birth control, just to ease your mind from worrying about this in the future, even if you do not plan on having sex.\n\n",

    "content": "The good news - you probably weren't fertile during that time anyway. Based on an average cycle, you wouldn't ovulate until later on in the month.  Its not a gaurantee of course, but hopefully this information will help lower your worry a little until your period comes.  Think about this. During normal sex, with intercourse, and a man ejaculated into the woman, he releases millions of sperm. Only one single sperm makes it into the egg,. Most die on the way there, it is a long swim. In your case,  there wasnt even a full ejaculation(assuming he even did have a little pre ejaculate), so that is even less amount of sperm. The sperm had to make it through 3 different layers of clothing, find your vagina, make it all the way up and find a fertilized egg.......it would be a miracle if even one sperm could make it that far. Most likely they would all die on the way. It would even be a remote chance the sperm could survive through all the clothing, let alone find and enter your vagina.  Your worry is going to cause yrou period to be late, which will cause more worry, and every twinge you feel in your stomache, every time you urinate, every headache...all normal feelings you will believe to be a pregnancy sign. Most women do not even have any symptoms yet.  Assume you did get pregnant, you would only be 1 week pregnant according to the date of your last period. Implantation dosen't occur until the third week of pregnancy. usually around the time your next period is due.  Hopefully, this information will ease your mind a little. The chance of pregnancy for you is soo tiny i have been searching for an exact stastic, but I cannot even find one.   Please try not to worry so much, your period will come, I am confident everything will be fine.\n\n",

I just became concerned when I was researching it and I read that if the pre-cum gets through your clothes you can become pregnant. And I'm pretty sure that there was a high chance it went through my clothes. But even if it did go through my clothes its pretty rare for me to be pregnant right?\n\n",

    "content": "How can you be pretty sure it went through your clothes when you don't even know if there was any pre ejaculate present or not? Yes, pregnancy can occur with pre ejaculte, and yes, it can travel through clothes. Possbile pregnancy would occur if only the guy had on boxers, girl naked, and his penis was near or slightly inside her vagina through the boxers.  In your case, there was 3 layers of clothing.  But to answer your question, if he did have pre ejaculate, and it did happen to travel all through the clothing, it still had to make its way into your vagina and find an egg. And you were probably not even ovulating at the time. At which pregnancy could not occur even if you had sex and he ejaculated inside you. No, your still probably safe. No worries.\n\n",

    "content": "I apologize for not responding quickly. I haven't been able to get to the computer much this weekend.  I am not sure what more I can offer you.  Yes, it is possible to become pregnant from pre ejaculation, however the risk is small, and with layers of clothing the risk goes down even further, and since the time of ovulation doesn't corespond with the time of the sexual contact, the risk further goes down, however it is still possible. The best thing to do is wait until your period is due, and if it does not come, take a pregnancy test. There are early pregnancy tests that can be taken up to 5 days before a missed period, but they may give you a false negative. Blood tests at the doctors office are more accurate for early testing, but the most accurate way to test is after a missed period. Unfortunatly, the best thing for you to do is wait it out until your period is due.  If you have any more questions, feel free to ask me, but please understand I am not always able to answer the same day.   Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The period irregularity is likely the result of the strong hormones you used with plan B.  If you are worried, take a pregnancy test.  These are usually reliable a couple of weeks after conception should pregnancy have occurred (the time of the sexual activity in question).  It can take a few months for your periods to get back to \"normal\" following this procedure (plan B) so don't be surprised if you continue to have irregularity for a while.  Best wishes.\n\n",

However, miscarriage rate is quite high in the early weeks of pregnancy so certainly this could happen.  I'm afraid at this point it's a matter of wait and see.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is very unlikely you would be pregnant.  The start of your period is usually an indication that you are NOT pregnant.  Having missed one period, but getting it the next month would not indicate pregnancy now.  There are some cases where women have periods - usually not a \"normal\" period - even though they are pregnant but this is the exception rather than the rule.  If you are not ready for parenthood, I would suggest finding a method of birth control you can both live with.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Assuming you have no other fertility problems in addition to the single tube, your chances of achieving pregnancy are excellent.  Typically you release an egg from one ovary on alternating months and sometimes more than one egg is released (as in the case of naturally occurring fraternal twins.  It only takes one egg being fertilized to start a baby.  Even in cases with no issues at all, it is considered normal for it to take a year to get pregnant when trying to conceive.  So, you are well within the normal limits.  Just because we try for a particular time does not mean it will happen.  There is a certain amount of luck involved and we often get the babies when they are ready; rather than when we think we are.  You can try some tricks such as monitoring your fertile days to be sure you are having intercourse during that period - usually it is recommended every other day if you're up to it and if you have a normal cycle, that is usually day 8 through day 19 when you start counting on the first day of your period.  You can also sometimes notice a change in your vaginal secretions - if you do, that would be a good time to have sex.  Try to be patient.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Ms. Miller,   I have taken 3 pregnancy tests since I last posted. They all read negative. It has now neen 55 days since the start of my last period. Should I expect my period to start again this month or is it possible that I could miss it for a longer duration? I feel like I am gaining weight, but its the Holidays, so it could be from food. My breasts are feeling strange; I get sharp pains in them if I run / lay on / touch them to hard. I don't know... I am 33 years old and this is the first time I missed my period so I'm a bit confused as to what it could be.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I know this is very frustrating to you.  In most women the results of the pregnancy test are reliable, especially after taking several of them.  But, occasionally a woman can be pregnant in spite of the negative tests due to insufficient hCG hormones that trigger the positive result.    It is also possible you could have a hormonal problem that is preventing you from ovulating - not just the tube obstruction concern.  Since you are hoping for pregnancy, I would suggest seeing a doctor about your missed periods.  The doctor can do a serum (blood) pregnancy test which is more accurate and could also check some \"soft signs\" of pregnancy with a pelvic exam.  It would be good to find out why you are missing your period in any case.  Hormones are sometimes prescribed.  Good luck and best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "My husband and I are trying to get pregnant and my cycles are around 41 days (between 40 and 43 days). Now I'm wondering if this means something is wrong with me? I find lots of different \"answers\" online, some websites say that lots of women have long cycles and that nothing is wrong with that, while other websites advise to contact your doctor if your cycle is longer than 40 days...? Can you please tell me whether or not a 41 day cycle means I'm less fertile? I did pay attention to my discharge this last cycle and did notice a clear stretchy discharge which (in hindsight) occurred 14 days prior to my period, does this indicate I do in fact ovulate? I'm really worried about this... Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Yes, while 28 days is average, your cycle is within the normal range.  You just ovulate on a different schedule.  It is important to know your cycle length in determining your estimated due date since you would not necessarily ovulate at day 14, but as you noted, you likely did ovulate 14 days prior to your period - perfectly normal.  Obviously if you had become pregnant, dating by your prior period would give you a little earlier date.  Ultrasound dating helps verify in these cases so don't worry.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible for pregnancy to occur even with endometriosis and your best chances are in the months following the procedure.  Your best chances are to have sex regularly, especially during the days 8 through 19 of your cycle.  80% of women with endometriosis are able to conceive naturally.  Your doctor can also discuss therapies to possibly help such as ovulation stimulation medication (such as Clomid) and gonadatropin agonists (such as Lupron).  If you don't within the next 12 to 36 months you might consider assisted reproductive techniques, such as intrauterine insemination or in-vitro fertilization.   The good news is that your chances of conceiving are better than they have ever been due to modern medicine and once you become pregnant, your endometriosis symptoms usually disappear for the duration.  Good luck and best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: vasectomy and sperm questions",
    "content": "Hi, That pregnancies can occur post-vasectomy or post-tubectomy is well known.   Some of the causes of pregnancies in the post-vasectomy period are.... -  Unprotected intercourse during the immediate post-vasectomy period.  - recanalization of the vas - or other less common causes which can be called as 'method failure'.  A common recommendation for the post-vasectomy period is to have semen analysis performed 3 months after vasectomy or after 20 ejaculations and use temporary contraception or to avoid intercourse until azospermia is documented.   The time interval from vasectomy to azoospermia is incompletely characterized and may vary according to the vasectomy technique.Thus it is important for couples to understand that men are not sterile immediately after the procedure.  Although most vasectomy failures are said to occur relatively early (within 6 months of the procedure), some may occur more than a year after the vasectomy (most failures occurred within the first 2 years).   Vasectomy failures more than 2 years after vasectomy have also been reported.  Withdrawals before ejaculation are not an insurance against the risk of pregnancies.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chances of Pregnancy with low sperm motility",
    "content": "Hello, What you need to know is that the analysis helps to determine if sperm are a factor in infertility but even men with low counts and not good mobility still sometimes are successful in conception.  We don't know why this is so, but the things you can do to help your odds are the usual good health recommendations.  For you specifically, quit the tobacco altogether.  The combination of smoking and drinking are very bad for healthy sperm.  Obviously recreational drug use is also a no-no here.  Then, you should eat right (good healthy diet with lots of vegetables) exercise regularly, take a multivitamin and watch your weight.  Good overall health has been shown to improve the chances of good sperm.    Some men are also affected by prescription medications so if you take any for high blood pressure, etc., talk to your doctor.   Also, avoid the tub (opt for showers instead) and keep cool (avoid tight underclothing, laptop computers on the lap or other sources of heat that might increase scrotal temperature).  If you use a lubricant in sex, use a vegetable-oil base only.  Avoid environmental toxins, especially if you work regularly in an environment where this might be a concern.    The next thing is to be sure you have sex regularly, especially during fertile times.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, \"Symptoms\" of pregnancy can also be caused by hormonal changes, stress and other conditions.  The contraceptive method of implanon is quite reliable and a pregnancy would be unlikely, though no birth control is 100% except abstinence.  The bleeding irregularities are commonly reported as women adjust to these hormonal methods of contraception.  Therefore, bleeding alone would not be a determinant about pregnancy.  You can only take a home pregnancy test for verification.  These are not perfect either but usually reliable about 2 weeks after conception.    But, remember that you do not usually ovulate when on hormonal birth control so it is not very likely you are pregnant.  Antibiotics come with warnings that a back up method is encouraged  in case the effectiveness is decreased wile on birth control but it has been more recently learned that this is really only the case with a rarely-used antibiotic, Rifampin.  Because it does change the effectiveness, it was assumed early on that all antibiotics might have that effect, but this has been mostly shown not to be the case.  The warning continues \"just in case\" but the chances are that it  is not affected.  Even a \"strong\" antibiotic that is not Rifampin (which is used mostly in the treatment of TB) is not a big concern.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 21 about to be 22 year old female and I've had 22 sexual partners since I started having sex at 18. I used protection with all of them until I got into a serious relationship with my ex about 3 years ago. We were together for 2 1/2 years and I started taking Berlex birth control pills. I was taking them consistantly as I was advised to for about a year then I stopped taking them. We were not trying to have a baby but we did have unprotected sex and he did ejaculate inside me everytime. We did have sex quite a lot, so I worried I couldn't conceive. I had heard through friends, no actual doctor, that it could take birth control up to a year to completely get out of your system before you could conceive. I don't know if this is acutally true but after a year had past after that, I had been in other relationships where we had unprotected sex and still have not got pregnant. I will admit that I have used the Plan B pill 2 times after unprotected sex. Also, I still had packs of my birth control pills that I HAD NOT been taking, that I would take a pill just randomly after unprotected sex, simply as a relief factor for myself thinking that it would act somewhat as the Plan B pill, knowing now that it was pointless, but I have done this on several occasions. I'm worried that possibly that may have affected my chances of conceiving. Or perhaps I just can't concieve period. Obviously my mother could conceive, and so has my older sister, but we have different fathers so maybe that has something to do with it. I have no known knowledge of any females on my fathers side not conceiving. There are just so many occasions where I should of been pregnant but was not. I was 2 weeks late last month on my period, took a test and it read negative. I started a couple days later but only had a period for 2 days. I'm jus worried I can't conceive, please help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It would be impossible to say why you have not yet become pregnant, but the use of birth control pills (even improperly) is not likely to have caused any problems in this.  There was a time when they worried that long-term use might affect fertility but this has been mostly proven to not be the case.  Of course there are other possible reasons for infertility.  If you have not been checked for STDs, I would recommend doing so.  History of infections can result in scarring and can contribute to infertility.  Unless you have been actively trying to conceive, it may just be luck of the draw here that it hasn't happened to you yet.  Even women who are trying actively can take a while for the stars to align and conception to occur.  I would not worry too much but if you haven't seen a doctor for a pap smear and gynecological exam I would recommend that now.  A preconception visit with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   I have some question that everyone just happens to have a different answer. Can sperm go through clothes? Some say yes others say no. As for me, I was taught that the man actually needs to get his penis inside a woman's vagina (have direct contact) in order to sperm to go in and find an egg. I need an official answer from someone that actually went to medical school.  Twice this month my friend and I got a little too close to each other. I was wearing pajamas ( long pants and underwear) he was wearing his briefs. Things got a little out of hand, but we still kept our clothes on. He did rub himself against me ( but high on my  front thighs, almost near). This happened twice this moth (two weeks in between). The first time he was wet ( i was too -- but I did change my underwear after), the second time he wasn't (the second time I was wearing a pantyliner). Im currently not on birth control. I did take Nextchoice the first time (the day after it happened), Plan B the second time (almost near 72 hrs of when it happened). I know some may say this was unnecessary, but better safe than sorry  I took Plan B two days before my period ( but my period is irregular like most women), is there still a chance that I can get my period, or will the high amount of levonorgestrel (more like double the amount  due to Next Choice) stop it from coming at the prospective time?  But I just need to know, is there a possibility that I can still be pregnant even if we didnt have direct contact and I took the precautions listed above?   I have to say I'm concerned...\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The chances of you being pregnant are practically non-existent.  I know of no documented case where pregnancy occurred when there were clothes in the way.  Penetration and insertion of sperm inside the vagina is necessary.    Having taken plan B you pretty well assure that even this miraculous conception could not happen.  But, it can affect your period so don't let that worry you.  It can even take a few months for things to get back to normal following this high dose of hormone.  I would recommend finding another method of birth control to save you this grief.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Plan B contraception can affect your period so the fact that you are late does not necessarily mean anything is wrong, including pregnancy.  Also, since the encounter was late in the cycle (unlikely fertile time) and he did not ejaculate inside, the chances are very slim for pregnancy.  You should be able to wait it out and if you are worried still, in about a week, take a home pregnancy test (if your period does not start) for your own peace of mind.    Stress and worry about pregnancy often delays a woman's period as well, so there are several possible causes for the delay.  I would be very doubtful it is anything to worry about.

    "content": "Hello, Emergency contraception can interfere with the normal cycle and it could take a while for things to get back to \"normal\" as you say, but keep in mind it is also considered normal to miss or have a late period at times.  Hormones fluctuate.  You do not say if you had sex again after the October period.  If not, this further supports the idea that she is not pregnant.  The period occurs when pregnancy has not happened so I am assuming that is the case with her period.   What is happening this month could be just a normal variation.  If she happened to get pregnant against all odds on the day in question, the period would likely not have happened or would have been much lighter than usual.    A pregnancy test should put your mind at ease or confirm your fears.  Since she is late this month the test should tell by now.    Good luck.\n\n",

If this happens, your girlfriend can take a home pregnancy test.  Other symptoms include breast tenderness, sometimes frequent urination and nausea.  I would recommend that you get some condoms to be prepared and avoid such a scare in the future.  It will also reduce your risk of sexually transmitted infections.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "To Totally Confused, Yes, you could be pregnant in spite of birth control since the only 100% reliable method is abstinence.  You should repeat the pregnancy test one week later if you still have not had a more normal period.  You are correct that the hcg levels can be undetectable at first.  Of course it could be a false alarm, aggravated by stress.  I'm afraid you'll have to wait and see or go to a clinic for a serum (blood) pregnancy test which can detect pregnancy a bit earlier.  I do hope you are taking a multivitamin since you are sexually active and it is important in case of pregnancy to have adequate folic acid on board at the outset.    Best wishes.\n\n",

A home test is usually reliable a day or so after your period is expected but missed.  This is really the only way to know.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am 25 and not on any form of birth control.  My last period was somewhere between March 11 and 17.  On March 24 I had intercourse with my boyfriend, he used a condom.  On March 26 we did not have sex but he ejaculated on my stomach and fingered me pretty deeply.  Fairly sure he did not have cum on his hand then.  March 27 we had sex again, again with a condom.  Both times were fairly rough with deep penetration.  On March 29 I started cramping, and had frequent urination and some slight nausea throughout the day--mostly gagging.  Cramps and frequent urination continued until April 2.  As of April 3 only symptom is mild cramping with some concentration in lower left pelvis.   I have not had any intercourse in a couple years, and I was recently diagnosed with severe acid reflux (February 2009).  The past 2 weeks I have not been taking my full medication daily or eating well, so maybe nausea caused by that? I'm also wondering if cramping may be due to irritation that I was not used to?  Is it too early to have symptoms of pregnancy and would they go away so soon? Is it just pms? And how soon could I take a test?  Thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Proper use of a condom is a very reliable form of contraception so my first thought would not be pregnancy.  Also, cramping is not a sign of early pregnancy and nausea also doesn't usually occur until 5-7 weeks.  If you don't get your period within a week of when you expect it, you certainly could take a pregnancy test.  These are usually reliable within a few days of the period's due date.  Sometimes a false negative occurs so if you still don't get a period you can repeat the test a week later.    I suspect your symptoms could be due to any number of things such as urinary tract infection, other virus, emotional factors relating to renewed sexual activity and relationship changes.  If it doesn't subside, you may want to have your urine checked since UTIs are very common in women, especially when sexually active and your frequency and cramping is typical with this disorder.  You should definitely take your medication for acid reflux as directed because that can confuse the issue as well and damage can be done with the acid in the esophagus.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Two questions needing answers here  To:  chocokit  Your risk of pregnancy is extremely slim.  While originally we worried that many antibiotics would affect the pill, we now know that it is only a very few, rarely used antibiotics (Rifampin in particular) that cause this problem.  You also are fine to vary the time of day a little, though staying as close as possible is good since it helps you remember, but even a forgotten pill usually does not result in pregnancy, especially if you take it later when you remember.  As for whether or not it is possible, yes, there is always a possibility of pregnancy while on the pill if you have sexual intercourse, because no method except abstinence and confirmed sterility is 100% effective in preventing it.  But your risk is extremely low since you did not actually have penile penetration in the vagina which is necessary for pregnancy to occur.  If you were pregnant, I would suspect there was more activity than what you have described here. Sex without actual intercourse does not result in pregnancy under any circumstances except artificial insemination because semen/sperm must reach the cervix and that is a bit of a distance from your anus.  The additional protection of underwear adds reassurance.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "To:  caps  Hello, Your chances of pregnancy are highly unlikely with the plan B pill, but nothing is 100% reliable so there is always a slight possibility.  If you don't get your period a few days after you expect it, take a test to confirm it.  Your nausea could be the result of the pill you took or something totally unrelated, but it is very unlikely it is pregnancy caused at this early date (assuming pregnancy miraculously occurred).    Please plan another method of birth control so you won't have to stress over this next time.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is impossible to say if you are pregnant or not since many women do experience light bleeding in early pregnancy, and many women experience breakthrough bleeding and irregular periods at times in their lives.  The only thing you can really do is repeat the pregnancy test weekly, in case you are getting a false negative due to low hcg levels or see a doctor for a serum (blood) test which is more sensitive.  Be sure you are following the instructions exactly.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This would not be a typical symptom of early pregnancy and the chances, based on what you report, are extremely slim anyway.    I would be suspicious of a urinary tract infection, common in women, and often in conjunction with a change in sexual activity.  You should at least have this checked since the cramping could be from the bladder.    Some women also experience pain at the time they ovulate.  Using condoms for sex even if you were fertile at that time definitely is good protection so I would wait it out a little while.  If your period doesn't start when you expect it, take a pregnancy test.  Breast sensations can come and go with hormonal fluctuation and I would not be alarmed at this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Emotional factors sometimes delay a period and just plain hormonal fluctuation.    Since you use protection your chances are very good for not being pregnant.  However, as you know, there are always a few exceptions.  And, a pregnancy test is normally accurate about the time of the missed period, but sometimes the hcg levels are not yet high enough to be detected so repeating the test in a week is a good idea if your period hasn't started by then.  The other option is a blood (serum) test that is more sensitive.  Best wishes.\n\n",

This action was a tipsy mistake of an ex fiane of over a year ago.  I recently broke up with my last relationship.  I saw him that following Tuesday to talk.  We ended up having unprotected sex.  That following Thursday we saw eachother again also having unprotected sex, but that time we attempted to do it twice in a row while he was leaking.  He put it inside but didn't do it all the way cause it was hurting.  Both time with these guys they pulled out-I am not on the pill.  I am not due for my period until the 14th of this month or so.   My question is would you think I was pregnant and if so, who do you think most likely would be the father?  The one I had unprotected sex with before my period or the one during?  I know it sounds like a Jerry Springer situation but I was in a serious relationship with both of these guys but am still heartbrocken from the last one.  The first one, we were drunk and it was a mistake.  I'm no longer with any. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible to become pregnant this way since more semen is likely still present.  You did not mention how long ago this happened or what your cycles have been doing since then.    Abdominal girth increase is not an early sign of pregnancy.  In many young mothers pregnant with their first child, they don't \"show\" until 4-5 months.  Everyone is different but the first signs are usually missed period, sometimes tender breasts and perhaps nausea.  But stress can do these things to you also.  If the test is negative and you still have not gotten your period, repeat a test after a week just to be sure.    It is also possible to tune into some \"normal\" abdominal feelings when you are aware that there could be a pregnancy.  Kicking from a baby is not usually felt until the second half of the pregnancy.  But bowels can have flutters that imitate this sensation.  Do use a condom EVERY time  you have sex for protection.

This was my first time ever taking any form of birth control. In september my period started on the 13th and it had ended the 19th, so the sex was the day after my period ended. I've been really stressed about this to the point I'm barely sleeping, constantly worrying and the day after before I took the pill, I physically got sick due to stress. My boyfriend bought me the ept pregnancy test where you could test 5 days before your missed period, it came with two in the box. I took the first test the 21st of october and it said not pregnant, the next day I had started what I thought was my period, I wasn't in as much pain as I normally am and the only other difference was I didn't bleed as much, but the second day it was alot lighter and I bled for three, maybe four days like this. so earlier tonight I took the second test and it said the same thing, I have no pregnancy symptomns; I'm not constipated, my breasts aren't tender at all, I don't have weird cravings and no morning sickness. I've been getting headaches everyday but I think that's from being so stressed cause this is all I've been thinking about, it's really worrying me. what are the chances I am if two tests said no and I'm not having symptomns after a month? could my period have been weird from the pill I took?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Plan B does affect your periods because of the high level of hormones in it.  The two negative tests, the timing of unprotected sex, and the plan B pretty much reduce your chances of pregnancy to almost zero.  I suspect your symptoms are a combination of hormonal disruption from the pill, stress, and could even be from some completely unrelated cause that coincides with this scare.  You might consider birth control pills or some other option to reduce such future stress.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for your reply Debbie, I'm sorry for not replying to what you said sooner I've been working alot so I haven't had the time to get on the computer. I had sex september 20th, and took plan b one step the 21st. I took the ept test the 21st of october and it said not pregnant, I took another test a week later and it also said not pregnant. However, in the last post I forgot to mention that the sex happened on the last day of my period. I hadn't bled all day but I started bleeding slightly during sex which is normal for me because if I sit around alot on the last day, I wont bleed so I'll assume I'm off until I start doing something that requires alot of movement and I start bleeding again. It's been two months and one day since the unprotected sex, I still have no symptomns at all. no brest tenderness, no morning sickness, no weird cravings, nothing. I had what I thought was a period last month around the 21st, as I explained in my last post but it was short and light which you said could be the plan b and stress coinciding. so my questions now are does the fact that I bled during sex make the chance of me being pregnant higher? and you also said that the plan b can cause your periods to be irregular, but I should still have some kind of one, correct? even if it's short. I should start in a few days and I'm really hoping that happens but if not, is this a bad sign? And lastly, knowing that I bled during sex, do you still believe the chances are pretty much zero?  Please reply as soon as possible. thanks so much.\n\n",

    "content": "My wife has leukorrhea. we have been trying for a baby since 2 yrs. She has regular periods with normally 2-3 days delays. So her dates keep changing slightly. After consulting with Gynecologist, it was said that it could be the leukorrhea liquid that is stoping the sperm to get there. Note that she has problem of leukorrhea since very long time. They prescribed  'Gyno-Coryl - econazole nitrate 150mg' to be inserted deeply as high into vigina as possible for consecutive 3 nights soon after the periods and then to have sex for consecutive 5 days. We have tried the above practice only once yet. But no success so far! My semen analysis was also taken with results summary as following  Vol=2ml, Ph=Alkaline, Color=Gray-White, Viscosity=Normal, Liquefication=Within 20min, Motility after 1/2hr=47%, Motility after 1hr=39%, Motility after 2hr=31%, Count of Sperm 68 mil/ml, Morphology Normal Form= 58%. Based on that I was also prescribed to take ''Melbrosia Executive'' containing bee collected pollen, bee bread, royal jelly & gelatine capsule My questions are following. 1. What are your comments on above? 2. Is leukorrea really a big problem? 3. How can we cure leukorrhea, so that there is nothing to prevent semen to reach eggs? Any permanent cure? 4. Any sexual positions & preventions to follow to help her concieveing? 5. Any futher test would you suggest?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: leukorrhea affecting conceiving",
    "content": "Hello, I am a little bit confused myself since leukorrhea is a common, normal condition and some women are able to track their ovulation days by following the nature of this fluid.  Near the time of ovulation it usually becomes like egg white, kind of stretchy and more noticeable.  This change actually improves the motility of the sperm toward the cervix.  If there is infection, odor, burning, itching, etc. of course then it could be infection and would require treatment.  But, in the absence of these it is quite normal and women vary in the amounts they produce. There are ovulation predictor kits and calculators to help you determine your wife's likely time of fertility.  The econazole nitrate is to cure yeast overgrowth so perhaps the doctor felt this was the cause of the increased vaginal discharge.  If the discharge remains very thick and when fingers which have been inserted are pulled apart, it does not break easily, the gynecologist may suspect that the nature of the fluid is preventing the motility of sperm.  But only your doctor can tell you exactly about those suspicions.  I can only speculate.   But, you should know that sometimes infertility is simply a matter of patience.  Many couples are surprised after a few years of \"trying\" to see they spontaneously conceive while doing nothing differently.  Without a fertility workup it is difficult to know if you are truly infertile or if the stars just haven't yet aligned properly for you.    I am no expert in sperm analysis but it appears your labs are within the normal range.  This is encouraging and may just require a bit more patience.    I am not familiar with the supplementation you have been prescribed.  Herbal supplements are not tracked by the FDA and so I have little information about them.    The man-on-top position works well when trying to conceive. Place a small pillow under your hips following intercourse so that your cervix basically rests in the pool of semen for a short time (perhaps 20 minutes or so). This will allow the sperm time to easily swim up through the cervix without spilling out from gravity.  But even when everything is \"right\" sometimes the egg and sperm just don't meet up, it doesn't implant or something else goes wrong.  Don't give up and be sure to avoid any bad habits - tobacco, alcohol, drugs, excessive weight, poor diet, etc.  This applies to both of you for healthy pregnancies.  If you feel you need more help, I would suggest a fertility clinic.  There are several assisted reproduction technology options including IUI (Intrauterine insemination), ovulation stimulators (such as clomid), and in vitro fertilization to name only a few.    Good luck in your efforts to conceive, Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a healthy 21 year old woman who had unplanned unprotected sex with my boyfriend on the day after the last day of my period (Day 6, no bleeding), but as I was a virgin at the time for religious reasons, I felt uncomfortable and he withdrew and almost immediately ejaculated outside. Is it possible to become pregnant from precum alone at this time (specifically, day 6 of my period)? Are you fertile during and immediately after your period or can sperm live long enough to impregnant the egg during ovulation?   I have a normal 28 day cycle, and my period usually lasts 5 to 6 days. Around two weeks into the cycle, I experience some cramping which I always assumed to be ovulation. Am I at risk for pregnancy and should I consider emergency contraception? Which is the best?   Are there any pregnancy tests that are more effective than urine tests? I can't take a blood test or get a prescription because I don't have my own health insurance and my parents would be furious if they knew. Can I get Plan B without a prescription?   I normally wouldn't consider this option, but my boyfriend and I had never had sex before, didn't mean to and are in no position to have a baby. I also know how irresponsible it is to ignore health risks by having unprotected sex, but I'm very confused and upset and ashamed with myself and could really use some advice and answers.   Rest assured, I won't be making the same mistake again.   Thanks very much.   Katie   PS: Due to my religious beliefs I can't and don't want to have an abortion, so I need to deal with this issue now.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Katie,  It would be very unlikely that you would be pregnant from sex on that 6th day or your cycle, considering your usual, regular menstrual pattern.  If you were using a rhythm method of birth control, this would be considered one of the \"safe\" days even with ejaculation inside your vagina.  But, that said, there is always a remote chance because ovulation is not completely predictable.  Sperm can live up to five days in the woman's body so five days prior to ovulation would be the beginning of what we might call the fertile period.  We usually consider days 8 through 19 to be the time to avoid intercourse or use alternate methods beyond strictly natural family planning or \"rhythm\".  This is why day 6 would be definitely outside the range where it might be expected.  Add to that the fact you are only dealing with pre-cum and I'd say you're probably safe.  As for Plan B - not all pharmacies carry it but it should be available without a prescription for women over age 18.  If you choose to take this, keep in mind there are side effects from the high dose of hormones and it can affect your regular cycles for a few months.  It is also fairly expensive.  But, it would offer the most sure solution if you do not feel comfortable that you are \"safe.\"  Good luck.  Don't be too hard on yourself.  You sound like a very responsible young woman who did get swept up in the emotions and passions.  These are normal feelings and we all make mistakes - things we regret later.  I'm sure your religious beliefs also account for repenting from mistakes and starting over.      Best wishes for you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It can take your body a few months to get to a normal bleeding routine but it's nothing to worry about.  It is possible to become pregnant right away, however, so if you suspect pregnancy, take a home urine test weekly as long as you are concerned.  It is not necessary to have a period to become pregnant, though having one first helps you date the pregnancy.  But, with ultrasound, it is possible to determine weeks' gestation even without that information.    Nothing here to worry about.  Best wishes and good luck in your efforts to conceive.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This does not sound like a long time to be untreated and I would not expect long-term complications but there is no way to say for sure without extensive testing as might be done if you find yourself dealing with infertility.  The main concern is could there be scarring of the fallopian tubes as a result of the infection, left untreated.  But since it was only a couple of months chances are good it did not develop into a full-blown infection to cause such damage.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm almost 21 years old and I have been with 29 partners (all male). Many of these partners have been unprotected or were relationships where we didn't use protection any longer. I can't take birth control due to family history of it's usage (all the women in my family have taken it, all have had blood clots due to taking it) and I'm not willing to risk it. I have been tested and know I am clean from disease; but what bugs me is that I haven't had children. My previous three relationships including my ex husband, have all ended due to our failed attempts at conceiving a child. My ex husband has a child and several men I've been with have children. I'm a perfectly healthy woman with regular periods, yet for some reason I can't have children. I'm afraid to go to a doctor, because I'm afraid at being so young they will think I'm crazy for saying \"I don't think I can have kids!\" I know it deep in my soul that I can't have children, because as often as I have sex and as many people as I've been with; it should have occurred by now. I don't have PCOS or any other underlying illnesses that might cause this. The only thing I can associate it to is that although I started my meses at 13 years old, I didn't get body hair or pubic hair until I was 15. I still do not have underarm hair and very little in the pubic area. My breasts are what I call underdeveloped although very large; they still look like a 13 year olds breasts (shape, color, firmness) and I do not have cleavage. I never developed curves like most women, even though all the women in my family are hourglass figures; I'm straight. I still have horrible acne, almost as though I were 12 years old (not quite as bad as it was when I was 12 but still bad) and my lack in secondary sex traits is the only thing I can attribute to my infertility.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You should know that many women who are married and having regular sexual intercourse do not get pregnant right away.  Sometimes it takes several years to achieve a desired pregnancy, though typically with regular sex it happens within about a year or so.  I would not worry too much yet.  Of course you could be right about your \"gut\" feeling about not being fertile but you are right about probably having trouble convincing a doctor to worry just yet.  The doctor could test your hormones to see if you have a high level of testosterone or something of that nature but your particular shape is not necessarily indicative of problems that would relate to fertility.  Plenty of women with similar characteristics bear children just fine.  Best wishes.\n\n",

After alot more pressure the left one became open, but you could only see a faint line of the dye, and barely see it coming out on top of the ovary. Our ovulation window is open at this time. Now that one tube is open, should she lay on her right side after intercourse?  Do you have advise?  thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Positioning after intercourse has not been proven in any major studies but some suggest the best position is with the woman on the bottom and afterward propping a pillow under her hips to allow gravity to help move the sperm to the cervix faster.  But, it is doubtful that lying on the side would make any difference.  It probably won't hurt though so if you want to try it, go ahead.    The odds for achieving pregnancy in women younger than 40 after reversal is between 60 and 77% with younger women at the higher end.  Over age 40 chances decrease significantly.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Fallopian tubes help eggs to move from the ovary to the uterus each cycle (month). Tubal ligation is a procedure done for women who chose not to become pregnant (permanently). There are different surgical procedures that are used to achieve this purpose like cauterization and tying (clips). Failure rates are reported in some cases and pregnancy could occur  in 1 out of 200 women. Causes of tubal ligation failure may include: incomplete closure of the tubes, slipping out of the tying clips. Reversal procedures of tubal ligation are also available and only specialists can advise which is more convenient if any is possible. However, attention should be paid to exclude ectopic (tubal) pregnancy if pregnancy occurs after a tubal ligation due to an increased risk from the damaged tubes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is a common occurrence with a new relationship.  Tubals can sometimes be reversed, though there is no guarantee of fertility afterwards due to scarring.  But ablations are not intended for anyone wishing to have another child and the lining of the uterus is no longer functioning as would be necessary to sustain a pregnancy.  It would be very risky and your chances are so slim I would not spend the money for the reversal and I doubt a doctor would advise you to try under the circumstances.  It is certainly understandable that you want to give your husband a child.  Perhaps the two of you could adopt a child together or just try to find contentment in sharing your children.  An involved stepfather can do great things for children and can be just as rewarding s having a child of his own.    Aside from this, surrogate parenthood would be the only other idea I could suggest.    My best to both of you.\n\n",

I am 20 years old and I normally get very regular periods ever so often maybe once a year I'll miss a month, but I got married last year and my husband and I had plan to have a baby. Initially we thought we were pregnant because I missed 1 months of my menstrual cycle and I took an HPT took 2 one in the morning and one in the evening. Both showed pregnant. We were going to go to a doctor, but seeing as I was on a very tight schedule so was he. We had made the appointment a month after we took the test. Before we went to see a doctor. The 3rd month I had gotten my period. We were a bit disappointed. We tried again and my last period was around December 19th 2007. In February I thought for sure I was getting my period because (sorry for the detailed description.) I went to the restroom  and when I was wiping there was a streak of blood.  I got a panti liner and put it on but surprisingly I didn't have my period. So afterwards I thought I might be a few days late. Through the whole month of February I didn't have my period at all. Now it's March 07, Yesterday I started bleeding and again I thought it might be my period and there were little clots of blood like I would normally see on a period but the thing is there isn't even enough blood to reach my panti. I can only see blood when I wipe myself. Throughout the month I've been feeling sudden nausea, migraines, abdominal and back pain. fatigue, huge appetite, I've also gain some weight, my breasts feel tender and sore every now and then. They have also grown. They grew 1 whole cup size in the last 2 months. I took another HPT today and it said Not pregnant. Is there still a possibility that I am pregnant even if the HPT says I am not?  and thank you for the patience in reading my post in advance. I really appreciate it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible you could be pregnant since some women's HcG levels are slow to rise, even in a viable pregnancy.  You could get a serum (blood) test through your doctor. These are more sensitive.  Since you do exhibit symptoms that are consistent with pregnancy, it seems likely, though I have seen it go either way.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "My wife has had an IUD inserted in her for a couple years now.  But lately I have noticed that we've been having random scares where her period is abnormal that what it use to be.  I'm scared that the IUD might be not as effective.  I don't know what the problem could be.  I know that our sex has increased greatly in the recent 8 months but could that be the case?  Is it possible to increase our chances of her getting pregnant with an increase rate of sex?  A few months ago she showing signs of prenancy, breast swollen and painful, period was like a week late than scheduled and so on.  I told her to get a pregnancy test and it came up negative.  And this past weekend she was having the same symptoms with an increased appetite.  We have a 4yr old son so we've been through a prenancy before but that was without an IUD.  I'm worried about any damaged about being pregnant with the IUD still inserted and I would like to know we the high rate of sex we're starting to have, especially during her ovulation phase, will we have a higher possibilty of becoming prenant?  Any and all answers will GREATLY appreciated.  If you could, could you email me your responses as well at kidszer0@aol.com thanks a lot.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: INCREASE IUD FAILURE RATE",
    "content": "Hello, You did not mention how long your wife has had this IUD in or what kind it was but these are usually designed to be good for five years without decrease in effectiveness during that time.  There is a slight failure rate, as with any contraceptive method except abstinence and confirmed sterility.  In five years time about 7 women in 1,000 will become pregnant.  Frequency of sex does not change he IUD's effectiveness, considering that it works in several ways, preventing fertilization of the egg by damaging or killing sperm. The IUD also affects the uterine lining, making it a more hostile environment for sustaining a pregnancy.  In most women who do become  pregnant, the IUD is safely removed.    After a few months of use, most women notice a decrease in menstrual bleeding and sometimes complete cessation after a while, so this alteration in periods is not necessarily indicative of pregnancy.  With the negative tests, you can be quite confident it is still working.  Changes in cycles happen throughout a woman's life, with or without IUDs and are usually normal.    Your wife should have been instructed in how to verify that the IUD is still there.  If in doubt about that, she should have it checked by a health care provider.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I had an iud for over two years, during that time I had very irregular periods, some light, one heavy enough that I was in the hospital twice hooked up to an i.v. due to the loss of blood. After two and a half years I started getting really sick out of nowhere, I had been having bleeding on and off for the past month and a half, not like my usual period, mostly spotting. I figured there was no way I was pregnant but decided one day to take a test since my friend had one and I was completely shocked to find out I was pregnant. I went to the doctors the next day and found out I was a little over 8 weeks pregnant. The strings had been pulled up into my cervix and the iud was not removable anymore. I went to see a specialist and was told because of the amout of bleeding I had been experiencing there was a 10% chance my baby could be born healthy. I was told that if I chose to continue the pregnancy there was a very good chance the iud would get implanted into me and cause my water to break very early with a high chance of birth defects and there was a good possibility I would not be able to have any children again. After alot of thinking we chose to abort the pregnancy because of the 90% chance of miscarriage or an unhealthy baby. After all of this I found out that my best friends mother had been through the same thing. About a year later my best friend also became pregnant with an iud in place. It defenitely can happen, the most important thing I can say is that if you think there is a chance of pregnancy get a test ASAP! If I had caught it earlier there would have been a good chance of removing the iud and having a normal pregnancy, I just figured I was being paranoid but I was right.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Since you have seen a doctor it sounds like they feel you are still within a safe limit of bleeding so I assume it is not especially heavy.  Things will probably slow down unassisted but if not, you should call the doctor again for advice on how to proceed since your follow up was to be after the bleeding stopped.    Even if you have some condition of the cervix waiting a few more days will not make the difference in treatment.  Bleeding can be a signal that something is not right, but this type of bleeding is rarely an emergency unless you are soaking more than a pad every hour for several hours straight.  Try to be patient but let the doctor know what is happening.  It's the only way they will know.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pregnancy after an abortion",
    "content": "Hello, Most women conceive naturally following an abortion but it is considered normal for it to take up to a year even with regular sexual intercourse.  Obviously some women conceive as soon as they start trying but most often it takes a few months.  After a year, it is good to see your doctor to be sure there is nothing preventing pregnancy.  Of course this could be your husband as well as yourself with a problem, if indeed you are unable to conceive within the year's time.  Sometimes it is just luck of the draw since so many things must be in coordination with each other for conception to occur.  Sperm has a limited life; eggs have a very short time of being present for fertilization, implantation must occur and there must be good development of the embryo, placenta, etc.  Miscarriages often happen when things don't go right - it's nature's way.     My point is that what you have experienced so far is not abnormal.  People just seem to be impatient sometimes and we think we have more control over these plans than we really do.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It is normal for it to take up to a year to achieve a pregnancy when you are trying so patience is your best plan.    Most experts recommend having sex every other day while trying to conceive and especially around days 8 through 19 of your cycle (start counting on the first day of your menstrual cycle).

I've had my implant in for 2 1/2 years its due out in feb next year and so far no pregnacies. However recently I found myself getting very depressed around the date of my period to the point where it was starting to have impact on my relationship. I didn't want to tell the doctor because I don't want my medical records to say that I suffered from depression so I started taking st john's wort. I assumed that because it's a herbal remedy and available over the counter that it wouldn't have any side effects. I had been taking it for about a month when my mum came to visit me, (she's a nurse) she saw the st john's wort in the bathroom and told me that I shouldn't be taking it because it can cause implanon to stop working properly. I have looked around on web for more info and found out that she was right but I can't find any info on how long you have to have been taking it for it to effect implanon, and advice would be good. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The reason you cannot find this information is because it really is not known.  Extensive testing has not been performed in this.  Herbal supplements definitely have side effects.  Just because it is available without prescription does not mean it is not potent medication.  It just is not regulated by the FDA and other agencies because it is a supplement; not a drug per se.  Be careful whenever you take any kind of medication.  If you have symptoms of depression, discuss this with your doctor.  There are also some other remedies such as increased exercise and daily sunlight that raises your serotonin levels safely. I would recommend a book, When Your Body Gets the Blues, by Marie-Annette Brown and Jo Robinson.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Plan B is effective up to five days after unprotected intercourse.  It is most effective the earlier it is taken.  Sperm can travel even if it is in the lower part of the vagina, though it would be more difficult for sure.  And every unprotected encounter does not result in pregnancy.  It would only be if she were ovulating about that time.  So, it is probable she will not become pregnant anyway, if it is past the time frame for emergency contraception.  All things considered, this is not a likely scenario for pregnancy.    Good luck,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I wonder if you have some unrelated cause for the frequent urination.  Perhaps a urinary tract infection is causing this.    The only way to know if you might possibly be pregnant is if you take a test.  The contraceptive injection will not affect the accuracy of the test so when in doubt, do a home test.   These are usually accurate within a couple of weeks of conception.  Most likely things will resolve, unless you do have an infection but if not, you will need to see your doctor.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, i'm 18 years of age and have recently started sex with my long term partner, at first we used condoms, but the last time it had split so i decided to go on the pill. However, i couldn't start taking my first pack until my next period which was two weeks later.  Within these two weeks i have been experiencing pregnancy symptoms, such as constant urination, chronic cramps in my stomach much like period pains, and tiredness. This made me very uneasy as i waited for my period which was a few days late, so i took a home pregnancy test. It was negative, and within a couple of days later my period had started, but thats what i thought it was. I started my first pack on the second day of my period, as i had forgotten to take it on the first day.  Now it is the third day of my period, the blood has become extremely light and nearly almost not coming through, when usually i have quite heavy periods which last up to 5-6 days. And another strange thing is that the day prior to my 1st day of bleeding, i had a lot of brown blood coming through.  Now my questions are, was that not my period and could it have been spotting, another sign of pregnancy?  Since i have already taken one pill should i carry on the rest of the packet? If so would this affect the pregnancy?  Many thanks for those who take interest in my situation and reply.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The side effects of bleeding irregularity are normal with use of hormonal birth control methods such as the pill.  Usually there is an adjustment period of a few months before a regular pattern is established.  Very often periods are lighter while on the pill.  If you were to find yourself pregnant (about 1% of users do within a year) you would stop the pill but it has not been shown to do harm or cause birth defects if you have taken them in early pregnancy prior to the diagnosis.  I would advise continuing as scheduled unless you get a positive pregnancy test.  I would assume this was a period for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, When it comes to effects on sperm production and quality, very little is known.  We do know there are approximately 3-5% of all babies born with birth defects.  Many of these are of unknown causes and could be related to the father. There may be a combination of factors that contribute to problems - genetic, environmental, etc.    When it comes to hormones there is always the potential for an adverse effect.  The truth is, there is much we don't know.  It seems like it would be worth it to be cautious and avoid any risky exposures while you are working at a pregnancy.  The supplement industry is not regulated by the FDA so we know even less about all the side effects of those.  Good luck in your efforts.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Yes, it is possible you will conceive.  Many women with retroverted uteri and even PCOS do.   Sometimes they get help with an ovulation stimulator.  Endometriosis, if it gets bad, sometimes has to be cleared out a bit through laparoscopic surgery but if you do become pregnant first, the endometriosis usually improves during the pregnancy so don't be too alarmed at that.  Keep in mind that getting the good diagnoses is important so you can correctly treat anything that may be interfering so think of the new information as helpful toward your goal; rather than a hindrance, because much can be done once the doctor knows what you are dealing with.  Try to keep from stressing too much as this can interfere with ovulation patterns.  Be hopeful, optimistic and maintain a healthy, regular pattern of sexual intercourse.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Tubbykins,  I know these situations can be very frustrating. I am an RN that is also suffering with PCOS and Endometriosis. Metformin or Glucophage is the most used medication to treat PCOS, and most Physicians will encourage you to take 1500mg of the medication a day, but with the side effects that it can cause can be hard. I do agree with Debbie, RN that stress is not going to help your situation.  Speak with you Physician about possibly using a medication to help stimulation ovulation, such as Clomid. This is usually the first line of defense with PCOS and the ovulation problems that it can cause. Are you overweight? If so even losing 10 pounds can make a big difference in you irregular cycles. Also, PCOS being an endocrine disorder, can put you at a higher risk becoming Diabetic, and as you have posted in your history, you have a family history of this disorder. If you are already diabetic the most important thing that you can do to get pregnant is to properly treat your diabetes.   Endometriosis can be treated in many ways and it depends on the severity that your physician will choose your course of treatment. There is a medication called Lupron Depot which is a very well know medication in the treatment of Endometriosis. Speak with your Doctor about it and see if it can be something that could help you and your condition.   The best thing you can do is have a very open line of communication with your physician and let him/her know how serious you are about getting your body ready to carry a pregnancy. I know this is a hard situation, but don't sit around and take the \"Why Me?\" stance, get up and be pro-active in your care. You will be glad that you did!  Good luck,  Adrianne G, RN\n\n",

    "content": "I have always had a regular cycle.  I had a molar pregnancy in 2004.  I had the labs ran, as directed.  In Aug 2005 I found out I was pregnant again.  I did not have any problems getting pregnant.  While I was pregnant I had Polyhydramnios.  After my daughter was born at 33 weeks and 3 days my cycle has not been regular since.  I saw my OBGYN they ran labs, but did not follow up.  They checked my insulin, TSH, and glucose.  All were normal except my insulin level.  My level was 102 fasting.  I saw my PCP, and she ran a C Peptide, repeat TSH, Insulin, A1C, and a test to check my ovary function.  All labs came back normal except my C Peptide was 4.1 and my insulin was 100.  She then sent me to have an ultrasound.  They stated I had a 2 mm or less cyst on my left ovary.  There were no other cyst.  They are wanting me to start taking Metformin.  I was not too happy to start taking the medication because I have been checking my sugar at least twice a day and it ranges from mid 80's to 102.  I am more interested in getting a medication like Phentermine.  I am over weight and in the back of my mind that will be the fix to my problem.  On the other hand my PCP is trying to say I have PCOS.  I don't feel like the diagnosis is correct.  I do not have the symptoms except my cycle is off now and my insulin level is a little off.  Do you recommend any treatment or anything to figure out what is going on?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I have seen Metformin work well and it won't do you any harm that I can see.  I have even had patients report a loss of weight once they were taking this medication which helps regulate their insulin and blood glucose.  Phentermine has very limited usefulness, is not intended to be used long-term and in most cases the appetite suppression is temporary.  Therefore, taking Metformin now and possibly using Phentermine in addition for a few weeks might be a good solution to help you with your weight concerns.   You are correct that the added weight contributes to other problems but the Metformin is definitely a good option to try.  Be sure to talk to your doctor about your desire to lose weight because there may be other ways you can get help.  Often the provider is reluctant to bring up what is probably a sensitive and frustrating issue, even when doing so would be in the patient's best interest.  So, if you bring it up, your doctor may offer some suggestions.  You may also benefit from a consultation with a dietician.  Good luck and best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 20 year old female, and a virgin for personal choices/reasons. My boyfriend and I spent the night together last night (April 26th) and we slept naked together. We did a lot of rubbing/grinding where genitals were touching. There was never any intercourse, no penetration. And when he ejaculated it was nowhere near my vagina. I know about precum, but I'm concerned about what the chances are of me maybe being pregnant? Also, should I take a pregnancy test? If so, when? Should I go and get Plan B? I am on the birth control pill for the control of my periods.  I've heard different things from how long sperm can last to how good of swimmers they can be. With the time spent today of me being worried/paranoid of somehow being pregnant, I'll most definitely think twice before doing those things again. I do understand the risk of exchanges of diseases, STDs, etc because of what I was doing.  Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you SO much!  -HardWorkingGirl\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Congratulations on your desire to avoid sexually transmitted diseases and unplanned pregnancy.  You are making healthy choices, though sleeping naked with your boyfriend will make it more difficult to keep your resolve because you are coming so close.  Self-control in this area is very difficult for young people and you may not realize how it can happen until it is too late.  Emotions and physical desire take over and sometimes you just can't stop it once it reaches a certain point.  Abstinence definitely has many advantages but you are playing with fire if this is important to you.  Sperm must be placed inside the vagina in order to \"swim\" and penetrate far enough for conception.  It would be practically impossible without penetration by the penis or artificial insemination for this to occur so if what you have described here is what happened, you can be confident you are not pregnant.    Furthermore, the reason you are on oral contraceptives may not be for that purpose specifically but the effectiveness is the same anyway and you would be well protected.  Plan B is totally unnecessary and the powerful hormones have side effects so this should not be used without a good indication for it.     Best wishes.\n\n",

It becomes easy to be swept up in a moment of passion or lose your resolve, thinking you've come this far anyway.  Spend your time in productive activities that help you to know each other as people, doing what you both enjoy because these are the things that truly make or break relationships in the long run.  Your decision tells me this is what your are interested in; not casual (and dangerous) sex.  As far as pregnancy and disease go, you are safer this way for sure.

    "content": "Hello, There are varying types of acne, some of which are aggravated by hormones.  Birth control pills are known to often help women with acne.  There are other treatment options such as Accutane.  Sometimes the condition gets worse and very dry skin and mucus membranes are some of the side effects.  It is also known to cause serious birth defects so it is recommended that sexually active women who use this continue on contraception throughout the treatment course of around 17 to 20 weeks.  You have time to complete this course if you will commit to the birth control.  Blood work is also done regularly to be sure your triglycerides do not become too elevated.   This is powerful medicine and in most cases it is a long-term, effective solution.  If your dermatologist has not discussed this with you, I would suggest you ask about it.  You should not attempt pregnancy until you have been off the medication for three months. This would be appropriate along with your marriage plans.    What you have tried so far is mostly in the antibiotic family.  If this is not working, it suggests to me that is not the problem.  The cystic type acne is the most responsive to isotretinoin (Accutane) so I think you might be a good candidate.  Meanwhile I would suggest using benzoyl peroxide daily (light application) after washing with a mild cleanser (no scrubbing).  Salicylic acid is also effective.  These preparations do not have to be in expensive formulations and they are easy to obtain over the counter.  They will do no harm so you've nothing to lose.  Good luck.\n\n",

I stopped taking it four days ago and started to bleed two days later, my husband and I had unprotected sex, and I don't think I am pregnant given the results of my web searching, but I am bleeding more than I did while on the pill, I did stop mid-cycle, and I know I probably just messed up my ovulating when it does come back...any advice on promoting ovulation or anything to help me get pregnant sooner would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Oral contraceptives can affect your periods as well as ovulation patterns but I would not be too concerned.  Some people ovulate very soon after going off the pill; others  take a few months.   Either is considered a normal response to the cessation of the drug.  Most likely this is the reason for your bleeding and this will probably slow down and a pattern will resume, however, pregnancy could occur before things have become regular.  This doesn't matter since pregnancy dating can be confirmed by ultrasound.   Meanwhile, be sure to take a multivitamin containing at least 400 mcg of folate or folic acid.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Should I be on Clomid? Risk of multiple gestation?",
    "content": "My husband and I have been trying to conceive for the last six months unsuccessfully. I am 24, he is 26. I have no significant medical history with the exception of a term gestation in 2007. Our daughter was the result of an unplanned pregnancy while using natural family planning. I have used OCP's and Implanon in the past for contraception. The implanon was removed six months ago and I resumed my regular cycle that month. I have regular 24-26 day cycles and I am pretty sure I am ovulating every time around day 10 or 11. Ovulation is verified by abdominal discomfort and positive LH surge. I went to my regular OB to rule out infertility last month. On day 3 we did an ultrasound to observe my ovaries which appeared normal and had good reserve. All my bloodwork came back normal. My OB prescribed clomid 50mg days 3-7. On day 14 we did another ultrasound due to abdominal discomfort. There were 7 follicles over 20mm, 4 on the left and 3 on the right and my uterine lining looked \"very good\". I was advised to continue with daily intercourse and to make sure my husband was gentle with me due to my extreme discomfort. The next day I ovulated and the discomfort on both sides resolved. My OB is planning on continuing with another round of clomid 50mg if I am not pregnant this month and did not seem interested in referring my husband for screening. He basically told me it is the woman's problem most of the time. I am curious if I even need clomid or is my doc trying to give me a magic bullet? What are the chances of concieving this month? Am I at high risk for multiple gestation? Does working the night shift affect fertility? Should I insist on having my husband tested or should we just relax and let nature take it's course. I went to my OBGYN expecting for him to say don't worry just give it some time and now I feel like a science lab. Isn't trying to have a baby supposed to be fun? Please give me your opinions.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Should I be on Clomid? Risk of multiple gestation?",
    "content": "Hello, At your age, the recommendation is to try on your own for a year.  In that time 885% of fertile couples will conceive unassisted.  Clomid is frequently used and your doctor knows your situation better than I do but it seems he perhaps jumped the gun a little.  It is possible he sensed impatience for pregnancy on your part so wanted to help in this way.    Yes, you are at risk for multiples, which is the primary reason we recommend unassisted conception if it is possible and unless you are not ovulating on your own.  As you surely know, multiples do carry considerable risk in morbidity and mortality.  If you have PCOS or some other condition, clomid can help and most of the time a singleton pregnancy is the outcome, but you definitely have a higher risk of twins or more on this drug.    I know many women who take one round of clomid, then stop.  Often within a few months they are pregnant - without the assistance of ovulation stimulation.    Discuss this with your doctor but you would certainly be in the norm to just give it time to happen on its own.  You can always resort to intervention after a reasonable time.  I know we like to think we can totally control this and conceive in exactly the month we desire, and we're often short on patience.  It's good to plan for pregnancy so you can be in top physical condition when conception happens, but try not to overdo the attempts at control.  Most women , even when trying to conceive, are caught a little off guard when it actually happens - a fun surprise.  You did not mention if your husband is the father of your other child.  If so, you can be quite confident there is no need for testing him right away.  Unless he had chemotherapy or some trauma that might have interfered with his fertility, it is unlikely he has developed it since then. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "My last period was 13th march 2009 and i have a regular 28 day cycle with 5 days on period. during the week beggining 23rd march me and my partner had sex every day until 29th.   Now the date is 17th April so i am 7 days late on my period.   I have taken 2 pregnancy tests which were EPT one on the first day of missed period and one 4 days after missed period and they have both came out negative although i didnt take them first thing in the morning i took them in the afternoon and late at night.   I have been having some strange symptoms, my period pains have changed so they are not severe this month which they usually are but very mild, almost like a pinching sensation and this is not everyday. i have broken out in spots, my nails seem to have grown rapidly and have also gained strength in the last 2 weeks and i have been experiencing chronic headaches and nausea for the last week and a half but no vommiting. my breasts are not sore at all which they usually are a couple of days before i am due on but i have noticed more white bumps on my nipple and around the areola as weel as my nipples seeming more errect recently.   Im a little more worried about the headaches because they are quite bad all over the top of my head and round the back of my head above my neck.   Im wondering how effective these EPT tests are and whether is is worth using a different brand in a couple of days or booking an appointment with my doctor.   Me and my partner are TTC for the last 6 months but i have never experienced anything like this in any other month.   Any advice you can give me would be appreciated.   Thanks very much\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The EPTs are quite reliable but some women don't show high enough hcg levels at the beginning.  Some tests are more sensitive than others so theoretically, brand could matter.  First Response is one I have been told is very good, but still, for some women, this could still show a false negative.  If you want even more reliability, a blood (serum) test can pick up the lower levels sooner.  This can be done with a doctor or clinic.    Symptoms of pregnancy and other hormonal fluctuation vary with the individual so it is impossible to diagnose strictly on these.  They also tend to be the same symptoms some people have in other conditions as well.  This can confuse the issue considerably.    Follow the directions including time of day, and repeat the screening weekly unless your period starts.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The ultrasound  says i CONCIEVED on October 29, 2008 and that i was 9 weeks 5 days. Thats 4 days before my period. My doctor said that must have not been a real period and i don't think so either cause i bleed for 7 days and yes people do bleed that long but not me i never bleed that long only FIVE days its gone the 5th day totelly gone always in the 27 years i have been living. My measurements of the ultrasound done at 9 weeks 5 days are this... The uterus measures 13.1 cm in length. Crown rump length measures 2.92cm. The mean sac diameter measures 4.28cm. ok the story is i was indeed with someone the last week of October and then we broke up. Then i wasn't with anyone else till november 16th or 17th i ddi sleep with someone at that time. I then went to doctors and got a pregnancy test done  on december 2 and it had really strong pregancy results. the nurse even joked and said maybe your having twins. is it posible that the guy in november 16 or 17 got me pregnant or is the ultrasound at 9 weeks the whole truth? and i got pregnant october 29th my concieve date? by the way my due date is August 5th according to my ultrasound at 9 weeks 5 days. thanks soooo much for taking the time to help me this means sooo much i have been worried for many months who could be the father.

    "content": "Hello, Infertility is not a reported complication of depo though it is impossible to say how any individual will respond to this kind of hormonal manipulation.  But it can take a little while for your cycles to resume normally and ovulation to resume.  It is also considered normal for it to take up to a year to become pregnant when you are fertile and actively trying.  Fertility testing isn't even recommended until you have tried for a year without success, since 85% become pregnant in this time frame.  Of the other 15% many will become pregnant within the next year or so.  Patience is in order here.  Sometimes we think we should have complete control over these things, but in truth, there is a bit of luck involved in the complex process of conception and pregnancy.  You should be sure you are having sex regularly if conception is your goal, especially since you don't know exactly when you will ovulate. Good luck.\n\n",

I know that I am only 23 and that is what makes this hard for me to seem to get though to my gyno about my worries. I have already graduated from college and have been with the same person since I was 14 years old, we both have good jobs and live completly on our own (with lots of family love and support). I have only been with him and he has only been with me and we will be getting married April of 2009 after being together 9 years. With all of this being said, I am not nieve and I know what a life changing event it is to have a baby and I truly believe that we are more then ready to embrace apon this journy. My problem now is that I haven't had a period since going off of the pill except for after going to the gyno and requesting provera to get things started. I finally got my first period in 7 months about 4 weeks ago and it lasted about 10 days. I have taken ovulation tests ever since with no luck. I know my cycle probaly hasn't taken its full course yet but I just had high hopes. Hopefully my period starts again on it's own next month or I'm not sure what else to do?? I am 5'6 and 220lbs so my gyno said it might be because I am overweight so I have been working out and eating more healty ever since. My main question for you is if I don't get my period next month what should my next step be? My gyno said to go back on the pill but I want to have a baby and by her telling me that, I don't think she really understands and that is not an option for me at all! I've heard of clomid to get ovulation started but I don't know if I should go that far... I just don't understand why the pill has messed my body up to this point? Before the pill I was always regular and I've always been somewhat overweight...I just don't understand whats going on? Any help you can give me would be greatly apreciated.

    "content": "Hello, Menstrual irregularities are quite common in all women at times.  Old blood is nothing to worry about.  Of course you could have a cyst and many women have these - sometime with symptoms; sometimes without.  I would just do watchful waiting to see if things correct themselves in a few months.  Chances are it is hormonal fluctuation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I came off the pill mid January (been on it 5 years and it was Femodene) and had my period a few days later - as normal. Since then my (2) periods have been dark brown in colour. The latest one had a slight bit of red blood in it but not much at all! They have lasted 7 days, and i didnt need to wear a tampax.  My husband and i are wanting to try for a baby, but im very confused as to what is happening to my periods. Before going on the pill i was very regular and had fairly heavy and quite painful periods.     Many thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: dark brown periods",
    "content": "Hello, It can take a while to get normal periods and ovulation after going off the pill - not necessarily, but possibly. Dark color simply means old blood that has been held in the uterus, perhaps leftover from the previous period.  This is nothing to be alarmed about.  If you have regular, unprotected intercourse, chances are you will become pregnant within the year and you don't need to worry too much about when you ovulate since everyone varies a bit on this anyway.  Most often it occurs somewhere around 14 days prior to your period but this varies considerably with each woman.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "After 5 failed IUI's, we decided to try IVF.  At first we were told we had a male factor, low motility.  Then after changing RE's, we were told I in fact had a high FSH (10.6) and that IVF was our best chance of achieving pregnancy.  On that recommendation we just underwent our first 'failed' IVF cycle.  It seemed doomed from the beginning.  We started out hopeful, on retrieval day were excited to learn that I yielded 16 oocytes. A number we were told was excellent!  Unfortunately the very next day the call came... only 1 out of the 16 fertilized and they performed ICSI on all of them!  We were devistated.  And we weren't really given a clear answer as to why this happened.  It could be poor egg quality, the eggs could be rejecting/killing the sperm, etc... Well the next day brought more positive (so we thought) news, 3 more had fertilized over night and we were scheduled for a 3 day transfer.  And so we went and were surprised to learn that yet another one fertilized for a total of 5!  Wow, we thought we were lucky!  We had 2 - 8cell, 1 - 7cell, 1 - 6cell and 1 - 4cell.  We decided to transfer the strongest 4 and prayed the little 4cell would develop enough to freeze.  Longer story short-the cycle failed and the remaining egg 'arrested' so we have nothing to freeze.  Because I'm not satisfied with the answers I received from my RE, can anyone here provide some insight?  What went wrong? Is it an egg quality factor? (BTW-Embryologist said eggs 'looked great') A sperm factor?   Thanks! Desperate for Answers\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  This type of injury can sometimes, rarely, cause sterility, but more often causes a lowered sperm count. Even this usually is self-correcting over time, assuming  there is not specific damage to the apparatus. I've seen the result  of blunt force trauma to the testicles, and it can be quite alarming, but it's usually due to hematoma such as your husband suffered, it almost always is resorbed, and rarely is there a serious long-term fertility problem as a result.    There are a great many things that can affect the ability to conceive and that can affect sperm production. Some things you may want to consider (a checklist) would be: exposure to toxins (as in the workplace or via certain medications); tobacco use (which  can be a significant factor in reducing  the number of healthy sperm as well as the overall count); alcohol (more than two drinks per day); marijuana use (which can affect sperm motility); heat of any sort, locally (bicycle riding, hot tubbing, fever due to recent illness, etc.); use of anabolic steroids; and finally, even sometimes use of lubricants (although vegetable-based ones usually are ok).   So you see there are lots of potential blockades to successful conception. While  I don't think the old  injury should be totally discounted, especially if the difficulty continues, it seems fairly unlikely it's the source of the problem. If, after a year of trying, there's been no success, you both might want to be checked for possible physiological problems. But first, your husband should run down the above checklist to make sure he's eliminated all the possible roadblocks on his side of things.   I  hope this is helpful. Good luck to both of you, and please follow up with us here as necessary.\n\n",

I agree with most other posts who have responded to this question. a blunt injury to the testis, experienced by many men to different degrees, is quite common and very memorable but does not usually affect fertility, especially if no chronic symptoms occur (i.e. pain).  I agree that an evaluation at this point should include a thorough history (as outlined in one response) and a physical examination and one or 2 semen analyses for the infertility. Women should also consider a cycle day 3 FSH level (with estradiol) and a thorough history and physical with  a careful review of menstrual cycle history.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Even though you are  young, typically a woman who is sexually active without using contraception achieves pregnancy within about a year, so I don't think a doctor will brush off your concern now.  There are tests to determine if you are ovulating.  This is called secondary infertility, when you have conceived in the past but are unable to conceive again.  That does not mean you will not still become pregnant.  It often takes couples longer than this and they may be pleasantly surprised one day when it happens spontaneously.  But, if you are not ovulating, there is medication for ovulation stimulation, such as Clomid. This should only be used under the direction of a physician.  You may even wish to see a fertility specialist about this.  Secondary infertility accounts for approximately 60% of fertility problems.  Things can happen between the first pregnancy and subsequent pregnancies.  In the meantime it is wise to be sure you are in the best physical condition possible.  You should eat healthy foods, including a multiple vitamin,exercise regularly and lose excess weight if you have this concern.   If you have any unhealthy habits such as smoking, drinking or using recreational drugs, this would be the time to make these changes.    With support from your doctor, I suspect you will be successful.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is a huge variability with the timing of ovulation.  This is why when using contraception we use it every day, every time - pregnancy can occur when you least expect it but for most women with regular cycles of 26 to 32 days between period starts, it occurs sometime between 8 days and 19 days (start counting on the first day of your period).  Some women become very in tune with their bodies and can determine ovulation by the change in their discharge.  It becomes more noticeable and thick around ovulation.  Aside from that, the best thing to do is just continue to have regular sexual intercourse at least every other day, especially between these times if you are regular, and wait.  In most healthy young women, conception occurs within a year but anything short of that is not considered a problem.    Good luck.\n\n",

Twins come with many more risks and clomid not only results in twins but sometimes many more (triplets and beyond) which come with increased risk of miscarriage, serious preterm birth and the complications and cost associated with it.  When multiples survive, they also have an increased incidence of long-term problems.    Of course it happens spontaneously at times and you do what you can for the best outcome but it would actually be irresponsible to TRY to conceive twins when you might naturally conceive singletons with a much more likely healthy outcome.  Good luck\n\n",

    "content": "Mostly luck, random, mixed-blessing, but there is a genetic tendency too so if there are twins on your family tree, that increases your odds and later childbearing moms have them more frequently as well.  Of course, clomid helps many women conceive who do not ovulate otherwise so it is a good thing but should be used cautiously when a more natural conception has failed, recognizing the risks of multiples.  Even on clomid, most women only bear one child at a time.  This is the safest way so that's a good thing.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  A few weeks back, my boyfriend and I were in my hot tub. I kept my swimsuit on, but he had his off. While we were making out, I got on top of him and was straddling him, therefore his penis was very close to being inside of me, except I had my bottoms on. He began to thrust as if we were having sex, dry humping I guess. There is a possibility he ejaculated, but like I said, I had my swimsuit on. Is there any possibility whatsoever that I might be pregnant. After he left that night I started freaking out because I started thinking it was possible, but I know sperm can not survive in hot tub temperatures...but I didn't know if because he was so close to being completely inside of me, could it be possible that I am pregnant?  Please help..Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "You are welcome and a pregnancy test might ease your mind.  You did not actually indicated that he fully penetrated so perhaps I did not have the complete details.  If that was the case, especially if he ejaculated inside, there could be a chance of pregnancy because a swimsuit would be a limited barrier (since they can be quite skimpy) if it was merely inside along with his penis.  This is different than what I assumed you meant by \"dry humping\" as if you were having sex.   So, it really depends on the degree of exposure of sperm to vagina.  Just being in the hot tub would not kill the sperm if it is deposited inside of you.  Let us know.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The pill alone, when taken as directed, has only a 1% failure rate and condoms are similar so the chances of the two failing together, at the same time, is practically non-existent and I would expect she is not ovulating at this time.  Only time will tell if this treatment will get her ovulating once she stops the pill.  It is a standard first-line treatment and if that doesn't work there are other techniques to be tried.  Patience is in order now.   Good luck.\n\n",

If not that would be the best course of action. Once you have done this you will hopefully get a reason to why your body is behaving badly. Please go visit a physician and get checked out.   But one thing, he big clots and such can be caused because you cycles are happening so far apart and the lining of your uterus is getting really thick. So when it is time for your body to try and shed the lining, it has alot to shed which means you will get big clots. I hope this helped some in answering your question, but I feel that this is an issue best answered by your Doctor.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The reason hot tubs are a concern is because the heater keeps the temperature at a high level over a sustained period of time and your total body is submerged, which raises your core body temperature.  They do believe length of time for extremely warm temperatures can affect the sperm.  The testicles are outside the body to maintain a cooler temperature.  Normal bathing is not a concern, but if you have trouble conceiving and want to switch to showering just in case, there certainly would be no harm.  But know this, most men who bathe in a bathtub do not as a whole have fertility issues.  No more than in the average population.  Keep in mind that even in the best of circumstances it can take up to a year for pregnancy to occur in normal, healthy, fertile young couples so be patient.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Bleeding is not a typical early symptom of pregnancy - neither is abdominal pain.  Depo is a reliable method so I would not jump to this as a cause for the symptoms.  There are a number of reasons for bleeding, including hormonal fluctuation, traumatic (rough) sex, infection, cycst, polyps, fibroid tumors (benign), endometriosis.  So, if it continues she should be examined by a doctor.  Pain and bleeding can be a sign of ectopic pregnancy so even though it is unlikely, it should be ruled out.  There are also lots of other organs in the abdomen so many potential causes for pain, including bowel, urinary tract, gall bladder, appendix, etc.  This is why it would be impossible to diagnose without a checkup.  If it subsides on its own quickly it's probably nothing to worry about but if it continues or gets worse it needs to be checked out.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I cannot advise you with this limited information about what type of injection you were advised to have.  If it was RhoGam (if you were rh negative) this needed to be given shortly after birth, not just before the next pregnancy.  If you have this condition and your partner is rh positive blood type, there is some risk to your next pregnancy if you did not receive the RhoGam - not necessarily miscarriage.  If your partner is negative also, there is no reason the RhoGam is needed  (assuming you are faithful and monogamous) bu it is always recommended.    It is also possible you did not become sensitized anyway and missing the RhoGam injection did not put you at greater risk.  It is given routinely to protect just in case your baby were positive and you had some cross contamination from the bleeding.  It does not happen every time but when it does, future pregnancies could be affected - again, not necessarily because it would depend on many factors all coming into play.  If this is not your condition, I would need more information about the condition of concern.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Nipple tenderness is another symptom of either pregnancy or hormonal fluctuation and not a reliable indicator of conception.  There are many reasons for bleeding between periods.  I am doubtful this is implantation because of the timing.  Usually people report this at about the time their period would have been expected.  But, it can vary greatly from no blood at all to what almost seems like a period.    There are cases of very early miscarriage, prior to even knowing of the pregnancy and it would be difficult to say if this is the case here.  Chances are you will not continue to bleed.  If you miss your period when it is expected, take a pregnancy test.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Taking the pill religiously is a very effective method of birth control but of course there is still some rate of error - maybe one in a hundred.  Ovulation is suppressed when on the pill so you can't really predict the time you might happen to ovulate, which of course is the time you would be most likely to become pregnant.  If you did ovulate on the pill, chances are it is not on a predictable cycle anyway since it would be a random event in  and of itself.    If you missed the pill, again your cycles would not be predictable based on that event.  It's wise to use backup protection if you miss one or two until your next period.    I know this is not exactly what you were hoping to learn but it really would not be possible to predict when you might happen to ovulate while on the pill.  Your best protection is to take the pill every day around the same time and follow directions for missed pills with backup protection.  If you want to reduce even the 1% failure rate, you would use a condom every time in addition to the pill.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have read conflicting information about this, some info says that rhogam is now mercury-free and others say that rhogam with mercury is still given to expectant mothers. I have read about the increased risk of autism of an unborn child with increased mercury in your system. Also, a couple of weeks before I fell pregnant I had a flu shot, this was a standard one given through work so I would assume that it has the mercury content - is this a cause for concern? I think I had the shot on the 8th April and I conceived on around the 24th April. Thank you very much for your help.

    "title": "Re: Rhogam and Pregnancy",
    "content": "Hello, I don't know where you live but here is the statement on the FDA website:  \"The EPA has raised concerns regarding mercury exposure. These concerns have been in the context of chronic exposure to methyl mercury in milligram amounts. In contrast, blood plasma-derived products (except anti-venoms) containing ethyl mercury are usually given as one or two injections. Furthermore, the ethyl mercury content of these products is in the form of a preservative, thimerosal, which breaks down to form ethyl mercury in microgram amounts.  In the past, plasma-derived products made in multiple-use vials, e.g. Immune Globulin (Human), used for Hepatitis A prophylaxis, contained a preservative, such as ethyl mercury-containing thimerosal, to avoid contamination. This type of multi-dose presentation has been discontinued for all licensed plasma derivative products.  Rho (D) Immune Globulin (Human) products -       RhoGAM, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Inc       BayRho, Bayer Corporation       WinRho, Cangene Corporation       RhoGAM, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Inc [licensed 1968]        On April 16, 2001, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics was approved by FDA to produce RhoGAM without thimerosal, and at that time, Ortho agreed to distribute only thimerosal-free product to the US market. The product has a 2-year dating period, so there is no longer any RhoGAM that contains thimerosal that is still in-date.\"  So, it looks like, at least in the USA, thimerosal has been discontinued in the RhoGam.  The flu shot may have contained some micro-levels of preservative such as thimerosal.  The concern that has been raised is with repeated exposures that could have a cumulative effect and in conjunction with the baby shots that also contained preservatives in the past, there might be mercury-poisoning issues.  Since the thimerosal has now been discontinued as they have also discontinued multi-dose vials in most cases, you don't have that same risk.  There has not been any conclusive evidence that this is the cause of autism.  The problem is we don't know exactly what is causing the huge increase.  Very likely it is a combination of exposures that our world now presents; not just one thing.  We definitely assault our bodies with toxins that are everywhere - even in the plastics we use daily.  You may want to read about Dr. Sears' alternative schedule for immunizing children if you are worried about this.  Immunization is important but you can evaluate each vaccine on its own merits and decide whether or not you want your child to have the usual schedule or if you prefer to alter it a bit by spacing vaccinations over the course of a few years rather than getting multiple injections at one time.  Perhaps not overloading the system with too many at once will result in improved outcomes.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Finding out the odds of having a retarded baby",
    "content": "Hello, Genetic testing can only determine some types of birth defects and it would be very unlikely your family members could get a definitive answer even if they were in the states.  Unless there is a particular syndrome or condition that is genetic, causing their child's retardation, it would be hard to predict if this might happen again.  Certain conditions are suggestive of increased risks to future children but retardation alone would not predispose them to this happening a second time.  There are many possible causes for the child to have become retarded and one would need to determine the reason in this case (if it can be determined at all) in order to advise.  Your cousin might start with doing a family health history to see if there is a pattern among the relatives on either or both sides.  This can help clue you into any possible genetic problem.  Some diseases such as cystic fibrosis require both parties to carry the gene for it in order to pass it on to the  offspring.  Other diseases need only one parent to pass on the gene.  I am not familiar with anyone doing genetic testing from a distance like this.  It may be possible so perhaps someone else has a better answer on that.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I would not expect any adverse effects from suddenly stopping the pill.  You could see some hormonal fluctuation but most people do fine.  Your chances of pregnancy are probably slightly less having just completed the pill since you would not have ovulated the previous month.  Some women ovulate the next month after stopping the pill and even become pregnant right away but often it takes a few months for pregnancy to occur and ovulation to be back to normal.  So, you're asking the impossible to guess your odds here.  The last date of sex given would be the most likely in question since most women ovulate between the 8th and 19th day of their cycles.  It's anybody's guess.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your wife should be able to take acetaminophen safely.  As for other medications, some doctors recommend timing pregnancy to coincide with the time of year the allergies are not so bad, often in winter.  Then, once through the initial 3 months, many providers allow their patients to take some types of allergy medications such as antihistamines.   The safest course is to take only necessary medications in pregnancy but it is entirely possible the meds you wife may need are actually safe even at the beginning of pregnancy.  Since we do not test on pregnant women, we can't claim safety (on packaging, etc.) but over time it has been learned that there are few which truly are teratogenic (birth-defect causing).  There are teratology agencies who study these and can advise you.  Otispregnancy.org is such an organization.    Millions of women have allergies and they are able to have children so I would not be so quick to write it off in your case.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Remember that fatherhood involves so much more than impregnation or fertilization.  The donor can be matched with some genetic similarities by history, hair, eye color, height, etc.  If you concentrate on the baby belonging to both of you, regardless of who the actual donor was, you are likely to have the same bonding experience as any other parent.  It's a matter of putting your mind and heart to it.  Many adoptive parents, with no genetic ties to their offspring, report amazing similarities and have every bit a bond with their children as \"natural\" parents.  Often a father adopts his wife's children and there is a unique father-child relationship because nurturing has at least as much to do with it as nature.    Good luck.\n\n",

Test every morning when my feet hit the floor before brushing eating or anything. The entire month of October NOTHING with the saliva test. I did have ovulation pain on 17th day of my cycle but no ferning.  I continued the use of the saliva test and no ferning, but today the 2nd day of my period (cycle) I used the test and it is POSITIVE FERNING everywhere.  I do not think it is possible to ovulate during menastration but this is the only positive ferning results I have ever received.  Is this normal to have a peak in estrogen during a period or am I possibly not having a normal cycle or am I actualy ovulating?  I am so confused please help!  Thank You\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible to ovulate during menstruation, though it is rare.  I am not familiar enough with the saliva testing to interpret the results here.  If I were you I would just have regular sexual intercourse, in case you are ovulating.  There's nothing to lose by trying.  Continue to do this throughout your cycle at least every other day  since you are desiring pregnancy.  Frequency has a lot to do with improving your chances.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for your response. I live in another country and it is very helpful for me to understand some things in English and translate that to spanish in order to ask the correct questions at my doctors office here. I think it is wonderful that you take your own time to answer all of these post and it is greatly appreciated.   The saliva ovulation predictor says:  3-4 days before a women ovulates estrogen levels begin to go up and will show a slight ferning pattern. 2 days before up to the day of ovulation estrogen levels peak that cause a full ferning pattern.  The ferning pattern occurs because when estrogen levels peak the amount of salinity in a women is also higher which causes the saliva to form fern like patterns, such as frost on a window pane, that can be seen when magnified 40 to 60X.    The only day I received the ferning pattern was the 2nd day of my period.  Is it possible to have a surge in estrogen during my period?  If I am ovulating during my period would that be every month or is this just an instance where I happened to ovulate during my period? If it is every month how can you conceive during your period when the lining of the uteras will not have enough time to thicken properly for implantation? Is there a way to control ovulation with medication, if I am ovulating during my period can they give something to stop it and start it so that I can ovulate during another time of my cycle, when when the doctors feel there is a need of course?  I plan to ask my doctor all of these questions on the next visit, however being a native from the States and living in another country I like to ask for that second opinion on a matter.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Ovulating during your period is quite unusual so it is not likely to happen this way each month; I would suspect it will only be a single event or maybe occasional.  Sometimes a course of oral contraceptives is  used to help regulate a woman's cycle but you really cannot force ovulation except with ovulation stimulation medication such as Clomid.  This should only be used with a doctor's advice and only as directed.    Since there are women who conceive while on their periods, apparently there can be enough estrogen to make it work.  This is not typical, but possible.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a young woman who became sexually active roughly 6 months ago.  We used condoms for protection and every time we forgot I'd go get the morning after pill.  Finally I got the Depo shot.  Recently it was wearing off and I had been bleeding for about a week and a half.  We had sex, without protection while I was bleeding.  That was three weeks ago then I got the shot again a week after the sexual intercourse had occurred.  Now I've been getting very nauseous for a few days and my breasts are tender.  I've been getting lots of sleep but am still tired.  I'm wondering if it's possible that I might be pregnant.  I want to take a test but I feel it's too early.  I wouldn't be able to get a period until two months from now so I'm not for certain that I'm pregnant.  I have been spotting, not sure if that's normal.  Should I still take a test this early, or wait another week or so?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If she is breastfeeding exclusively the odds are considerably decreased for pregnancy to occur.  If she is not breastfeeding it is possible she could begin ovulating any time after giving birth - likely within two or three weeks at the soonest.  She can ovulate before having a normal period.  It is the unused uterine lining that is shed when an egg is not fertilized during a woman's cycle near the time of ovulation.  So, ovulation has already occurred without fertilization/conception, when she has a period.    It is wise to use protection from the outset.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would think that an MRI or scan would be the best diagnostic tools.  Your fertility specialist should be able to follow up to be sure the uterus is truly congenitally absent.  While an ovary could \"hide\" rather easily on ultrasound exam, a uterus is much larger and less likely to be missed I would think.  Of course you want to be sure but I am doubtful it is there after the examinations you have already undergone in egg harvesting.  Good luck in your efforts.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is no question that being obese can make conception more difficult so losing some excess weight would make sense.  If you are still using drugs, get off them now!  No good can come of recreational drug use when trying to conceive or when pregnant or breastfeeding.  It would also make sense to schedule a pre-conception visit with your doctor to have a general check up to see if there are any other areas of your body that needs attention prior to pregnancy.  By reducing risk factors now you can help insure a healthy baby later.  Also, take a multivitamin daily which contains at least 400 mcg folate, eat a healthy diet, and stop any other bad health habits such as smoking and alcohol.    Once you are trying to conceive you could monitor your periods and if you have a regular cycle, you can usually plan on being fertile somewhere between day 8 and day 19 of your cycle.  Those would be the days to plan on having sexual intercourse at least every other day.  Then let nature take its course.  It is considered normal for it to take up to a year for pregnancy to occur.  After that time, you may need to see a doctor to be sure there are no problems.    Best of luck to you.\n\n",

I stopped taking birth control in 05/2008 and I have had severely irregular periods throughout my life.  My OBGYN finally gave me Provera after 75 days without a period.  The bloodwork came back with testosterone levels of Total Testosterone 114 H and Freee Testosterone 16.5 H.  He said this 3x the amount it should be.  I was given another prescription for Provera 10mg to induce menstruation (today is now day 31 and he does not want it to go so long again), and a prescription for Clomid 50mg.  My glucose is fine and I have never had a problem with diabetes.  I am overweight but I eat healthfully.  I have a history of cancer.  My questions are:   What will happen having that much testosterone in my system long-term? What is the long-term treatment for PCOS? I have heard of Clomid before but are there other avenues for treatment? Are there any other tests I should investigate?  Thanks, I would really appreciate a second opinion.

    "content": "Hello, I assume you are trying to conceive; thus the clomid.  PCOS does interfere with ovulation so this can help women who desire pregnancy.  There are other medications that sometimes help such as glucophage and Metformin since insulin resistance is one of the problems with PCOS.  When you are not trying to conceive you can be treated with anti-androgens and birth control pills for hormonal regulation.  I would not expect long-term complications from excessive testosterone.  Usually the symptoms are temporary and reversible once the hormone levels stabilize.  Unwanted hair, irregular menstrual bleeding and acne are the most common effects.  Depression and diabetes can also be present so it is important to get treatment.  A very low testosterone level has been implicated in low sex drive.    This is definitely a manageable condition but it is chronic - meaning you may be dealing with it over the long term.  Losing excess weight and good nutrition, while avoiding bad habits like smoking will help.  Best wishes.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Can you detect the string?  If not, you can have your doctor check for you.   Perhaps it has moved up a bit.  I'm glad it's not bothering your husband anymore but your peace of mind might be restored if you have this checked.  As for the pain, there are many organs in the abdomen so it is impossible to say if it is serious or not.  This might be another good reason to see your doctor.  He can examine your ovaries to see if there are cysts and he might be able to determine the source of the pain.  Don't be alarmed if he/she can't because sometimes there is no obvious cause and your body may just be fighting some kind of infection or experiencing some intestinal trouble.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "You could have pain if you have a perforation but if it just shifted a bit you probably would not.  The strings can be \"sucked up\" in to where you can't feel them but because that's the only reliable method you have to be certain the IUD is in place, it is important to have it checked if you don't feel them.  Some women have reported that it is easier to locate them at the end of your period - perhaps because of cervical changes that occur around this time.  Best wishes.\n\n",

After waiting almost a month for her next period, she finally got it and was given a blood test and examination, all of which came back ok, her white blood cell count was \"slightly\" above normal but we were told this could have been caused by a recent injury.  The Doctor however, has refused to issue a prescription for the pill as my girlfriend has a very mild form of Muscular Dystrophy, a genetic disorder and he - and i quote - \"does not know if there would be any side affects because of the musculor dystrophy, please go home and do some research on the internet to see if this would be ok and present me with the results\"  I am pretty sure that the contraceptive pill could have no side effect other than the \"normal\" ones based on the person having Musculor Dystrophy, especially one that is in her case, so mild.  Can someone help?  Thanks Zach & Jas\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would recommend you getting a preconception appointment with your OB/GYN to discuss your fertility since you have not had periods.  If you prefer not to do this then the best plan is just to have regular sexual intercourse and let nature take its course.  In women less than 35 it can take up to a year to become pregnant before we would be concerned  but since you may not be ovulating as evidenced by the amenorrhea, it would be timely to have it checked out first.  Good luck and best wishes.\n\n",

On day 10 follicles were still growing and were at 12mm - 16mm, uterine lining was 14mm and estradiol was 1600 - I had a lot of pain/pressure.  We decided to try timed intercourse since the Dr. said there were about 4-6 follicles that would most likely completely mature.  Around day 12 all pain went away and I had still not ovulated according to my temperature, CM, and OPK.  On day 15 (no ovulation still), I started bleeding.  The bleeding is very dark and syrupy with a few small clots.  It is day 16 now, still bleeding and changing a tampon every 4 - 6 hours.  I am not sure if this is a big deal or not.  I've contacted my nurse but she is out on the weekends...we are also out of town right now.  Should I be concerned or have I just started my period early without ovulating?\n\n",

It is possible to become pregnant, it is just harder to predict when you ovulate.  Keep in mind that even in a person with regular periods, ovulation can occur any time over a number of days so the usual procedure for becoming pregnant is having regular sexual intercourse without worrying excessively over the exact date.    If you don't desire pregnancy, it is imperative for you to get on some reliable form of birth control because you never know when you might be at risk.  I hope you will be prepared physically, emotionally and financially when you take that step.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I thank you very much for taking your time to read this!!!!! PLEASE do not get bored with the length, i really need advise =[[[ i just don't want to leave out any details that could be important.   I'm 22 years old, female, and have been trying to conceive. It hadn't happened yet, but this month I finally noticed symptoms;    my breasts were very very tender, I was having slight unfamiliar stomache cramps, my body temperature was higher than usual to the touch (although I felt fine), I was having slight lower back aches. I didn't get my hopes up until I missed my period. Then I took TWO home pregnancy tests. They both came positive except the vertical line in the \"+\" sign that appears when it detects the hormone was slightly faint, so i looked in the pamphlet that came with the tests and it read that it didn't matter if one line was lighter or darker, the result was positive, and even gave three images as examples and mine looked just like one of them. i just figured i wasn't far enough along to get a darker reading.     so i decided to wait, then a week later (yesterday, Sept. 25) i got my period. But it was not normal. I have NEVER been late on my period or missed one, i can tell to the HOUR when it will arrive, it literally is like clockwork. But i didn't receive it until late in the afternoon, any other time i get it first off in the morning. My cramps were the same if not a worse actually and when i did finally get it, ( i chose to wear a pad inorder to monitor it better) it was just a little bleeding, it was a brown color then kind of had a pinkish tint, with continued but SLIGHT cramping in my stomache, which also isn't normal because whenever i finally do bleed my cramps stop. I only cramp the first day of my period, but today i am still slightly cramping in my stomach and my flow, was a lot heavier than it has ever been and was very dark and thick. it seemed mucousy and had dark, almost black clots.    i just need advise and a glimpse of hope. i'm tired of getting my hopes up and it's getting to be so emotional for me. is there any hope at all that they could still be results of pregnancy? maybe implantation bleeding???\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible you were experiencing implant bleeding and are still pregnant.  This is quite common.  Miscarriages are also very frequent in the early weeks if things aren't developing properly so I can't guarantee anything here.  It's kind of a watch and wait approach.  If the baby and placenta are developing the pregnancy will continue but if not there will be nothing you can do to stop a miscarriage.  It's nature's way of taking care of things that aren't as they should be physically.    You can repeat the test if you like or you can see a doctor for verification of pregnancy if it will give you peace of mind while waiting.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry to post a second question, but I'm worried about this, too.  My boyfriend and I have decided not to have sex yet, so we hump in bed while we both are wearing boxers or underwear.  He knows that I am uncomfortable with him ejaculating (since it is messy), so he refuses to \"go all the way\" unless he is really hurting and needs to.  I've tried to convince him that he should go all the way if he thinks he's going to hurt at all the next day (or if he is hurting then), but he refuses, dealing with any pain that is not extreme.  He once mentioned that he had visible blue balls, but went to bed instead of going all the way.  It's extremely sweet, but it makes me worried.  My question is this:  Is this going to hurt him?  Will it cause him to have a low sperm count or ED or any other issues in the future?  This last run lasted about two weeks when he never ejaculated, though we had been sexually active (humping) every night for about a week and a half.  He pulls off when he feels as though he is getting to a point where he wouldn't be able to stop in time, but sometimes that stopping really hurts him, too.  So is there anything I need to know?  He really wants to make sure I'm comfortable, so he tries his hardest to hold off (and does very well, it seems), but if this is going to hurt him in the future, I want to know so I can tell him and make sure that he's going all the way so he can protect himself for the future.  Please let me know, and thank you so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm sorry that was ambiguous.  I meant that this type of sexual activity (stopping before orgasm) is likely to be frustrating for him; not physically harmful.  It is no likely to affect sexual function in any way.  It will not affect sperm count either as sperm are continually produced throughout a man's life.  Women have all the eggs they will ever have all at once but men are different that way.  I hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "Abdominal cramping starts a week before period is due",
    "content": "Hello, I am new to this forum so I will introduce myself. I am 32 years old and my husband and I have started trying for a baby in February 2008. So far we have been unsuccessful. My period never used to be really painful I usually just got some abdominal cramping the day before it would start. However, something has changed dramatically in the last 3 months. Now, my period pain starts around 5 days before and increases from day to day. This is accompanied by frequent urination and back pain. It can get so bad that I will wake up in the middle of the night and then cannot get back to sleep. These symptoms start to lessen once the period starts and are almost over 2 days into my period. I also have little clots in the blood. I had an ultrasound because of this last month but the doctor found nothing abnormal. I also had my hormones checked and again, everything looks normal. While I am really happy that everything looks normal, I am feeling rather distressed about this sudden change in my monthly cycle and I do think that it requires an explanation. For example, do you think that there could be a connection between me trying to get pregnant and this sudden increase in pain? Do you think that I might have an infection? And ultimately, what do you think is causing the pain to start 5 days before my period is due? Is there something that I can look out for that might clarify the underlying cause of this? I will book anther appointment with my doctor on Monday but I would appreciate any input here because I am feeling a bit scared about this all.  Thank you, Morwong\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm glad you have consulted with a doctor about this because it's the only way you can be sure you don't have an infection or something else causing your pain.  Since the doctor sees nothing unusual this can give you peace of mind but you could have  some endometriosis or cysts causing pain that has not been evident on exam.  It does not mean you will not conceive so keep trying in the meantime.  Cramping can be normal and these things change with hormones throughout the reproductive period of a woman's life.  Good luck in your efforts.\n\n",

You only need one egg to be fertilized and travel the tube.  So, while I can't say what your particular situation is, it seems worth trying by the usual means and consulting  with a gynecologist or fertility specialist for more details about your options should pregnancy not occur spontaneously.

    "content": "Hi,  I will be 37 in Oct.  I was treated for an ectopic in Jan 08.  everything turned out fine.  My periods have not been normal since, spotting in between periods .  I've been trying to get pregnant since April and haven't been successful. I've also started to have abdominal pain 1-2 wks before I start ( which I never had before) and then it starts to subside when I start my period and 1- 2 days into it.  I went to my obgyn to discuss the irregular periods and why I haven't gotten pregnant yet and find out if there is a problem.  She had me start taking my temp in the morning for 2 mo. for ovulation. I'm almost done my 2nd month and she also had my blood drawn for thyroid, FSH and prolactin.  The thyroid is fine since i'm on meds for that but the other 2, according to the Nurse, said they read a little high.  I don't know what the numbers where and my doctor hadn't read them yet since she had been out of the office and the nurse said she will let me know what my next step will be when the doctors has a chance to look at it closely.  I've had 3 successful pregnancies which I got pregnant the 1st time on each of them, my youngest being 3 yrs old. and 1miscarriage/ectopic in Jan which took 3mo. (which doesn't seem long to try) but long for me it was.  I'm worried about the abdominal pain because is gets very painful and the spotting and also why is it taking so long?  I know that my temperature, from what I have been reading, doesn't look right.  They are very up and down for example 1 day it will be 97.2 and the next it could be 96.6.  Also both months on the the 15th day i've had a fever but felt fine (99.8) but then the next day it's 98.1.  I'm confused and can this be an easy fix such as a prescription so that I can get pregnant?  I don't want to waste anymore time since I am going to be 37.  If you have any advise or something to put my mind at ease that would be great.  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm sorry about your miscarriage and the frustration you are encountering.    You say this has been a long time you have been trying to become pregnant (and you mentioned your last one took three months which was a long time for you).  The key here is \"for you.\"  You are definitely in the normal range for it to take a while to become pregnant.  It is actually quite unusual to get pregnant on one's first attempt so you might consider that you were actually quite lucky on the others.  But, of course you are wise to have this evaluated by your gynecologist, as you are doing, because of your desire to increase your family and the biological clock is ticking.  You are still in a very safe range for pregnancy but this alone can be the cause for it to take a little longer.  You may have some hormonal fluctuation that you didn't have in the past.  Hormones change as we age and this affects your periods.    The reason you need to consult with your doctor about the temperature readings and labs is because this is just one part of the whole picture and your doctor has details of which we cannot be aware.  With your doctor's help you will likely conceive but it may take a while for this to happen.  First she is gathering information, patterns, blood results to be sure everything is functioning properly.  Treatment comes after the data is in and evaluated.  There are ovulation stimulating medications but these are not without side effects and serious risks - mostly resulting from the high rate of multiples with their associated problems including premature birth.  There is no magic pill for you to get pregnant - it's mostly the old fashioned way with patience, regular sexual intercourse and allowing nature to take its course.  But, of course if something is truly standing in your way, the work your doctor is doing will most likely bring it to light so if intervention is needed you can get it.  These days there are methods that can help but these are only used after it is determined they are indicated.    Stay with your doctor on this and take the time needed to get your questions answered by her.  Good luck.  Best wishes to you in this effort.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: trying to get pregnant w/ second child",
    "content": "Hello, It is considered typical to take a year to become pregnant in a fertile woman who is not on birth control and who has regular sexual intercourse.  Intervention is not usually recommended until the year has passed.  In this case the year would actually start with your miscarriage forward.  By age 35 it is recommended that a woman seek testing after six months of trying since her fertility may be diminishing with age.  The fact that it took a year and a half for your first pregnancy does imply you may not be ovulating every month, but this is not particularly important.  The fact you have conceived twice is very encouraging.  Try not to worry too much about the technicalities of ovulation, enjoy having regular sexual relations with your husband and relaxing like this may actually put your body in a better frame for pregnancy than the stress of worrying, planning, charting and measuring, which could increase your stress hormones and actually interfere.  When the body perceives stress and risk, ovulation is suppressed as part of the natural self-preservation of the species.    If you do want to plan for most success, and if you have regular 26 to 32 day periods, you should plan to have sex especially between days 9 and 20 when you start counting with the first day of your period.  Most likely you will ovulate somewhere during that time.  Some fertility experts recommend having intercourse every other day during the potentially fertile period and feel this is better than daily, but don't stress over it if you want to have sex the next day after you did before.  It doesn't matter if you know exactly when you ovulate, there is a range here.  You may notice an increase of secretions which could signal ovulation, so be sure to have sex at that time.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, A history of uterine polyps is one of several factors that increase your risk of endometrial cancer, especially after the age of 50.  Keep in mind though that these polyps are very common and most women do not develop cancer later.    Having had the polyps removed improves your chances for achieving pregnancy and, though there is a chance of some scarring which could interfere with implantation I would not expect this to be a big risk, having removed nine polyps (these are usually quite small).  The surface area available for implantation should still be adequate.    Polyps can occur again in the future but it is uncommon, so try not to worry too much about this.  Your thyroid treatment should not affect your pregnancy as long as you are checked periodically as your medication may need adjustment during your pregnancy.  Good luck with your efforts to conceive and bear a child.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Of course I don't know the details of  your case, how severe this is or if there are other concerns, but this should not affect you becoming pregnant.  You could have more discomfort in pregnancy and for this reason I would suggest getting chiropractic care to see if you can get things in better alignment even now.  Many women are able to have more comfortable pregnancies when they are also under the care of a chiropractor for the spine and bone alignment during pregnancy and some feel that their delivery goes more smoothly as well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Pre-conception moderate alcohol use is not considered to be detrimental to the baby.  If you were a heavy drinker (as in alcoholic) you would want to give your body time to be clear of alcohol, as well as the addictive problem since you would likely be unable to avoid it during pregnancy unless you mastered going dry first.    Binge drinking is another matter and we do not know what possible long-term effects could be involved with this - even with a single binge episode.  So, a huge drinking binge to celebrate the pregnancy would not be a good idea.  The drink to relax you when trying to conceive is most likely not going to be a problem.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Even though you are very anxious for a child, patience is what is called for here.  Your body may regulate itself hormonally if you give it a while to do so.  That is why your doctor has prescribed the pill.  Give it time to do its thing, then you may find a return to ovulation.  If not, clomid may be something your doctor will be willing to try but it is not without risk since multiples occur more frequently and with this come serious health concerns and the very real risk of a preterm delivery and sick baby.  The clomid stimulates ovulation in a woman who is not ovulating every month.  But, it can stimulate more than one follicle - hence, increased risk of multiples.  This medication should only be used exactly as prescribed and only for the period the doctor advises.  This is very important should they decide you are a candidate for this treatment.    I assume the doctor has checked you for PCOS (Polycystic ovary syndrome) but another condition that sometimes interferes with periods is endometriosis.  This can be more difficult to diagnose.  Meanwhile, try to work on other ways to prepare for being a parent.  Take vitamins daily, make sure you eliminate any bad and unhealthy habits such as smoking, drinking, drugs.  Use a seatbelt every time you are in the car, eat a healthy diet (learn to like vegetables if you don't already), lose any excess weight you may have and exercise.  This can also help you to regulate your blood glucose which can also interfere with ovulation.    Plan financially to get ready for the extra costs involved in having a baby, paying medical bills and preparing for college.  Try to enjoy the time you have together as a couple that you will not have again for many year once the baby comes.  Enjoy the time, rather than being miserable because you want to be in a different place right now.  Also, relish the ability to sleep all night and sleep in in the morning.  This is a temporary condition.  If you or your husband could benefit from additional education for job improvement, this would be a good time to focus on that.  All this will help you to be psychologically, physically and financially prepared for parenthood.    Many couples do have to wait a while but find the reward is worth it when they finally do get their child.     Good luck\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Size has nothing to do with it.  The sperm swim so as long as the penis is inserted into the vagina when you ejaculate, this is all that is necessary.  Some fertility specialists advocate having the woman remain still with hips slightly elevated after sex to make the most of gravity and you may want to watch her cycle to time your sexual activity with her most fertile days (day 8 through 19 typically with the 14th day being the most likely time for someone with a regular cycle of around 28 days).    It is not unusual for it to take up to a year to achieve pregnancy, even when actively trying.  After a year, they usually recommend getting fertility testing done.  You could see a urologist for a sperm count - quite easily done.  If that is normal, your partner could also see a gynecologist to see if they see anything unusual with her cycle, etc.    Good luck to you.\n\n",

When I visited my doctor to get treated for UTI he wanted to make sure I was not pregnant before he administered me medicines. I had my beta-hcg works done. The doctor says results are negative. Will Beta-hcg be reliable 4 days past ovulation or so early in the cycle? Is there chances I'm still pregnant. The reason I ask is because, I have been administered antibiotics for treating UTI and some people say it could be troublesome for pregnancy.  Kindly let me know about the beta-hcg result and how early can it be tested. Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, About three weeks after your last menstrual period the levels can be measured.  Don't worry about the antibiotics.  Anything they would give you for a UTI is likely OK in pregnancy.  Most antibiotics are safe for short-term use, such as an infection, and have not shown any increase in birth defects.  A few of the tetracycline or doxycycline-type drugs are not used but the greatest concern with these is in long-term use.    Many of the drugs that might be in question are in a category of caution just because there has not been enough data to prove safety or they may have been shown to be associated with problems in animal studies.  This does not mean they are unsafe in humans.  Pregnant women are not used in studies for drug safety so information is always limited.  But there are teratology organizations that track information anecdotally and can assure us they appear to be safe.  This is because large numbers of pregnant women who took the drugs, either because they needed them or didn't know they were pregnant.  Information was obtained after their babies were born and no increase of problems was observed.  Your doctor was wise to check for pregnancy in looking out for your overall health and it may have influenced his decision but since you weren't receiving a strong chemotherapy chances are even if you were pregnant, there would be no problem.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Either scenario is possible here.  Since the NuvaRing is hormonal, it can result in changes in your period and discharge.  But, since you had sex prior to the NuvaRing during a potentially fertile time, it could also be due to pregnancy.  The only way to know is to do another pregnancy test or two.  Usually the ring is started with the period to be sure you are not already pregnant.    Early pregnancy tests can be falsely negative so it's usually good to repeat the test a week or two later.  If still negative, most likely you are not pregnant.  A few women have very slow rising HcG levels so they persist with negative tests, but this is not common.    Good luck in your efforts to conceive when the time is right.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, With clothes on during sex, pregnancy is not possible.  However, just because he does not think there is pre-ejaculate does not mean it is not there so there is always the possibility pregnancy could occur if there is penetration.  The \"pull out\" method of birth control is not especially effective because of this.    Stress can cause a delay in your period so this could be what is happening.  Worry about pregnancy is a common cause of stress.  Of course, it is also a sign of possible pregnancy so I would get a pregnancy test.  The home tests are usually reliable at about a week after your period was due to start.  If the test is negative and you still don't have a period, repeat the test one to two weeks later or you can have a blood test done in the doctor's office.  These are more sensitive.    If you are not pregnant, I would recommend that you find a reliable form of birth control you can both be comfortable with.  You don't need his kind of monthly stress.  Let us know if you have other questions.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is not a very promising report.  Sometimes there are temporary conditions to affect sperm but there are no drugs to help.  If the final testing is still this way, you may want to consider using donor sperm to achieve pregnancy.  Nobody needs to know this is the case (family and friends, etc.).  Some people are opposed to this procedure but many babies are conceived this way and loved by both parents!  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Spotting is very common in early pregnancy.  All you can do is watch and see because it can be a sign of miscarriage in some cases.  Even so, there is little to be done.  If a miscarriage is imminent, we haven't found anything to really make a difference.  Usually they occur because something is not developing properly with the fetus and we can't help that.  If you start cramping and bleeding heavily, that is likely a miscarriage.  Some continued spotting can still result in a healthy pregnancy.  Good luck.\n\n",

If you do not have insurance, you can ask your family practice doctor for a referral or just look in your telephone book or ask a local hospital for a referral.  Good luck.\n\n",

My husband was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and has been on regular medication for the last 4 years. Medication includes MST Continus 90mg x2 a day, trazodone, 5mg diazepam a day, sertraline daily. He used to have 60mg citalopram until October. We were wondering if the medication is causing us problems to conceive. He is also over-weight, but this is due to his condition which causes him to be inactive and not his diet. We are both non smokers and gave up for good 5 years ago.  We feel too embarassed and it would be upsetting to go to our GP and ask for a test to see if one of us can no longer have children. Although we have 2 children already, we have always wanted more. I hope people don't think we are greedy wanting more, when i know some people cant have any.  K\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You are certainly not greedy in wanting to enlarge your family.  You should do what feels right to you and most people will rejoice in your success when it comes.  Even those who cannot achieve can be happy for those who are so blessed that way.  Congratulations to you both for your success in quitting tobacco.  What a wonderful gift this is to your children, both in physical health and example.  As for the medications - none of these listed would typically cause infertility, assuming your husband is not having erectile dysfunction, which sometimes occurs with medications.  If he is able to perform adequately, it is unlikely related to his meds.  Some anti-cancer drugs can do this but the ones you have listed are not known to affect this.    I hope you will reconsider seeing someone about possible infertility since there are many treatments available to help in this.  Yours would be considered secondary infertility since you have conceived children together before.  But, many conditions can come into play here.  Hormones can fluctuate.  I would recommend having a sperm analysis done.  This is relatively easy and done through a urologist.  You should have a checkup with your gynecologist to be sure everything is in order there, including thyroid.  Your doctor can evaluate for other possible causes of infertility such as PCOS, endometriosis, etc. based on the exam and your history.    If you have been actively trying to conceive for less than a year, it is likely that it still may occur spontaneously.  If it has been more than a year, you may need to see about  getting some help here.  If you are found to be not ovulating regularly, hormones can help.    Good luck with your efforts.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: My most fertile days and when to have sex making a baby",
    "content": "Hello, When counting the days of your menstrual cycle, you begin with the first day of bleeding and count that as day one, then proceed daily until the first day of  your next period.  This is the space between your periods.  Most women are fertile somewhere around the 14th day if they have regular 26 to 32 day cycles, but it can actually be at any time, especially in a young woman such as yourself.  We generally think of days 8 through 19 as potentially fertile days and the others as less likely.    Once you miss a period by a few days to a week (assuming you are regular) you can take a home pregnancy test.  Follow the directions exactly and they are quite accurate - not 100% but pretty reliable.  You may also have other signs such as tender breasts, nausea, and tiredness.  You should be taking a daily multivitamin right now containing at least 400 mcg folate or folic acid and continue this once pregnant and throughout your childbearing years.    I hope you are thinking about the emotional and financial factors in having your first baby as well.  Are you both ready for the lifelong commitment that comes with having a child?  Sometimes it seems like a good idea but in reality many young parents wish they had waited a while to get their own relationship (even marriage) stabilized before adding the stress of a baby who cries a lot, needs attention and care constantly, will at times get sick and keep you up all night.  It takes a high level of emotional intelligence and maturity to handle the demands of a baby.  Stressed out parents who are not prepared put their children at risk.  Be wise.  Big decisions like this one should not be made impulsively or without really examining all the factors.  Once you are pregnant you should make an appointment with a doctor to be seen by the 13th week and you must keep all your prenatal care appointments.  I also recommend childbirth preparation classes offered by your hospital.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I have a question that I have read multiple answers to and wanted the opinion of the physicians here.  My Husband (28 years old) had the flu two weeks ago.  I took his temperature at one point and it was 101.something and the fever broke that same night.  I have read that a \"moderate\"fever can affect sperm and we probably will not be able to concieve for 3 months because of this.  My first question is how high must a fever be to cause potential fertility problems? Second question is, is there any truth to the the idea that fever will cause fertility problems? Lastly, If a fever can cause fertility problems, how long after the fever will be be affected (the very next day or the next month)?  And how long will it be until the sperm is back to normal? Thank You so much. Laurie\n\n",

I know of know documented information to indicate at what point any potential danger might be passed.  Your husband's fever was not high (considered low grade actually) and not prolonged so I would not expect any repercussions from it.  Good luck in your efforts here.\n\n",

    "title": "Safe Zone in Menstrual Cycle",
    "content": "Hello - I just hope this does not only get read, but also gets me sound advice! I am a 28yr old asian woman (we evidently have a tendency to conceive at the drop of a hat!!) - my fiance and i are sexually involved -althu on a sporadic basis seeing as i travel for work as does he. If we are lucky, we get to be together 2/3 months in a month.  We plan on getting married by July this year and till then (and for a year or so over) we don't plan on parenthood.  My concerns have recently been heightened with working out when its safe for us to have sex without fear of my getting pregnant. Yes, the asian society is very conservative about shotgun weddings!  My periods were fairly regular. I did have 35-40day cycles in my late teens but for the past 2/3 years ive been rather regular in so far as my dates are concerned.  Brief history of my period dates/cycle:  4th November 2007  3rd December 2007  1st January 2008  Each period lasts 4 days - i go heavy on the first and second days. Start slowing down by evening of 3rd day and by 4th im either all clear or very slightly on the rag.   Now - in january 2008, my fiance was in town and the two of us had just one night to be together. The nite of 5/6th Jan.  We got busy.  He doesnt wear condoms. (He cant perform with them - actually cant.) I am on no contraceptive plan. The pill scares me. I already have heavy hips. And the side-effect indicating pills increasing hip-width, weight and hair growth has put me off the idea of touching the pill!  Normally he doesn't ejaculate in me, but this night i asked him too - reckoning i was so within my safe zone seeing as i had just finished my period a day before.   To still play safe, i took the morning-after/emergency pill the following day.   And then my period disappeared! I went thru so many home-pregnancy kits!!   And then i got my period on the 13th of Feb'08.   Stretching my normally one month cycle to a 44day cycle.   Freak incident? Stress? (I lost my father in december...work has been busy...and to lose myself into sheer exhaustion so i can sleep, i go for an intense workout everyday of the week)   Whatever the reason - i don't want a repeat performance of anxiety levels that we both touched caused by the delay in my period.   Henceforth - when are safe zones? If i want to be with him this weekend, am i pushing my luck?   I will be so grateful if i could be taken through this zoning crisis!   Look forward to any input!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If you and your fiance are both agreeable you could be a candidate for Cycle Beads.   This is a natural family planning method that is quite reliable for women with normal periods and who are in a relationship where both parties have good self control and are committed.  The days 8 through 19 (start counting on the first day of your period) are considered \"unsafe\" or likely fertile days.  What this means is that you are likely to ovulate sometime during those days but nobody knows exactly which so if you have sexual intercourse during these days it would be wise to use some form of birth control.  You might consider a diaphram or spermacidal jelly at least if you are opposed to other methods.    The \"beads\" can be purchased very reasonably and are used as a visual guide to fertile days so you keep them at your bedside and move a little ring along the beads each day to remind you which day you are on your cycle.  These are available on the internet.  The success rate here is actually quite comparable to other methods.    Likely your period was messed up due to the high concentration of hormones in \"plan B\" or emergency contraception.  You may want to consider taking the pill.  There are many formulations and side effects can be very minimal.  An IUD is another option since you plan on waiting a while to start a family.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "*I will refer to my significant other as a he, however, birth records would say he is a she.  My significant other is, we assume, a pseudohermpahrodite. Bloodwork would say that he is male because of the very high tesosterone levels. A previous, brief, and somewhat illegal doctor's visit with some bloodwork surprised the doctor when he said he was female because of the testosterone levels. His outer genitalia is female, but he builds muscle like a male, and gender reassigned himself to a male. Based on the research i've done I have guessed that he possibley has testicles in his abdominal cavity. He has high sensitivity in his lower abdomen and becomes highly aroused when pressure is applied. We haven't explored this through a doctor any further, but we will in a few months when he turns 18 and we can get his less than supportive mother out of the picture.  My question is: If I was correct that he has testicles in his abdomen, is it possible that his semen can be produced through his female genitales and is it possible that the semen is fertile? Could he get a woman pregnant?\n\n",

If they are surgically repaired and brought down while young, fertility may be preserved.  If pregnancy is desired in his female partner, it would be likely an artificial means might be required such as donor sperm.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  My husband and I are trying to have a baby so we had a sperm analysis done(Krueger Strict.)  The results were as follows:  the volume was 4.5cc, total count was 195.3 million, the motility was 72% and the Kruger morphology was only 4% and the WHO morphology was 27%. I know the morphology is low but will my husband's high sperm count and motility help even out the low morphology?  I figured with that low of a morphology out of the 195.3 million sperm 7.8 million are of good quality.  Is that enough to get pregnant naturally?  We have only been trying to get pregnant for 2 months.  He was told to take 1000 mg of vitamin C, 400 IU of Vitamin E and a multi vitamin.  We will do another sperm analysis almost 3 weeks after the last one.  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Motility can vary widely even within the same man so this alone does not mean a lot.  This is a good reason to have a second analysis done.  It is helpful in connection with the other studies and yes, antioxidants such as vitamin C and E have been shown to help this condition.  Eating lots of colorful fruits and vegetables is a very good idea.  Taking them as food as well as supplements can only help his overall health anyway.  Many people absorb vitamins in their natural state as food better than in pill form anyway.    I would feel quite optimistic.  It can take about a year for a young, sexually active, fertile woman to become pregnant even under the best of circumstances.  You didn't mention your age but it sounds like you are in good hands for your reproductive future.  Good luck.\n\n",

Pregnancy can actually relieve many of the symptoms of endometriosis because it stops the normal monthly cycling of hormones.  Unfortunately, sometimes after delivery the endometriosis issues return.  Usually a home pregnancy test is accurate during the 4th to 5th week after the last period.  You can use one of these before your next visit if it has been long enough.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Should i get a sperm scheck or what ever it is called or just try more. Should i take testostrome pills to boost me up cause i think it is cause of that. i barely have facial hair cause of lack of testostrome right could that also be from too much masterbation. well looking forward to an response . thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I can assure you that the history of masturbation has not caused you to have a decrease of testosterone.  If you have a hormonal problem, it would not be caused by that activity.  I would not recommend anything you can buy over the counter to boost testosterone as I know of nothing available that truly is reliable.  You must see a doctor to assess the need for hormones.  You could see either a urologist or endocrinologist for that.    Drugs, alcohol and tobacco use may decrease a man's fertility so stopping these habits may help and it could take a little time for the effects to be reduced to non-use levels.     There are many causes of infertility so you may need to see a fertility specialist if your semen analysis is in the normal range but that would be a very good place to begin.    Good luck in this endeavor.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  I'm hoping you can help me. In July I had a very short period (2 days) where it was very dark and abnormal. August, I got my period on schedule from the 8th through the 13th. It was normal. I did not get my period at all in September. I attributed it to stress since I had just become engaged, school was starting up again, and I had started a new job. I did finally get my period in the middle October, although I can't tell you the exact days. I have not had my period since. Nothing in November, and we are now halfway through December. Needless to say, I'm freaking out. Pregnancy tests are all negative.  I don't know if this is related at all, but since August I have had crazy acne--unlike anything I have ever had before. I've never had a problem with acne before, so it seems extremely odd.   On the months I've missed my period, including this month, I feel faint cramping and nothing else. It just never comes!   My mother has a history of ovarian cysts and endometriosis. I'm scared that something like this could be happening to me. I find it odd that the weirdness seems to occur every other month...maybe one of my ovaries is dying? Perhaps I have no idea what I'm talking about.  I hope you can give me some insight. My doctor is booked through this month and can only schedule me in January. Meanwhile, I'm clueless as to what is going on in my body. I do not feel stressed, I'm not pregnant...I don't know what else it could be.  Thank you for any insight you may have. I realize I need to go to a doctor to get an accurate diagnosis.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You should have no greater risk than without the antibiotics.  The primary way the IUD works is not hormonal - the hormone is an added bonus protection but IUDs without the hormone also have a very good success rate for preventing pregnancy.    Also, the problem with antibiotic use while on hormonal contraceptives has been somewhat disputed for most antibiotics.  There are a few, such as Rifampin, primarily used for tuberculosis that can affect the birth control effectiveness but most have been found to not interfere.  So, you really don't need to be overly alarmed - at least no more so than usual since all birth control except abstinence does have a small failure rate, especially when not used correctly. One advantage to the IUD is you don't get human error as a factor so your method works more consistently than some other methods.  Best wishes and Happy Holidays!\n\n",

I've had that treatment before and it didnt help one bit. Does inflamation affect fertilty?  On top of the painful pap smear, I'm in almost constant pain on the left side of my vagina. It feels like something is inside trying to pushout, especially at the beginning of intercourse but my Dr acts like its nothing.I told my Dr., but he seems to think it's the inflamation. My periods are pretty regular so I don't think its PCOS. Where is the pain coming from? Please help!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is the possibility of endometriosis and this is not usually something your doctor can detect with routine pap smears and exams.  Your symptoms could be consistent with this condition.  Women with endometriosis experience pain differently because it all depends on where the implants occur.  Infertility is also a common effect from this.  I should mention though that it is considered normal for it to take a year or more to become pregnant even in ideal circumstances.  But, because you have pain, it might be worth checking out to see if there is an underlying cause to your inability to become pregnant.  Inflammation has been implicated in infertility in some studies so the bacterial vaginosis may be contributing to your problem.  If you are not comfortable with the level of care you are receiving you can request a second opinion and see a gynecologist.      Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I had blood test done on the weekend to test my hormones, as I am trying to concieve. I had a miscarriage and D&C in July, then bled on and off for a few months (my periods would come every couple of weeks). I then had one regular 29 day cycle, and since have not had another one (I'm about 50 days in now). The tests came back and the doctor told me the results over the phone, it was very medical and didn't help much. She said my ratio of hormones that regulate ovulation is about 2.5 to 1, meaning it is high, and this is consistant with PCOS, so I'm guessing that the male hormone in my body is higher than normal. My cholesterol and estrogen are fine, and I am a very healthy weight, BMI of about 18.7, no excess hair growth, baldness or other symptoms of PCOS. She said my progesterone levels are low so I haven't ovulated in this cycle yet, is that true? Does all mean that I actually have PCOS? Or could it be something else? I've heard that Vitex is good for balancing out hormones, does this work for PCOS? Is there a way to manage this so that it isn't as hard for me to concieve again?  Any help would me much appreciated. Thank you very much for your time, and what you do for the people on this site.  I'm 22 years old, female, not on any medications (I went off the Pill in med february this year), surgery: D&C July 26. No real family histories of illnesses.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Not all women have the same symptoms even though they have PCOS.  But, it can interfere with conception.  I do question your healthy weight however.  A BMI of 18.7 is actually just barely underweight.  This is not typical of PCOS but it can also contribute to amenorrhea (absence of periods).  If your body perceives inadequate fat stores to support a pregnancy, it naturally suppresses ovulation.  It might be helpful for you to gain weight in your efforts to conceive.  This doesn't mean lots; but maybe 5 or 10 pounds would help.    You are right about the hormones. The cysts make male hormones, which prevent ovulation. You would also be lacking in progesterone which results in the absence of periods.    There are treatments available to manage the syndrome; not to cure it.  Glucophage or Metformin is often used to regulate insulin, lowering the production of testosterone.  This is not its intended use but it is often successful and women with PCOS frequently become pregnant with just this intervention.  There are other medications such as anti-androgens and birth control pills but these are not desired when you want to conceive.  Other treatments include a surgical procedure, eating a healthy, low-sugar diet for glucose control, and fertility medications to stimulate ovulation.  The latter comes with side effects, one of the most common being multiple births with the related risks.  Stay in touch with your doctor for the treatment that is best for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  I am a female of just about 20.  I went out this weekend with a guy friend to celebrate my birthday.  We both got a little tipsy and we ended up having sex.  I always make my partners wear a condom, and he did, but upon ejaculation, the condom broke real bad.  Now, this occurred on the last day of my menstruation (my cycle is rather light) and I took my first Birth Control Pill (Tricyclen) of the month today.  Should I get to the drugstore and pick up Plan B?  Or am I okay?  I have been on the pill for 2 something years.  Please let me know ASAP because I only have another 54ish hours before Plan B will not be an option.  Thanks in advance.\n\n",

If your periods are pretty regular and of average spacing (26-32 day cycles), you can feel pretty safe, though never 100% sure (even with birth control, some pregnancies do occur).  So, it would seem you were still in the \"safe\" time frame.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Birth control pills work in several ways, the primary being suppression of ovulation so there is no egg shed during the month.  The hormones are manipulated so you still shed the unneeded endometrial lining.  As for using a condom - it should not be necessary at any time for pregnancy prevention if you are taking the pills regularly, not missing days, etc.  But, there are other reasons for using one since it can decrease your risk of getting a sexually transmitted infection.  In casual relationships this is especially important.    However, if you want to try to reduce the 1-2% risk of pregnancy that comes with oral contraceptive methods, you could be diligent about using a back up method such as a condom, particularly on cycle days 8 through 19.  Start counting on the first day of your period to determine when that is.  This is based on a typical 26 to 32 day cycle.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, On the 26th July I had a dilation and curettage procedure as I had missed miscarried. For a few months I was very irregular - having my period every 10-14 days. The last 6-8 weeks have shown my body to have settled down a bit but I am spotting between my periods now. I am due for my menstural cycle in about 5 days, and I have been spotting now for about 6 days. About 6-8 weeks ago I had a pelvic ultrasound to see if there was any foetal tissue left behind after the procedure but the results came back normal. I'm concerned about endometriosis...If I have endometriosis would that have shown up in the pelvic ultrasound I had? I am very keen to start trying for a baby again. What could be wrong? Or is it still my hormones settling down after being pregnant and going through such a procedure. I am 22 years old, and this was my first pregnancy. I am not on any medications, and the currette was the first operation I have ever had.\n\n",

    "content": "I suspect you are right about this just being your body settling.  It can take a few months.    Endometriosis can be quite tricky to diagnose and while the ultrasound could help to rule out other pelvic conditions and possibly suggest endometriosis, it is not diagnostically reliable alone.  Laparascopic surgery is the only really good tool for diagnosis.  If you plan to conceive soon, the best thing to do is to embark on a course of regular sexual intercourse and taking care of yourself physically.  Take a multivitamin containing at least 400 mcg folate or folic acid NOW because it does the most good to prevent birth defects when it is in adequate quantity from conception onward.  If this natural course doesn't result in pregnancy within the year you may want to inquire further in case there is endometriosis that might be interfering.  But, lots of women conceive spontaneously in spite of endometriosis.  Good luck.\n\n",

While they are settling down, does it mean that I am still ovulating? Is it safe to concieve while my body is still adjusting? I just don't want to go through another miscarriage if I can avoid it, and if that means I have to wait then I'll wait.   Also, this spotting is giving me very faint cramps...like menstural cramps, but they are very dull. Is that a normal symptom of spotting and my condition?  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Most of the time spotting of this nature is normal and need not have attention unless it goes on for several cycles - in that case it could be a sign of a cervical inflammation and might require antibiotic treatment.  As for pregnancy concerns, even if this is hormonal it is not something that would make me worry about increasing your risk of miscarriage.    In most women miscarriage is a single event, thought to be caused by a chromosomal abnormality that triggers it because the baby is not forming properly.  It is totally random in most cases and chances are the next pregnancy will be fine.  In a woman with a second or third miscarriage, it is more likely to be caused by some identifiable problem (perhaps 50% of cases) and there is some chance of being able to intervene hormonally.  But, even then, half the cases will have no recognizable cause.    If your body is still adjusting hormonally but you are ovulating, it may not be clear just when it occurs, but it should not be a problem if you do conceive.  If your progesterone levels are inadequate, that may be a factor in some miscarriages but it has not been proven that intervention helps.    In essence, it is impossible to prevent a miscarriage in most cases.  The best we can hope for is some reduction of risk by making sure the body is in good physical health, eating right, taking a multiple vitamin, avoiding drugs, alcohol and tobacco.  In the case of repeat miscarriages, an OB/GYN may be able to determine some factor that is causing it, thereby opening a door to possible treatment options.  For you, chances are that this was a random event.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Basilbonnet,  The best way to stop taking birth control pills is to finish the pack you are on now.  This way you will not have any irregular bleeding in the middle of your cycle.  After you have completed your cycle of pills and you normal period starts, you can attempt to get pregnant.  Some advise that you wait until your first period off of the pill to try and conceive, but this is no always needed.  Some people get pregnant 1-2 weeks after stopping birth control pills.  So, going off the pill should not affect your chances of getting pregnant and being on the pill long term also should not prevent you from conceiving.    Good Luck Sandy RN\n\n",

    "content": "I would add that it is not necessary to flush the pill out for several months.  It is not toxic.  Even people who conceive while taking the pill have no adverse effects from the hormone in their body.  It usually prevents conception but if pregnancy occurs, you discontinue the pill but don't worry about it having caused birth defects or anything.  The hormones used are the same that occur naturally.  Some people find that it sometimes takes a few months to become pregnant after being on the pill but plenty of women conceive the month following so not a lot to worry about there.  Good luck in your efforts.\n\n",

Not too long after I had my son a condum broke on my husband and I and as I was only 18 at the time I did NOT want to even chance another baby so soon so I went to the local clinic and was given plan B and was told that it is the exact same thing as taking 5ish birthcontrol pills all at once. So that's what I did when I got home that night. I know that you can't say \"no, there's no way you're pregnant\" but what I was looking for is if there is a good chance of it or a really slim chance that I'm pregnant. Thanks.\n\n",

The physician that ordered the test is a military flight doctor who could not answer any of our questions nor tell us what we should do at this point. Normal range in paranthesis. Semen color - opaque viscosity - increased volume 3.0 mL (1.5-5.0) semen, ph 8.0 (7.0-7.6) init % motility 50 % (60-100) 2 hr motility 30% (60-70) sperm count - test not performed Unable to perform testing/specimen did not liquify within 4 hours stained morph 85% (70-100)  We have been trying to get pregnant for almost a year now.  My questions are?  What does the comment on liquifying mean and could this affect the motility?   I know for low sperm counts there are standard suggestions physicians make, I couldn't find anything on motility though.  Are there ways to increase your motility? How difficult would this make getting pregnant?  Is it still possible? What is the next step?  Should we have the test re-run?  What type of specialist should we ask the flight doctor to refer us to? By the way, does the laying on your back with your feet in the air thing really help?  Can my OB help with this because the flight doctor is really over worked and unlikely to take the time to answer our questions or do anything to help us since it doesn't affect my husband's ability to fly.

    "content": "Yes, your OB could most likely help you to understand the results and definitely would be more qualified than I am.  I do know that a longer liquefying time could indicate infection.  Initial motility does not look too bad at 50% with normal at 60% but of course it can make a difference to fertility anyway.  Without a sperm count, it would be difficult to even guess here.  By way of information, it is considered normal for it to take a year for a young, sexually active, fertile woman to become pregnant, even if all factors are present and favorable.  There is a certain element of luck involved as the sperm must travel to the right place, at the right  time, be strong enough to penetrate and fertilize the egg, then the ovum must be able to implant into a favorably prepared uterus.  When you think about it, it's nothing short of a miracle that so many people do get pregnant quite easily.    Good luck in your efforts.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 29 year old female.  I have been diagnosed with PCOS and I am trying to get pregnent.  My Dr. sugested fertility pills but wants to get my cycle regulated first.  I have never had a normal cycle, sometimes i go for 2 to 3 month and do not have one at all and sometimes i have 2 or 3 in one month.  My dr. gave me provera to regulate my cycle and told me to start it on Oct. 1st if i did not start my regular cycle, but it was on time for once, the only problem is that i have not stoped and i don't know what i should do about taking the pills on the first of next month.  Should i take them when it comes time or skip them because i have had such a long cycle this time.  Should i take the pills to make me stop or just let it run its course.  Im confused please help.\n\n",

Good luck in your efforts at pregnancy.  May I also suggest that you take a good daily multivitamin containing at least 400 mcg folate or folic acid. This has been shown to prevent birth defects when it is on board early in the pregnancy (from time of conception on).  All women of childbearing age should be doing this but especially if you are preparing your body for a planned pregnancy.\n\n",

About 15-20 min later i licked mi finger and start to masturbate with it, but only tuching my clitoris.

I'm an 18 year old male, and recently had sex with a girl using a condom. After ejaculation, I removed the condom, and about a half hour later we were 'playing around' again. At one point my penis was inserted into her vagina again without a condom, but was immediately taken out after, with no penetration and without ejaculating again. I know sperm cells don't die for several days, so I am somewhat worried what this could do. Is there a chance that this could cause pregnancy, and if so are the chances high? Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Any time you have penetration (assuming both you and the girl are fertile) there is the possibility of pregnancy.  How high the likelihood?  I would say not very based on what you have shared, but if it happened to be at the time she was ovulating or near that time and there was sperm present (in pre-ejaculate) it could happen.  So, the planets would need to align, but it is not likely.  If she were to become pregnant from this encounter, it would be quite unusual and unexpected.  But, half of all pregnancies in the USA are unplanned for one reason or another so we can't be completely sure.  Your girlfriend may want to consider a second form of birth control such as the pill to safeguard against such a risk in the future.  Condoms are somewhat protective against disease so this is a good choice as primary contraception.      Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "My girlfriend and I have been together for awhile. Last weekend we were together one night and although we have decided to not have sex we do fool around. We were masterbating each other and i stuck my hand down my own pants to readjust myself, i felt a little pre cum on my fingers but didnt think any of it. So we went back to masterbating each other and i was fingering her with the fingers that had the precum on it. Now i did whipe my hands on her panties and sweat pants, but i don't know if this got it off. So that is my first worry. My second worry is we were under a blanket and she had made me ejaculate. I think some may have hit her on her vagina but im not sure and niether is she. I read up and on multiple sites it said that there is a chance of pregnancy there. So if some of my sperm were to hit her vagina over her panties the sites said there may be a chance of pregnancy. My third worry is after all this, later that night we \"dry humped\" with our clothes on, i was in boxers and she was in pajama pants and panties. I could feel the tip of my penis go into her a little bit, but not alot, and my sweat pants were a little wet on the outside where my penis was from pre cum afterwards. I was humping her kind of hard for maybe about 4-5 minutes.  With all the terms i just listed, could there be any possible chacnes of me getting my girlfriend pregnant?\n\n",

It is necessary for the ejaculate or pre-ejactulate to enter the vagina in order to travel to the location of conception.    The chance of sperm transfer through clothes is practically impossible, however.    Since you are clearly on the verge of sexual intercourse, it would be wise for you to employ a reliable method of birth control so you are prepared should you reach a point where you actually do engage in actual intercourse.  Being prepared does not mean you are planning to break your comitment, but you will be more confident should you slip up.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "That sounds like a good plan.  It's always a good idea to think about your future reproductive plans and to make decisions now to protect that important part of your health and life.    Be aware that sexual decisions made now can also affect you in the future, so use caution.  Also, all young women of reproductive age should take a multivitamin every day which contains folic acid.  This will help prevent birth defects because when you do become pregnant, the additional folic acid is most helpful at the very time of conception, not just 10 weeks later when you might see a doctor about it.  It has also been shown to have other positive health benefits.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Gurleegirl,  Your risk of pregnancy is probably very low; however, it is not zero.  Depending on your cycle length you may have been at the beginning of your \"fertile time\" where sperm may be able to survive in the vaginal tract long enough to fertilize the released egg.  There may be small amounts of sperm in the pre-ejaculate fluid.  Overall, many things would need to line up just right for pregnancy to occur in this situation but, rarely, it may happen.  If your next period is not on time you can take a home urine pregnancy test.  These are typically very reliable beginning one week after the missed period.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Birth control pills are quite reliable (though not perfect) if taken faithfully.    You could be experiencing period abnormalities due to some kind of emotional problem or stress.  It is impossible to say exactly.  But, everything so far that you have shared lead me to believe you are not pregnant.    Good luck\n\n",

Your symptoms certainly could indicate pregnancy and cramping can occur even without causing problems, even though it sometimes heralds a miscarriage.  Unfortunately, if this is the case there is not much you can do to prevent it from happening.  It can go either way.  Your doctor would probably advise you to take it easy and no strenuous exercise or activity.  You probably just need to wait it out and be patient at this point.  Good luck for your success.\n\n",

I don't believe you should try to determine pregnancy or absence of it by temperature changes; just fertility which improves the likelihood of pregnancy occurring.  It is an aid to facilitate timeliness of sexual intercourse but not an indicator of actual conception.  Presence of rising levels of pregnancy hormones (hCG) detectable in pregnancy testing, and symptoms such as breast tenderness, absence of period, nausea, etc. are the best indicators that pregnancy has occurred.  Good luck.\n\n",

But when i started taking the red pills (from the new pack) i had a little bit (very little) bleeding through the day, very little.  Then today (the second day) i am having more red blood then yesterday, still very very light.  What do i do?  Continue taking the pills?  Stop the pills?

There are actually some oral contraceptives that delay the period for three months at a time (or even more) by doing basically what you have done here.  Normally you would not expect to have even a light period, but each person is unique and hormones can do funny things to you.  I wouldn't worry.\n\n",

    "content": "Besides stress, the most common reason is simple hormonal fluctuation.  The body is not a constant and unvarying machine putting out chemicals at exactly the same rate and amount every minute of every day.  It is the rare exception when a woman is absolutely constant to the day in her cycle - lucky because it is easier to plan - but most people vary at times.  Also there are other glands that regulate and if the \"master glands\" are \"off\" a bit, it can affect all kinds of bodily functions.  Usually things reverse themselves as the body attempts to remain in homeostasis.  This is why we don't usually panic with single variations to what is \"normal\" for us.  But, if it persists, it warrants having a doctor check things out.\n\n",

It typically takes a few months.  In healthy young women who have sexual intercourse regularly, most will become pregnant within a year so anything less than that would not be considered infertility.    Marijuana can affect fertility adversely so I would advise you to stop.    If nothing happens within the year,  you may want to see a urologist or ferility dpecialist.\n\n",

    "content": "Marijuana causes obstruction in sperm mobility and can reduce the sperm count so, yes, this could be contributing to your problem, though it may not be the only thing affecting your efforts. It also decreases the volume of seminal fluid. According to some researchers, Marijuana can cause changes in the process of hyper activation of sperm. The sperm of Marijuana smokers moves too fast at the early stage and may burn out before the process of fertilization, thus causing temporary infertility. These effects are not permanent and can be reversed within 30 days of stopping Marijuana's use.  I know of no reason the masturbation would be causing this problem but some doctors advise waiting a day between efforts at sexual intercourse in someone who is trying to become pregnant.  This seems to be helpful for the adequate sperm count.  In this way, masturbation could contribute negatively, depending on how frequently you do it.    It also seems like a bit of a waste when you are attempting pregnancy.  Use all the sperm when trying to conceive rather than wasting it.  This alone should improve your odds..\n\n",

I was tested for possible medical problems before puberty started, and all results were negative. I beleive the likely causes were genetic (my father was also a \"late bloomer\") and I was extremely active in sports until about age 14-15.    I've read countless article about decreased fertility and increased risk of birth defects after the age of 35.  I am wondering if my delayed puberty will have some effect on fertility?  Specifically I'm wondering if the delayed puberty will extend my \"safe\" fertility years past that for the average woman (age 35)?  Thank you for you help!\n\n",

    "content": "I would not expect your delayed puberty to affect your pregnancy possibility or outcome at this point.  All the eggs you will ever have are present at birth so your delayed puberty does not mean younger eggs.  While there is an increased risk of some problems in pregnancies of women over age 35, it is not actually a magic year where suddenly things \"break\" but is rather a gradual decline in fertility and aging eggs which occur over time.   Down Syndrome is probably the most significant abnormality that occurs more frequently with advanced maternal age but by total numbers, more young women deliver babies with Down Syndrome than older ones - mostly because they are having more babies generally.    Plenty of women are achieving healthy pregnancies with normal newborns into their forties.  Fertility is reduced however so you may have more difficulty achieving pregnancy at this age.  Your doctor may wish to monitor you more closely for high blood pressure psychological stress, preterm labor, etc.    When the desire for pregnancy occurs with quite advanced maternal age, egg donations are often used with in vitro fertilization in order to avoid her own aging eggs, which are more commonly associated with problems.    But, pregnancy can be achieved and normal babies born even without intervention.  If you become pregnant naturally, there are screenings that can be done in pregnancy to determine likelihood of a serious birth defect.  Keep in mind though, that these screenings are just that and not diagnostic.  They just show a greater or lesser likelihood of some problems.   Additional testing can make the definitive determination.    Let us know if you have other questions.\n\n",

    "content": "I couldn't venture a guess about what the doctor meant by \"suspicious\" unless it is a urine culture that might still grow something out even though it didn't show up initially on the urinalysis.  It is best to culture in this situation.  Lab errors or sample problems can also skew results so perhaps the doctor is being vigilant about this.    There is always the possibility of simple menstrual irregularity.  Even though some people can set their calendars by their regular periods, there are almost always exceptions at times.  Even your mental state can alter your period.  It's good that the doctor is evaluating further.  There is even the possibility of pregnancy that does not show up on a pregnancy test, though this is unusual.  You could be dealing with completely unrelated health concerns here.  So, the complete evaluation with your doctor is the best route.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your inquiry.  I'm sure this is a frustrating problem for both of you.  A gynecologist would be the doctor to consult about birth control options.  There are other methods out there and I doubt the absent periods are related to the breakthrough pregnancies.  Is there a chance she has missed pills at times during the cycle?  This would be the most likely cause for failure.  The NuvaRing or the birth control patch would both be methods that would not be affected by forgetfulness that often happens with the pill.  Hormone injections are another option.  Since these are hormonal, if there is a problem with your wife handling this type of contraception, it could theoretically be a problem with these as well.    Once you have completed your family and feel confident about that, sterilization is an excellent option.  But, be absolutely sure you are ready for a permanent method before undertaking this because you cannot be certain an expensive and painful reversal will be successful.\n\n",

    "content": "It could have a bearing.  If your sperm count happens to be low, it is usually recommended by fertility specialists that you wait a day between sexual intercourse for optimal success.  They often recommend every other day sexual relations with your wife.  If sperm count is good, daily would be OK, but Masturbation would be of no benefit anyway so if you can stop, that might help.  Also, it can normally take up to about a year of trying for pregnancy to be achieved so be patient.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm 40/F. Been married for 5 years, misscarried on my 8th week 1st year of marriage & still trying to conceive. Started to visit fertility clinic a year ago & did all the necessary test. My left tube is blocked. My hubby's sperm count was excellent. I've been injecting puregon since April (dose:50iu increased to 250iu). I had 2 iui both failed. Last month my FSH level was 11 & last 2 days I was on 300iu puregon but my eggs did not respond. Only 1 tiny little egg 4mm (if I'm wrong) on my day11. My dr. decided to abandon this cycle since my egg is not responding eventhough I was on maximum dose of puregon 300iu. Dr. said that my egg reserve is low & nothing can be done about it. Does that mean I can't have my own little angels? Am I nearing menopause? Is there any vitamins or supplements that I can take to decrease my FSH level & increase my chances to get pregnant? Please help....  Dimple\n\n",

    "content": "You may want to consider in vitro (IVF) using donor eggs.  Even though many women now successfully carry healthy babies to term after age 40, many of those you hear about have used donor eggs to optimize their chances.  Of course you won't read about this in People Magazine, and that's OK because it is a personal matter, not really public concern.  If you go this route, the same applies to you - nobody would need to know you used donor eggs and you would hopefully be able to carry the baby yourself anyway.  Many mothers feel this gives both parents a biological factor.  Your husband's sperm fertilizes the egg; you nourish and care for it in your body and you deliver as a couple just like anyone else.    I wish you success in your endeavor, but don't rule out alternative but rewarding ways to love and nurture a child.  Good luck.\n\n",

Typically a fertile, sexually active woman in your age range would expect to be pregnant within about a year of actively trying but it could certainly take a little longer without raising red flags.  If you were on hormonal contraceptives, that can delay fertility a bit.  At any rate I would expect you to become pregnant fairly soon.  If not, you may wish to visit your gynecologist for evaluation.  Good luck.\n\n",

It wasn't period b/c I just had one 2 weeks priore, and the smell very the blood smell, not a normal period.

My question is this, keep in mind I'm probably being paranoid... Today is July 9th, and the partner is about two weeks late on her period. Keep in mind she has shown no signs of being pregnant during the month of june. I'm really nervous that she could be pregnant from that incident with the condom. Should I be worried?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,      I am a 20 year old female who has recently been having some pain in what seemed to be my ovaries. I Also did not have my period for 4 months lasting from the beginning of march until the beginning of July. (I read up on this and realized it could be that I still was not ovulating it was just my uterus lining shedding since it was so thick) I finally went into the doctor's and have since had a external/internal ultrasound as well as several blood tests. My ultra sound showed that I have fiber cysts covering both ovaries, and since I have had recent wieght gain, some mild facial hair, infrequent/absent periods,  and pain all signs were pointing to PCOS said my Doctor. Well we checked all sorts of things including my insulin and the only thing that has come back irregular is my FSH level was low. And of course she said that it is possible to still have PCOS but unlikely since my insulin was normal. She also mentioned that since I have a cyst in the center of my brain that has been watched/evaluated yearly and has never shown any signs of problems it could possibly be linked with this low FSH level and what it is sending to my ovaries, again unlikely but still a possible route. Me and my husband are wanting to possibly start trying to have children especially if we are going to have problems concieving- and I would just like to know if anyone has any other suggestions as to what this possibly could be based on my symptoms or any advice as to what my next step should be? The only thing I have genetically is breast cancer on my dad's side and my aunt on my mother's side had endometriousis when she was 30. No medications and on surgery on a pilonidal cyst a year and a half ago.  Any suggestions are appreciated... please help. :)\n\n",

    "content": "I believe this could be PCOS, even without insulin problems.  People are very different in their response and you certainly have enough symptoms for me to suspect this.  Rarely does one present with all the possible symptoms in any given condition.  More commonly it is enough symptoms to raise red flags for further investigation.  There are medications, such as Metformin, that are effective in treating PCOS so I would see a doctor who is comfortable and experienced in treating PCOS (most likely OB/GYN or endocrinologist) to get another opinion about this.  I am guessing the cyst you refer to is on the pituitary gland.  It certainly can explain some of the FSH fluctuation.   PCOS can affect fertility so it is something to consider.  At your age, if you are actively trying to conceive, it will likely happen within the year.  If you do not become pregnant, that again might be a symptom of PCOS.    At any rate, getting an evaluation with a specialist could only help.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, my name is Jessica, and I am 21 years old. I have a 3 year old daughter  I got married february 2007 and are trying for a baby. I live in South  Africa.   I had my \"loop\" removed april 2007. My doctor told me that I would have no  problem to get pregnant.   I ovulated the 24th May and that night we tried to conceive and the night  after that. 2 days later, I have found myself with a bladder infection. So  bad, that there was blood in my urine. I went to my doctor, after telling  him that i ovulated 2 days before, and tried fot a baby, he gave me  antibiotics, called: Biocip 500. I drank 4 in 2 days. I was very  uncomfortable drinking antibiotics, knowing that I possibly may be pragnant.  So, I stopped the pills.   2 weeks later, My breasts were swollen, thick blue veins were showing on my  breasts, I was constipated, light-headed, congestion, ect. All the symtoms I  had when I was pregnant with my daughter. even the morning sickness.   We did 2 home pregnancy tests, both of them were positve.   went to the doc again, did a blood test. Doctor told me that if the blood  test says   0-3 it's negative  5+ is positive.   Later that day my doctor phoned me, saying that my test shows a 4. He cant  tell wether i am pregnant or not. After a 7 days(skipped my period for a  week), i went for another blood test.   This one was a 6.   But then the doctor told me that the 6 is just as good as a 4. So, doctor  told me that I am not pregnant.   On the 16th June I started my periods, which was supposed to start 8th June.  and lasted only 3 days, very light, no pain. Very weird, 'coz my period is  usually 5-6 days, and almost killing me!!!   I would like to know what's going on with my body, and why only that one  time when trying for a baby, i missed my period for a week??? Does that  mean that I could possibly be pregnant and had a miscarriage?\n\n",

Unfortunately, given your blood test that did not show a significant increase in the level of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCg), a hormone made by the placenta of the baby) and your onset of menses it is probable that you had a loss of your pregnancy.    This is quite common in the early stages of pregnancy.  Many occur before the pregnancy is ever detected and the woman never knows.    It should not necessarily affect future chances of pregnancy.  There is a very small (very small) chance the pregnancy is continuing so if you continue to have pregnancy symptoms you should follow up with your obstetrician.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The suppression of ovulation is the way it works and this lasts throughout the month, unless you miss pills - in that case you should use a back up until the next cycle.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 28 yr. old male. I was wondering if anyone had an idea as to what a \"normal\" semen analysis should read. Everything on mine seems normal (via website surfing) with the exception of morphology and motility. Morphlogy reads 84% abnormal and 14% normal, and motility is grade 2-3. I only have my student health insurance so I am only able to use the health center ay my university which does not staff specialists, therefore I am not 100% sure what this fancy-talk means.

    "content": "This type of evaluation can help determine fertility but are not actually diagnostic for infertility.  It helps the doctor determine what measures might be helpful if you desire to father a child but may be having difficulty achieving this.  I am not an expert here, but I am seeing some variation in what is considered \"normal.\"  In addition to this, there are different methods for evaluating morphology and motility and labs do vary so it is hard to give information with numbers alone.    With morphology, according to the New England Journal of Medicine, anything greater then 12% normal is in the fertile range.  Based on this information you are sill in normal range here at 14%  However, another site I found gives 50% as fertility minimum.  This alone tells me that surfing the net for evaluation of your labs will probably not be helpful.  I assume you have seen a urologist or fertility specialist who could better interpret the results and what they mean to you, based on the ranges given at the lab where the work was done. This is probably the only way to correctly interpret and understand your situation.  I'm sorry I am not more helpful here and perhaps someone else here will be able to add to it.\n\n",

Being that she had her period last week,and semen can stay in the body for up to 5 days, it is possible that she could get pregnant. But as I said, the chance of that happening when you did not ejaculate inside her is small.  You just need to wait until her next expected period. Take a home pregnancy test if she does not get her period on time. If the test is negative, wait a week and retest. If her period still has not arrived, then she should see a doctor for a pregnancy test, or to determie the cause of her late period.\n\n",

    "content": "Clomid has been used frequently for women who are unable to conceive and for many it is seen as a miracle drug.  It has been suggested that it in some cases it may be prescribed too readily, without the proper workup.    Because of the risk of having multiples, clomid should only be used under the right conditions and with your doctor's advice.  Having multiples might seem like fun but in reality it is a major cause of prematurity, which is the leading cause of newborn morbidity and mortality.  Premature babies are very expensive, requiring sometimes months-long stays in newborn ICU.  Often they have serious health problems, developmental delays, etc. that require lifelong treatment.  While many babies do fine, many others do not and of course the earlier they are, the more dire the outlook.    Because of these and other reasons, you should not be too casual about the use of fertility drugs such as clomid.  But, I do recommend you talk with your gynecologist about your concerns.  If you are actively trying to become pregnant with regular sexual activity it would be likely that you would become pregnant within a year without any intervention, but if not, your doctor could work you up for the appropriate course of action, which may have nothing to do with your ovulatory cycle.  For instance, if your husband has a low sperm count or motility, it wouldn't matter that you were releasing more than one egg at a time.  The treatment in this case would be very different.  Good luck in your efforts.\n\n",

    "title": "Stress? pregnant? something else?",
    "content": "Hello, thank you for reading, some replies would really help me clear my head. I'm 21 years old. My period is decently regular, every so often being off a few days. I am however slightly underweight, often stressed, and prescribed xanax for anxiety, (I have heard certain drugs such as different antidepressants can cause a late of missed period, and I didn't know if Xanax can do this or not). I have had sex twice in the last four months, both times a condom was used--to the best of my knowledge--very carefully. The condoms used were lubricated with spermicide.  Last month my period was between five days to a week late, but I chalked it up to stress as I was under very high stress at that time, (it may also be important to note that as soon as the main source of stress was removed, my period began, although with very few symptoms to announce it's arrival and very dark in color for the first few days). If my period went back to 'normal', it should begin in a couple of days, however I am concerned because I am showing little to no signs that it is coming., which is unusual, since I used to show many signs that it was approaching. I am wondering, how great is the risk of being pregnant? And otherwise, what else could be the causes for this? Could stress from last month, or last month's period being off still be affecting me in this month? Thank you in advance for any replies.\n\n",

    "content": "Stress can definitely affect your periods and it is considered a fairly common cause of such trouble.   Xanax has also been reported to have this side effect.  Hormones can also get out of balance and it sometimes takes a few months to self-correct.   Used correctly, as you have stated, condoms are very effective as contraceptives with only about a 2% failure rate,(and they help prevent sexually transmitted infections).  Of course, abstinence is the only 100% effective contraception, so there is always the possibility of pregnancy if you are fertile and having sexual intercourse.    A pregnancy test is the best way to find out and you should be able to tell at 5 weeks following your last regular period.  A blood test can verify even earlier.  I hope this helps.\n\n",

I am worried that this might be implantation bleeding. I took a home pregnancy test today (a First Response Early Result) and it was negative, however I am concerned that I may have tested too early.  Could this be implantation bleeding? Is it more likely that it is implantation bleeding or my period pending to begin? I had cramps and ovarian pain during the last  few days, but today haven't noticed any. I am probably going to try to go see a doctor to get a blood test preformed this week if my period doesn't start soon.  Should a blood test be accurate by now?

Spotting that occurs around a week after ovulation is likely implantation bleeding.  While there are exceptions, spotting very close to the time that your period would normally start may likely be the beginning of your period.    You can test for pregnancy as early as ten days after ovulation with a blood test.  Five weeks after your last period began would be the time for a home pregnancy (urine) test.  Cramping can be present in either early pregnancy or with a period so that doesn't really help you to know.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "If you had your period pregnancy is unlikely; however, if there is any concern I recommend you take a pregnancy test during the 5th week after your last period (or the one before in this case).  I suspect that what may be happening is that the hormone level that you have in your pills is a bit low for you-in particular the progesterone part.  Menstruation is induced by the withdrawal of progesterone.  Typically this occurs during the week of non-hormonal pills.  If the progesterone level is too low for your particular body it may sense the pregesterone level dropping sooner than it should and your period will start early.  If this is a recurring problem you may want to talk with your gynecologist about changing to a pill with slightly more progesterone in it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "It is difficult to say for certain as each woman's body is different.  However, lack of cervical mucous may pose a difficulty with conception.  The cervical mucous provides a liquid medium for the sperm to travel through to the egg.  There are many factors that can lead to lack of cervical mucous.  Low estrogen levels may cause low cervical mucous supply.  Being very thin can decrease estrogen levels.  As a women gets older, she naturally begins to make less cervical mucous.  Many medications can decrease mucous production as well.  I would recommend that you consider seeing a Reproductive endocrinologist (an obstetrician specializing in fertility) if you are unable to conceive after one year of trying or if you have reasons to believe that you cannot conceive.  Staying very well hydrated will help increase mucous production as well.  Avoid antihistamines or other medications that can decrease production.  Your gynecologist should be able to tell you if any of your medicines can have this side effect.  Best wishes in your attempts to conceive.  Let us know if we can be of any other help to you with information.\n\n",

Sperm can live in the female genital tract for several days.  Viable sperm have been reported after a week in some cases.  Pre-ejaculate does not contain much sperm but can contain some.  Amoxicillin theoretically can reduce the effectiveness of birth control pills.  To my knowledge there is still some debate about this.  However, given the possibility it is always safest to use a second method of contraception while the woman is using amoxicillin if pregnancy is not desired.  Overall, I think the risk of pregnancy in your situation is low but is definitely not zero.  If your girlfriend does not start her period on time I would recommend she take a home pregnancy test some time during the fifth week after her last period started.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm not asking about me(I'm a guy)  A friend of mine started on the Birth Control Pill in February. She is a 20 year old female. She can't remember getting her period this month and is scared about it. She and her boyfriend don't have sex yet, they do other stuff though. She was wondering if when someone starts taking the Birth Control Pill, they ever(for some wierd reason) miss a period without being pregnant.  Also, a slightly related question: how long does sperm live outside of the body without being in someone else's?   Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Occasionally it can take a few cycles for the birth control pills to truly regularize a woman's cycle.  Most commonly, the first cycle on the pills will be the one that is different.  If there is any possibility of pregnancy I would suggest she take a pregnancy test to be sure.  Also, if she does not have a period with her next set of placebo pills she should talk with her gynecologist.  Regarding your second question, sperm typically will only survive for about an hour or two outside the body.  If semen is still wet, it could possibly still contain living sperm but not for too long.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi all  I am currently on Evorel HRT Patches, i am 23 years old and have been on HRT for the past few years.  When i am on these patches from day 15 to 32(i think) i have to take norethisterone tablets to make me have my monthly. This month i have had alot on and have forgotten to tak emy pills as i am so far into taking my HRT i have decided not to take them until next month, however as i am aware you are not supposed to have any sign of a period unless you take norethisterone.  The point i am trying to make is that since saturday i have experienced light brown spotting nearly everyday but about a week before that my breasts especially my nipples have been really sore, then on saturday i had the worst stomach ache ever during the night. Now as it is tuesday i am still experiencing light brown spotting and have now developed nausea, not sure if it is just me or the hormones playing up. My pregnancy rating is like 2% chance and i am worried as to what is causing this spotting. I do have an appointment at my doctors on friday but i am slightly worried as she may shout at me for not taking the norethisterone, any ideas may help  Thank you   Stephyg XXx\n\n",

    "content": "It is likely that you are simply experiencing some breakthrough bleeding.  Often HRT doses of estrogen are relatively low.  Your body can still make progesterone and may be inducing some spotting.  This can happen with oral contraceptive pills also because some women need higher doses of estrogen during parts of their cycle to keep spotting from occuring.  For these women, the triphasic pills often resolve the issue.  In your case, it is likely that you've not experienced this because you normally take the norethisterone to induce your menses at about the time that you would normally be having the spotting if you did not take the norethisterone.  This does not, however, mean that this will happen every time that you push back taking the norethisterone.  It is not dangerous to not take the norethisterone on schedule every once in a while.  In fact, there are oral contraceptives now available that only have a menstrual period every three months.  I'm not sure why you are on HRT.  If you are also wanting birth control oral contraceptive pills will do the same as the HRT for you and will likely eliminate the side effect you are experiencing.  This may be something you want to talk with your gynecologist about.  If there a chance you may be pregnant I would recommend you be tested for this.  Home pregnancy tests are generally reliable in the 5th week after the start of your previous period.  Best wishes.\n\n",

After I got back from spring break, where I had an awful sleeping pattern and ate differently than usual, I got my period, which was a week and a half earlier than usual.  It was heavy at first, pretty steady for 3 days, then it was mostly brown-spotting.  I have never even had sex, but my boyfriend and I were fooling around and I didn't have underwear on, and was scared that there may have been pre-ejaculation.  Is there any way I am pregnant?

    "content": "The chances that you are pregnant are very, very small.  More likely, the changes in your sleep pattern, activity level and stresses caused your cycle to readjust.  This is very common.  After the stressors resolve, the cycle usually readjusts and becomes regular again.  There is little sperm in \"preejaculate\" and without intercourse it would be difficult for the sperm to successfully reach the egg for fertilization.  Also, given that you had your period this is a strong indicator of non-pregnancy.  Pregnancy would generally suppress menses.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Micheller,  Women under the age of 40 who have a tubal reversal through the traditional surgical methods have a 70% to 80% pregnancy success rate, with conception usually occurring during the first year after the procedure. Women who have microsurgery done have a slightly higher success rate, with about 90% of women becoming pregnant within one year of the procedure.  I am not sure which method was performed in your case.  Although pregnancy rates after a tubal reversal are significantly better than trying to conceive through IVF, having the procedure done does not guarantee that you will become pregnant.   If prengnancy does not occur naturally within the next 12 months, speak to your physcian about going on a fertility treatment program to help facilitate your ovulation and improve your chances of conception. (without the use of IVF).  If pregnancy does not occur by the above method, them your last option would be to consider IVF.  Good Luck and keep me updated\n\n",

I also have been doing Ovulation Predictor Kits for 6 month ( I do 25 day kits) and they have consistantly been negative.  So, I guess I am just wondering if I'm really ovulating or not.

If the kit i showing this sign and your periods are a normal cycle, Then I would agree with your doctor that you are ovulating.  There are some medications that you should discuss with your doctor to help aid in your ovulation (production & release of eggs), one is being Clomid that helps your body release eggs for fertilization. But before this method is used it would be imperative that your spouse seek out an urologist to get a sperm test to make sure there is an adeqaute number to aid in fertilization. Just remember the aid of medications such as Clomid can enable a woman to release numerouse eggs resulting in multiple births.  Good Luck, and Thank You for using Doctors Lounge,\n\n",

I have never skipped a period and im really worried that i could be pregnant again. I usually cant smell very well but now i can smell very very well (I can smell the flowers 2 feet away from them and i couldnt even smell them while standing next to them befor) I was very nausious for about a week and vommited a few times.

There is no such thing as (Pre-Cum) or the ability to just wipe it off in order to prevent pregnancy.  The only guarentee to prevent pregnancy is  absenence. Even the use of a condom or birth control form only gives you 98% chance of not conceiving.  It takes a womans body after given birth about 1 year to get back to normal in having a regular and consistant menstrual cycle, this only applies if you are not breastfeeding.  If you have not started your period within the next 7 days, consult your physcian to have a blood test performed.  Good Luck  Dr. Anderson\n\n",

As for the irregular menstruation, you might be having something called polycystic ovaries..that can be diagnosed by ultrasound as well and that doesnot mean that you won't get pregnant...you just need to be put on the right dierction...both you and your partner.

    "content": "Hello there,  3 years ago I had my 4th baby and had my tubes tied, not sure of the technical name, now we may be interested in having another baby.  At the time, it was the right decision for us, but now we would like to possibly have another baby. I am 32 years old and have got pregnant very easy and had good pregnancies with the ones that worked out and delivered perfectly quick.   I had my tubes done twice due to getting pregnant with a tubal pregnancy a couple months after my first tubal tie surgery.  So, back in again, took a larger piece out and cuterized both ends I believe.  I assume in vetro would be our best option.  My husband and I had no trouble concieving, usually first month we tried every time.  Although, I had 3 tubal pregnacies and a couple other odd pregnancy losses.  Total of 9 pregnancies all together.  Anyway, we seem very very fertile other than the tubal problem now.  Would it be fairly easy for two very fertile people to conceive with in vetro on the first try or does that not  pretain to how fertile we are.  I am new to this way of pregnancy and my doctor's will probably think I'm nuts getting pregnant again and going through this trouble for #5 baby.  Also, wondered who northpointe ob deals with as far as a fertility clinic, they are my primary doctor's, but before I embarress myself by telling them we may want another baby, thought I would get more information and see if we really want to persue this route.  Any ideas how much in vetro cost would be also?  Thanks for any advice or answers to some of my questions.\n\n",

    "content": "I suspect, given your descriptions, that you should have no trouble with embryo implantation and carrying a baby to full term if you were to successfully become pregnant using IVF.  That being said, IVF success rates are somewhat independent of the couple in that there are many steps that are difficult simply by technological means.  Your chances of success are likely to be the same as the general chances of success with IVF.  Success rates are generally quoted at about 20-30% for each attempt.  (Some clinics are reporting higher rates now, but none are above 40-50% to my knowledge.)    Costs are reported to be around 10-15,000 US dollars per cycle (attempt).  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Medinaz,  According to papers and researches, pregnancy rate following vasectomy ranges between 25-50% and that is because the sperms were trapped in the testis for such a long time, they become weak and their motion even becomes slower.  Sperms can be present in the semen either right away or it might take a couple of weeks...but for you to get pregnant you should give yourself a chance of 1 year before trying ECSI (extracorporeal sperm injection) where doctors get your ova and his sperm and inject it and them put it back into your uterus.  Be patient and  best of luck,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Premature ejaculation (PE) is the commonest sexual dysfunction in males younger than 40 years.    The sexual response in divided into 3 phases: desire, excitement, and orgasm.  Premature ejaculation is considered a psychological disorder and not an organic problem. Anxiety for performance or any other deep psychological problems are involved.  Most professionals diagnose premature ejaculation if ejaculation occurs before reaching sexual satisfaction for both partners regardless the time it takes to finish.  No lab tests or investigations are required in most of the cases. Checking a serum testosterone (free and total) level and prolactin level may be appropriate if premature ejaculation is observed in conjunction with an impotence problem.  Premature ejaculation does not interfere with conception unless it occurs before man's penis is inside the woman's vagina.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Increase in the amount of vaginal discharge, an abnormal odor or consistency of the fluid, presence of pain, itching, or burning are all signs of possible infection in the vagina (vagainitis).

Candidiasis or vaginal yeast infection causes (thick, white, cottage cheese-like, non-odorous discharge, may be also associated with itching.  Identification of yeast under a microscope is the most accurate way to establish the diagnosis.  Other causes for vaginal discharge due to bacterial of protozoal infections ( including STDS) should be excluded. Direct clinical examination is essential.   Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The intra-uterine contraceptive device (IUCD) \u2013 or coil \u2013 is a small plastic or copper device used to prevent fertilization. IUD can be left for up to ten years as long as there is regular follow up and no local problems occur.   The fear of getting and spread of infection through the IUD although small is highly considered. Most of doctors check  for any possible existing infection before they fit an IUD. The risk of spread of infection into the uterus and the fallopian tubes causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) which result in infertility is of utmost concern. For this reason, doctors advise women to be on regular follow up and to report them with any symptoms suggestive of infection like pelvic pain or any abnormal vaginal discharge for prompt management.  Clomid and other hormonal approaches are given when there is ovulation defect that is confirmed by many investigations including the hormonal profile.  In you case I advise you to follow with your doctor and to start investigations to exclude any possibility of tubal block or uterine cause rather than a hormonal treatment since you are ovulating normally and have no menstrual irregulatory, so it is more logic to check for local problems.\n\n",

It's been almost 3 weeks since then and I've been feeling a lot of nausea lately and I havn't really eaten along with back pain and some constipation. I was just wondering could I be pregnant? I really wasn't concerned about it until these symptoms came and I also think isn't it a little to early to be having these symptoms due to pregnancy ie) back pain and constipation already? I was thinking maybe I was just stressing out or maybe caught a little twinge of the flu. Also; isnt rare to get pregnant through clothing just from pre-ejaculate. Anyways thankyou for your help I just need to put my mind at ease because I already have one daughter and I'm really not in the place for any more kids right now.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is very unlikely to get pregnant from the pre-ejaculate secretions (contain secretions that facilitate sperm passage and act as lubricants) although they may contain sperms, but it could happen.  However, the symptoms you have mentioned are not specific for pregnancy and could be of many other causes like GI problems.  If you have any delay of your period and you have some doubts about your symptoms you can do a pregnancy test.  A Pregnancy test is a test that examine for a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) that is positive when women are pregnant. The test can be done using blood or urine sample.   However, a blood test can tell if the woman is pregnant or not in term of few days (6-8 days) from ovulation and fertilization, this means beofre even a missed period. The test can give a clear answer for pregnancy (yes to be pregnant or not) , as well as an idea about the pregnancy duration in weeks by a quantitative analysis.   Testing for urine on the other hand, is better done one week after a missed period. One negative result (especially soon after a missed period) is not enough to exclude pregnancy and the test should be repeated there after or blood test is done. Some Antibiotics and contraceptive pills interfere with the test and should be avoided.   So, a negative blood test for B-HCG means non preganant, while a negative urine test needs either to be repeated or to be confirmed by a blood test.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  A pregnancy test is a test that examine for a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) that is positive when women are pregnant. The test can be done using blood or urine sample.  However, a blood test can tell if the woman is pregnant or not in term of few days (6-8 days) from ovulation and fertilization, this means beofre even a missed period. The test can give a clear answer for pregnancy (yes to be pregnant or not) , as well as an idea about the pregnancy duration in weeks by a quantitative analysis.  Testing for urine on the other hand, is better done one week after a missed period. One negative result (especially soon after a missed period) is not enough to exclude pregnancy and the test should be repeated there after or blood test is done. Some antibiotics and contraceptive pills interfere with the test and should be avoided.  So, a negative blood test for B-HCG means non preganant, while a negative urine test needs either to be repeated or to be confirmed by a blood test.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  A hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is an X-ray test used to examine for the uterus and the  fallopian tubes in women who has fertility problems.   Basically a dye (contrast material) is injected through the vagina into the uterus and normally it will flow into the fallopian tubes to the abdominal cavity with no leak outside the uterus (minimal leak is accepted).  It also help to delineate the anatomical shape of the uterus and the tubes to check for any abnormalities or adhesion.  Some doctors believe that the procedure it self can help to cut some the adhesion that block the tubes, although most of doctors give a lot of concern and precautions for possible increase in the incidence of ascending infections or inflammatory damage of the tubes.  It is definitely a good sign that the dye did not leak out of the uterus, however only your doctor who did the test and saw the X-ray can give you a better conclusion\n\n",

Cause of PCOS are not known yet. Females with PCOS experience any of the following symptoms: menstrual irregularity or absence of menstruation,  irregular vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain  fertility problems increased growth of hair  acne, oily skin, or dandruff  obesity type 2 diabetes  high cholesterol  high blood pressure  Most women with PCO do not need medications to become pregnant, even in the presence of some menstrual irregularities.    Medications for those who fail to get pregnant should be prescribed by specialists when indicated. Women who has PCO should be followed regularly by their doctors during pregnancy to control problems like elevated blood sugar and blood pressure.  Obesity per se does not cause fertility problems although it may increase complications during pregnancy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Pap smear is not routinely used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis being less sensitive, however it is an adequate diagnostic test when it is positive being highly specific.    Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) results from infections of the female genital tract that spread from the cervix to the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and the surrounding peritoneum.   PID results in many symptoms like: -         pain and tenderness in the lower abdomen, -         vaginal discharge with bad smell, -         pain during sex etc  The risk for PID increases in cases of sexual contact with multiple partners as well as unsafe sexual habits.   Physical examination and investigations are the only way to reach diagnosis. Starting antibiotic treatment immediately and for a period of two weeks is mandatory to prevent possible complications that include tubal damage.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Your inability to get pregnant is probably related to the cause of your amenorrhea.   If your periods are irregular or have stopped completely and your doctor can find no obvious cause, it may be that something has upset your natural hormone levels. Medroxyprogesterone (Provera) can help to restore your natural hormone levels, because it mimics the effects of your natural progesterone.  In other words Provera will get your menstrual cycles going but it won't treat the cause that stopped them in the first place.  I would suggest going back to your gyno on that one.\n\n",

Taking into consideration your other post in the Diabetes forum, in my opinion, I would be more inclined to consider that your menstrual irregularities may be related to insulin resistance as seen in PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) rather than being specifically related to one Depo-Provera injection. Again, I would encourage you to have an evaluation by an Endocrinologist. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi wallsy, This syndrome is not easily diagnosed. A diagnosis of PCOS is typically based on several factors, ie, symptoms identified by physical exam, diagnostics (labwork, ultrasound), etc. There isn't one specific test used for identification. The only explanation I could think of for the lack of evaluation during your previous hospital stay is due to the fact that you were admitted specifically for Diabetic Ketoacidosis and their focus was to achieve control of that particular crisis. However, in my opinion, taking into consideration the frequency of your hospital admissions, referral to an Endocrinologist should have already been suggested and arranged. Below is a link for some information regarding PCOS, and again, I would encourage you to have an evaluation by an Endocrinologist. Click here! Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "She probably meant the symptoms you had were from the acid reflux, not the late period.   It is not uncommon for women to sometimes skip ovualtion for a month. That would cause you to not have a period this month.  Have you recently started dieting or exercising? Over exercising or cutting to many calories can cause your period to be absent.  Stress can also cause a late or absent period. The medical term for an absent period is called amenorrhea.  Since your period is now 3 weeks late, your next period should be due in about a week or so, I would wait and see if it comes or not. If it does not come, you should make another appointment with the doctor to find the cause.\n\n",

If you are trying to concieve and your periods are irregular, then usually a doctor will prescribe birth control pills for a short time to try to regulate the menstral cycle.  Periods can be irregular for a number of different reasons, I suggest that you make an apppointment with your gynecologist and tell him your concerns so that you can begin to try to regulate your periods.\n\n",

It said in the pamplet to use condoms for the first seven days of the pill just in case and then after the first seven days it was safe. The woman at the clinic told me to take 21 days beforer having sex without a condom but then iasked the clinic again and they said they just say to take 21 days because thats the general for all pills and because most teenage girls do not take their pills on time. But I have been taking my pills on time for 2 weeks now and it did say that its only necessary to use a condom for the first week. So is it safe for me to have sex without a condom when i have been taking them exactly on time for 2 weeks now and not have to wrry about pregnancy?\n\n",

If you look at it from the perspective that the timeframe is only an additional two weeks, and nothing is 100% positive in preventing pregnancy aside from abstinence, two more weeks really isn't that long of time.

    "content": "Trying to concieve with diabetes can be tricky. Also, you mentioned a weight loss, so are you now at a normal healthy weight, or are you still overweight?  Being overweight can cause a lot of problems with fertility by itself, and addded to that the complications of diabetes, that could be a major cause for your infertility. So first of all I would recommend that if you are still overweight, that you continue to eat healthy and get exercise to get to your goal weight.   Now to deal with the diabetes part.  First, make an appt with yoru doctor if you haven't already done so and tell him that you are trying to concieve. Your doctor needs to run tests to make sure yoru diabetes is under control enough for you to begin trying to concieve.  Have your urine checked for diabetic kidney complications. Check your cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  Blood glucose screening: Your doctor will check to see if your blood glucose is in control. Good blood sugar control is important before becoming pregnant because many women do not even know they are pregnant until the baby has been growing for 2-4 weeks. High blood glucose levels early in the pregnancy (before 13 weeks) can cause birth defects. In addition, good blood glucose control is just as important during pregnancy because high blood glucose levels can increase the risk of miscarriage and can increase your risk of developing diabetes complications. Make medication adjustments: If you take insulin to control your diabetes, your doctor can tell you how to adjust your medication. Generally your body will require more insulin during pregnancy, especially during the last 3 months of pregnancy. If you take oral medications to control your diabetes, your doctor may switch your medication to insulin during pregnancy, since certain oral medications could harm the developing baby. Meal planning: During pregnancy, you and your health care provider should work together to adjust your meal plan. Changing your meal plan will help you avoid problems with low and high blood glucose levels. Your meal plan will also be adjusted to include more calories for your growing baby. Before becoming pregnant, start taking a daily vitamin that contains folic acid. Folic acid has been shown to decrease the risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida -- a serious condition in which the brain and spinal cord do not form normally. The March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation recommends taking 400 micrograms of folic acid daily before conception and in early pregnancy. Many pharmacies sell over-the-counter prenatal vitamins that do not require a prescription  Good luck\n\n",

If pregnancy is definitely ruled out and your menstrual cycle does not return some of the factors that may cause Amenorrhea are stress, diet (malnutrition/anorexia), ovarian dysfunction, hormone disturbances, endocrine dysfunction, etc. An evaluation to determine the cause aside from pregnancy would be warranted.

    "content": "Age 36, Female.  Well-butrin 300mg XR daily for depression for three years now. Clomid from July05-Dec05. Metformin from Dec05 through current. I smoke approx 18 cigarettes a day. Other than smoking, I eat healthy, walk 30 minutes a day, four times a week and I am not overweight.  I've had irregular periods all of my life but never skipped a period (range of 24-39 days)- terrible cramps on the first day and half of second day menstruation except when I was on birth-control pills.   My mother also has very irregular periods and said that she conceived all three children with no rhyme or reason during her cycle, but she does not get cramps.  After two years of trying, I visited my Doc and my progesterone level was 8, well below the recommended 15.  They prescribed Clomid in July 2005 and my progesterone levels were good after taking Clomid (26).  My cervical mucus was barely present after several months on clomid and sex was sometimes painful because I was so dry. They prescribed estrogen to offset the vaginal dryness, but it did not help much.   After no luck with the Clomid, I had an ultra-sound in December to check for endometriosis and PCOS three days before my period was expected (have been regular on the Clomid- 28 days).  The ultra-sound showed 2 or 3 little cysts on one of my ovaries and my uterine lining was thick.  The doctor said that the cyst sizes were probably not indicative of PCOS and they looked like ovulation-sized cysts.  He prescribed Metformin just to be safe and ordered another ultra-sound for the following month.  After my period in early January of this year, I stopped taking Clomid.  The vaginal dryness and risk of forming cysts with extended use were my major reasons.  I am thinking of trying the Clomid again in a few months and hopefully, I won't experience the hostile mucus for the first two months.  My plan is to have sex right before and during my period, every other day during the month.  In January, I took another ultra-sound, approximately 13 days after my period and the cysts were gone, uterine lining was not thick.  My appt is next week to discuss the results with my doctor.  I am still taking the Metformin (for about 45 days now).  My husband and I have been trying to conceive for 30 months.  Believe it or not, we rarely (maybe once or twice) had sex right before my period.  We were typically having sex on days 8-18 and we would poop out after the 10 days, waiting for the next cycle.  Is it possible that I am ovulating 3 days before my period begins?  My doctor is an OB/GYN and has said that he is not a fertility specialist.  This whole experience has been very dis-heartening and I was hoping to get a second opinion.  Any suggestions on what I can do to improve fertility? Does it sound like endometriosis? Can you recommend any new medications that might help?  Thank you in advance for your advice.  Sorry for the length of this posting, but I wanted to give you the entire background.\n\n",

I am not a doctor or anything but i would like to suggest that you try Ovulex.  I have been trying to conceive for 13months now without any luck.  I am only 23 and didnt think i would have any problems. I really want to get Ovulex but my husband wants me to wait a little longer to see if we can conceive on our own.  He doesnt want me to take any drugs or anything.  Ovulex is not a drug, it is made from natural herbs.  I am soo stressed at the momment and trying to conceive is driving me crazy. My husband tells me to try not to stress but i cant help it. I can not imagine what you are going through, it must be very stressful for you.  Please pm me if you would like to chat.  thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "I will do a little research on Ovulex- thanks for the suggestion.  At this point, I am trying to be open-minded about every option.  I hope that things work out for you and your husband.  One thing that is definitely in your favor is time- you are very young and will probably get pregnant soon enough.  Couple of suggestions from my experiences in trying to get pregnant:  Buy an ovulator predictor kit from a drug store- should cost under $15 and it will give you and your husband a little notice about when to have sex.  Women can ovulate at different times in their cycle outside of the normal 14 days before your period- who knows?  Maybe you've been trying at the same time each month and missing your ovulation.  If you can, have sex every other day for the entire month (not every day because it depletes the man's sperm)- this way, you will not miss your ovulation time.  Best of luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "I am 22years old and have been trying to conceive with my husband for over a year.  I am not on any medication and have not been since I can remember.  There has been no history of infertility in my family.  I have been taking Blackmores folic acid tablets.  My friend is getting married this year and has been talking about having a baby for the last coupke of weeks. She is excited, however it breaks my heart to think that she might conceive straight away while I have been trying for soo long.  I get very emotional on and off and get depressed when I get my period.  The last week I have been very emotional and depressed and have been snapping at me husband for no reason.  Its even worse when he asks me if im serious when I tell him I got my period.  A baby is something we both cannot wait to have.  I am very jealous when I hear of people conceiving without trying/accidental pregnancies.  To make it worse I work with baby furniture and see pregnant mums and new borns everyday.  It breaks my heart to see so many pregnant mums everyday, I look at them and wish that was me.  My husband and I have been keeping this a secret all this time and I really cant handle the pressure.  I really want to try Ovulex as it is a natural fertility aid for women, though my husband wants me to wait a little longer to see if we can conceive on our own. He doesnt think there is anything wrong with it taking this long to conceive. He thinks we can do it on our own without any help, but I cant help but wonder how long it would take if we didnt get any help.  I am worried that I will never have a baby, something that I want more than anything else in this world.  Any advice would be soo very much appreciated. I am desperate at the moment with no one to talk to. Please help me.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Im very sorry your going through this, hopefulyl I can offer a little help.  First of all, stress can have a harsh effect on your periods, and the ability to concieve. The more you worry abotu becommign pregnantt, the harder it can become. Have you ever heard of a couple trying to concieve a child for years without sucess, so they decide to adopt, only to become pregnant right after? The stress of having a child is removed, and concieving happens naturally, often without trying.   So, my first suggestion is try not to let it stress you out to much. I know this is much easier said than done, but it is important.  Second, you should make an appointment with your doctor, tell him your trying to become pregnant, and want checked out to make sure everything is working ok. You did not mention if yoru periods were regular or not. You may want to get on birth control for a few months to regulate your periods if they are irregular, that will help with concieving.It also may be a good idea to have your husband checked out to make sure his sperm is in good shape, he may have a low count, or they may be bad swimmers. If everything checks out healthy, then try charting your cycles for a few months, so you know when you are most fertile and can plan sex accordingly.  Hopefully, knowing you are on the right tract will remove some of the stress, and you will become pregnant without to much effort or worry.\n\n",

    "content": "In 2004 my period from what i can remember was quite regular.  In Jan, Feb, March and April i got my period every 4th tuesday and think it used to be the same in 2004. We started trying in December 2004. In December 2004  my cycle was 28 days Jan was 28 days  Feb  was 28 days March  was 30 April was 30 May  was 27 June was 29 July was 33 August was 27 Sept was 28 October was 30 November was 29 December was 31 and last month was 32  May was the 1st time i didnt get my period on the tuesday, i got it on the thursday and i thought i was pregnant. I don't know why all of a sudden my period changed.  It didnt seem to matter how many days it went for it just always came on the 4th tuesday.   Can you help me with the days that i have given you?  I have used maby baby ovulation stick and i have a ovulation thermometre.  Last night my husband and i decided that we will try ovulex next month. But we wont order it until i get my next period.  Do you think this is a good idea? have you heard much about ovulex?? do you think i would be waisting my money??  Do you think it could have anything to do with us not having sex at the right times??? We normally have sex 12 to 15 days from my period and all throughout the month. When ever we can/ have energy. We have sex pretty much every second day if we don't have it everyday and the latest we wait is every 3rd day, which isnt much.  I am worried about going to the doctors, because i know people are very judgemental and i am worried that they will tell me not to worry because i am very young. Although my husband is 27 he is not so young to be a father. I am also scared that they will tell me that i wont be able to have babies, or my husband for that matter.  Please tell me what you think, thank you soo much Gracie01. I really do appreciate your help. are you a real nurse?? Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "There is a website called mymonthlycycles, you can put in all your menstration dates, and it will tell you when to expect your next period, and when you ovulate. Use this in conjunction with the ovulation sticks, and you should have a good idea of when you are oulating. When you know when you ovualte, you can start having sex on your fertile days. Have sex every other day during your fertile time, that way you have a fresh supply of sperm.  Don't worry about going to the doctor, tell him you have been trying for over a year, and want checked out to make sure everything is healthy, like I said, your husband may have low sperm count or something. If you get a doctor that is judgemental or tells you not to worry, just find another one who treats you right and takes you seriously.  I understand you are scared he may tell you you cannot have children, but it is important to discover what is wrong, if anything, so that you can correct the problem.  About ovulex, I havent heard anything about it, but I have read up on it, and it lenghtens your ovulation cycle, reduces stress, and balances your menstrual cycle to increases your chances of becomming pregnant. I havent been able to find any side effeects of taking it, however, I wonder about the safety of the baby if you were to become pregnant while taking ovulex.  I would highly recommend that you talk to a doctor first, and ask him about the safety of taking it before starting ovulex.   Good luck, any more questions, I would be happy to answer.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again,  When I said I wondered about the safety of Ovulex for the baby, I meant, if you concieved while using it, you would continue to take ovulex for a few weeks after concieving because you would not have known you concieved that time. Although it is all natural, some herbs can be harmful to the fetus.Companies promote all natural remedies, and people think because it says all natural that means it is completly safe, and that is not the case.Ovulex has ginsing in it, which is a stimulant, but I do not know if that can be harmful to a developing fetus or not. Personally, I am not a fan of taking any natural remedies without a doctors approval first to be sure of the safety of the drug, espicially in the case of a developing fetus. Also, Im not even sure how well this would actually work, if it would help at all  As far as Amberoz, it strenghtens sexual arousal, helps the body eliminate toxins and claims to strenghten the sperm. Im not sure how true either ovulex or amberoz would actually work, Im having a bit of trouble finding realible information about either of these. I don't think it would hurt to try amberoz, but, that would only work if the problem was your husbands sperm, and since you havent seen a doctor yet, he may or may not be the problem.   So, I still say the first order of business to  becomming pregnant is seeing a doctor to make sure both of you are healthy, PLEASE don't be scared to find out you are not able to have children, some couples just take longer than others, and if it is the case that one of you has a problem, it would be better to find this out now, and take the steps to fix the problem now.   As for you diet, it would be benificial to begin eating healthy now, because you will need a healthy body to grow a healthy baby, once you are pregnant you will need to start eating healthy. It would be a good idea to eat right now, try to exercise a little, make sure you are taking a multivitamin, and folic acid suppliment. The healthier your body is, the easier it will be to concieve.  But first, you need to make an appt. with your  gynecologist to make sure your body is in the best shape to get pregnant.  Good luck.\n\n",

Hi jeryn, i am not a doctor, however if you want to conceive soon, don't forget to take folic acid at least 1 month before trying.  I have a very similar story to yours, and have ben trying to conceive for over a year now and have had no luck. I am healthy, young and fit and cannot understand what the problem is. i have not been checked out by a doctor as i have been hoping every month that i would conceive.  I am worried and stressed. The last week i have been crying alot, i cant get it of my mind i have also been  snapping at my husband for no reason at all.  He tries to tell me not to stress and this makes me cry even more. My advice to you is to start trying as soon as you know you are ready and don't hold off. you never know how long it might take you to conceive. I hope you don't have to go through what i have been,\n\n",

    "content": "I am 22years old and have been trying to conceive with my husband for over a year.  I am not on any medication and have not been since i can remember.  There has been no history of infertility in my family. I have been taking Blackmores folic acid tablets. My friend is getting married this year and has been talking about having a baby for the last coupke of weeks. She is excited, however it breaks my heart to think that she might conceive straight away while i have been trying for soo long.  I get very emotional on and off and get depressed when i get my period. The last week i have been very emotional and depressed and have been snapping at me husband for no reason.  Its even worse when he asks me if im serious when i tell him i got my period.  A baby is something we both cannot wait to have. I am very jealous when i hear of people conceiving without trying/accidental pregnancies.  To make it worse i work with baby furniture and see pregnant mums and new borns everyday. It breaks my heart to see so many pregnant mums everyday, i look at them and wish that was me. My husband and i have been keeping this a secret all this time and i really cant handle the pressure.  I really want to try Ovulex as it is a natural fertility aid for women, though my husband wants me to wait a little longer to see if we can conceive on our own. He doesnt think there is anything wrong with it taking this long to conceive. He thinks we can do it on our own without any help, but i cant help but wonder how long it would take if we didnt get any help. I am worried that i will never have a baby, something that i want more than anything else in this world.  Any advice would be soo very much appreciated. I am desperate at the moment with no one to talk to. Please help me.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Im 20 years old and about 5 months ago I went to the doctors office because my period had been very late and i thought i migh have been pregnant but I wanst. They couldnt figure out why my period was so late so they had me get a pap test and it came back irregular.  Then i went back a few weeks later and I had this other kind of pap test, where they used a camera to see more closely and they found these white bloches around my cervix opening. And they said it might be cervical cancer but since it wasnt all that bad that i should wait another 6 months to see if its gets worse.  My question to you is if its possible cervical cancer can i still conceive? are there certain medications i can take in order to concivev before it might turn into cervical cancer?\n\n",

    "content": "I am a nursing student. I am actually 2 months pregnant:) I think I have some advice for you. I know you must be anxious to know!! I know I was.  I too had somewhat irregular cycles so what I did is I took the average of the two months cycle length. If you were to do that for you would take 25 and 29 get 27 days being the length of this supposed cycle.  Then using an ovulation calculator online (which I used by the way with my pregnancy) you would get your most fertile time being from Monday, January 16 to Saturday, January 21.   Your period would be due Thursday February 2nd. Buy a 2 pack of HPT's I highly recommend First Response pregnancy test (I have found it to be the best, most sensitive) Take the first test thursday if its negative wait at least 2-4 days and take another. Remember a faint pink result line within the time limit, I believe its 10 minutes is a positive result.  Hold back testing too early. You will feel better trust me.  Good luck I hope this helps you:)\n\n",

The increases in temperature may cause damage to sperm or inhibit the production of new sperm. If the varicocele is not causing symptoms and infertility is not an issue treatment is aimed by supporting the scrotum either with an athletic support or snugly fitting undershorts. If there are symptoms, pain, testicular damage, etc. and a question of fertility, the method of treatment is a surgical procedure.  Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I get sharp pains and cramps in my lower abdomen around the time of ovulation which i've heard can happen to some women. The part i'm unsure about is......if my blader becomes full the pain becomes alot worse and when i empty my blader at the start of emptying it hurts then subsides a little only to hurt real bad again as my bladder emptys. I also get sharp pains shoot through my anus when i sit down (this doesnt happen all the time just every now and then and only when i have the stomach pains) Sometimes i can hardly stand up straight because the pain becomes worse if i try to straighten up. I have always been a very healthy person but the last 12mths have seemed to have alot of health problems and have had to visit the doctor alot more than i'm used to. I'm worried that he'll think i'm \"making it up\" by going to him for different things all the time especially when it's possibly normal symptoms.

    "content": "I am about to make an appointment for my first appointment about my husband and I's fertility. What should I expect?  I think that I might have a hormonal imbalance. My breasts have gone through a lot of changes lately, like growing 2 sizes, my nipples are darker, and have a rougher texture, and are very itchy!!  I have gained weight, my periods are a little heavier, and usually blackish for at least a day, and I get super sensitive swollen breasts and extreme mood swings during my periods, this isnt normal for me, I also have blue veins showing through my breasts. Any insight would help a bunch! Thanks!! :?\n\n",

    "content": "This morning I woke up to a small quantity of blood in my underwear.  This shocked me, for this is only day 23 of my normally 32 day cycle.  I then thought that it could be \"implatation bleeding\" and became terribly frightened. I did have sex three times since my last period-- all during which condoms were used.  My last period was from September 9th to 11th, and the intercourse occured once on the 17th and twice on the 25th.  What are the chances of this being implantation bleeding/ a sign of pregnancy? Please keep in mind that I've been under a terrible amount of stress as of late... for school just started in September and I've been depressed and nervous from stress this entire past week due to what I consider to have been a possible emotional breakdown. I've also started excercising regularly again in about the past ten days.    If I am pregnant, what should I do? Are there any medications I could take to stop the pregnancy?\n\n",

    "content": "It is possible you could be pregnant, however, I would attribute this spotting due to the stress you are under right now. Stress can cause changes to your cycle. Take a home pregnancy test to ease your mind.   As for a drug to stop the pregnancy, the \"morning after pill\" must be taken within 72 hours of intercourse to prevent implantation. At this stage, you would need a medical abortion. Meaning, you would need to find an abortion clinic to give you some medicine to take to pass the embryo. You would get a dose in the ofice, and another dose to take at home, and you would have what would seem like a period.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there. Implantation bleeding typically occurs 5 to 10 days after conception occurs. In order to determine whether you had intercourse within your conception \"window\", depends on your cycle length and regularity.   Also, keep in mind, implantation bleeding tends not to occur in most women. There are some that do in fact experience this bleeding, but this is not a typical \"tell tale sign\" of pregnancy whatsoever.   As Gracie said, it could very well be related to the stress you are experiencing. If you think you are pregnant, and this is an unwanted pregnancy, you need to test immediately so you can plan ahead.\n\n",

    "content": "It is possible to get pregnant this way, the penis does not have to go inside the vagina, and preejaculate does contain sperm that can cause pregnancy, however, it is VERY unlikely pregnancy will occur this way. In order for a pregnancy to occur, the preejaculate( which is a small amount) would have to find its way inside the vagina, and have a long way to travel to cause pregnancy. Most of the sperm would not make it. So although it is unlikely, it is still possible, and the only way to know for sure is to get a pregnancy test. Test now, since the period is late, and if it is negative, wait 2 weeks, if still no period, retest or make an apt. with the gynecologist.\n\n",

So in your case allowing approximately two days prior to your midpoint and two days after your midpoint the most fertile timeframe generally speaking, would be from approximately day 11-17 of your cycle. Keep in mind that I am not implying that pregnancy is an impossibilty but according to the timeframe you stated if your cycles are regular, it's probably not likely. Don't stay stressed over the situation as stress may alter a menstrual cycle. If your cycle doesn't appear on time then perform a pregnancy test to rule it out.  Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "I'm usually have a pretty normal  period cycle that has NEVER been over 30 days.  Today is day 33 and I haven't gotten my period yet.  I just recently started having sex since my last period and was wondering if that causes any hormonal changes that may delay my period?    I used condoms every time we had sex and the condom never broke.  Two weeks ago, I got really scared because I felt tremendous discomfort down there and had to pee more and I felt nauseated for one night.  Could that be signs of fertilization?  Then I felt nothing for a week or so.  But now that my period hasn't come yet, i'm getting freaked out again.  Sometimes I think its all in my head because i start worrying and then I think i feel all these symptoms.  My breasts feel really tender and I was pretty emotional this past week.  Do you think I could be pregnant?  I've never had a delayed/missed period before and am pretty regular (only one irregular cycle of around 20 days long)\n\n",

The tender breasts and emotional feelings can be a sign of your impending period, or a sign of pregnancy.  The only way to know for sure is to take a pregnancy test. An at home test should be accurate if taken now.  Good luck.\n\n",

She also read that the operation to correct them should be done as early as possible to preserve fertilty and is rather concerned that mine wasn't carried out until i was 7.

    "content": "If undescended testes are not treated by early surgical correction, they may not produce healthy spermatozoa. If diagnosed and treated in infancy or childhood, most testes develop and function normally, reducing the risks of unhealthy spermatozoa. However, there is an association between previous undescended testes and infertility.   Recent data suggests that 40% of all infertility is ascribed entirely, or in part, to male factors, 40% to female factors with an additional 20% unexplained.  Two months of trying for a baby is too short a time to cause concern \u2013 twelve months is a good interval. Have you undergone semen analysis tests?  In assessing male infertility, DNA fragmentation levels are now considered more significantly reliable than conventional semen measurements for count, motility and morphology. The result is reported in three statistical categories: Excellent fertility potential Good to fair fertility potential Poorer fertility potential  If you are concerned, this investigation would be a first step in the right direction.

Obviously we missed the month of October for pregnancy but based on a 27day cycle, you should get your period approx on 11/6. That would make your most fertile time 11/14 -11/19 - the 19th being the most fertile day.   There are about 5-6 fertile days during each menstrual cycle: The day of ovulation and the 4-5 days immediately preceding ovulation. Those days are the best days to try to get pregnant - though it can happen at ant time. You might want to try an ovulation predictor kit & speaking to your OBGYN for advice.   Regarding your other question of could have the relations had on the 24th been it - its very possible. Based on your period starting on Oct 10th - your most fertile day this month was Oct. 24th   Best of Luck. Let us know how your doing\n\n",

(This is a wonderful tool to predict ovulation) Try 1-2 tsp of Robitussin before sex. (This has the same effect on cervical mucous as it does on mucous in the lungs. It lets the sperm get into to cervix opening) After sex, prop a pillow under the rear and stay in place for about 20 minutes. Lastly, do not obsess. If you are stressed, it makes things more difficult. Remember, even 100% healthy couples can take up to ONE YEAR to get pregnant.   If you feel you are getting nowhere, consider discussing this with your OBGYN, or a fertility specialist.\n\n",

I'm assuming you are speaking of something like Depo Provera not \"jab\" as in \"stab\" or pain but \"jab\" as in the slang term for a needle version of contraception?  That is a slang used often & what I'm thinking you are referring to and so, yes, it is found to be very effective in many patients as a form of contraception. To take the product to simply stop periods, this is not what it is intended for, nor is it very healthy for your system to do.   As annoying as your period may be, its a natural process that must & should take place & by trying to minipulate that is not very wise in my opinion.   If you would like more information on how contraceptives such as that one work,for that intention, please feel free to write back w/your questions  Best of Luck\n\n",

Well this morning I also took Xenadrine EFX (which is a weight loss supliment, it says on the back: Light-skinned individuals should limit UV exposure when consuming this product) along with a depression medicine.  Then right after I took it, I ran to subway and ate a sub then went tanning.  Then right after tanning, my husband called and asked me to pick up some lunch at McDonalds for him and the smell really bothered me.  So when I got home I threw up...by the looks and smell of it, I think it was my sub.  Do you think I am pregnant or is it just a combination of all those things plus the xenadrine?!?!\n\n",

    "content": "All women are different, but generally ovulation is the 14th day of your menstrual cycle. Your cycle begins on the first day of your period. So 14 days after that is ovulation. A woman's fertile period during her menstrual cycle, on average, lasts about nine days: seven days before ovulation (the release of the egg), the day of ovulation, and the day after ovulation. After this, chances of conception decrease quickly, as the egg has a short life-span of about 24 hours.   Ther best thing for you to do is wait until your next period, and if it is late, take a home pregnancy test. Some tests allow you to test 5 days before your expected period if you are to worried to wait.\n\n",

    "content": "The most important thing to remember is even totally healthy couples can take up to one year to conceive a child. The timing in conception must be perfect. Let me give you some insight and ideas.  On the pot smoking: Yes, marijuana HAS been linked to lower sperm counts. Keep in mind that this does not mean every man who smokes pot is not capable of conception. I really do not think his teenage past is to blame. After all, it has been over 3 yrs since he has done it.   Secondly, have you considered trying ovualtion sticks? They are a wonderful tool in catching the perfect timing like I mentioned above. If you don't know what they are, I will briefly explain: The sticks are to be peed on, and they help to give you a heads up as to when ovulation is coming. These sticks can dramatically increase odds.   I know no couple wants to wait a full year to have a baby, but keep in mind that you are probably a normal, capable, couple. It is just gonna take some time.  Hope that helps -\n\n",

I have been bleeding for 20 days now with the first few days being heavy and having a steady light flow since.  My first period resumed 4 months postpartum and was light and only lasted 5 days, approx 4 weeks later I started my second period.  With it I resumed my birth control.  I am taking the same b.c. as before I became pregnant and it had always shortened and regulated my periods.  Is prolonged bleeding normal with postpartum periods because of the hormonal changes?  My cycle was 24 days before, so is it possible that I will continue bleeding into my next period with no break?  If this is common, how long can I expect these lengthened periods to last?  And lastly, should I be taking any supliments such as iron because of the excess blood loss?  Btw, I am still breastfeeding approx. 7 times per 24 hours.\n\n",

It is very important to be seen, or call your doctor. Also, start using pads, rather than tampons. You want to be able to tell the office how much bleeding is occuring. For example, you should not be soaking a pad within an hour or less. As far as supplements, yes, you need to take a prenatal. Most doctors want you to continue a prenatal vitamin until 6 weeks PP, or keep it up longer if breastfeeding. If you have been bleeding 20 days now, that is cause for concern. Please track your pads, and call the doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Its hard to say if you could or could not conceive naturally. I know you mentioned that the tubal surgery was not successful. Some questions I have are, how long did you try to conceive after surgery before turning to IVF? Have you been actively trying to conceive recently?   I noticed you live in Scotland, and I am not sure if there are certain regulations with IVF there. In the USA, I have know several people who have had more than one IVF done and had more than one IVF baby. I don't see why you could not have another.   Best of luck to you with everything.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 37 years old and am in the early stages of IVF.  My FSH level is currently at 11.7 (it was at 10 nine months ago).    For years I've had problems with \"white gunk\" in the back of my throat and at my last dentist appointment, I was told I should probably see a doctor because it looked my tonsils looked really inflamed.  I went to an ENT who said that I have Tonsil Stones and that they are causing me to get chronic low-grade infections which is why my tonsils get inflamed.  I also get Strep throat at least every other year.  The ENT said that sometimes these types of low-grade infections can inhibit your ability to get pregnant and that it might benefit me to have my tonsils out before IVF.    I haven't started the shots yet for IVF so it is early enough to stop the process.  Should I get my tonsils out now and then postpone the IVF for a month?  Or, because of the rising FSH level, should I go ahead with IVF and get my tonsils out at some later date (there is no immediate danger with the tonsils).    I appreciate the help!\n\n",

    "content": "I will be honest, I have never known tonsillitis to be related to infertility. I am not questioning the ENT's professional opinion, as I am sure he is knowledgable in this area.   I think that getting them removed first as he suggested may be best. Considering how complex, and not to mention costly, IVF can be, it is better to increase the odds. Of course I don't think waiting on the surgery is going to directly affect IVF since fertilization is not dependent on the physiological processes of the body.   Here is a big thing to consider. Let's say you DO put off the surgery, then have the IVF first and achieve pregnancy. I think it would be best to not have to deal with a surgery while pregnant if at all possible.   Let me know what you decide, and best of luck with your IVF.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  During intercourse sometimes condoms can come off but not every time this leads to pregnancy.  The symptoms you have at present are from what you say normal during your period but again these symptoms can also be present during the first stages of pregnancy.  Best advice to you is to attend your physician or family planning centre and have a pregnancy test done .  Or you can buy a home testing kit from your local pharmacy so that you can carry out the test yourself without anyone else knowing. This way you can be sure one way or the other. However if you carry out a home pregnancy test and the result is negative you really should see your physician just to be sure as some home kits can give false readings.  Good luck and best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I cannot find any documentation concerning phentermine and fertility.  From the pharmacological view if you are trying to get pregnant : Phentermine is a strong stimulant, raising blood pressure putting mom and baby at risk. Phentermine is addictive, putting mom and potential baby at risk.  A year is a long time to be on a stimulant/anorectic.  Not only can  tolerance be built up, but coming off of the medication after this amount of time will leave you feeling fatigued for a time while your body returns to regulating its own stimulants.    Get in touch with your physician.  If you are trying to become pregnant, you first need to get off of the phentermine for your safety and for the potential wee one.  Pregnancy brings its own blood pressure issues to both you and your baby.  Phentermine has not been studied during pregnancy or nursing, but putting two health risks together certainly is not going to help either one.  You need to get your body in the best, self-sufficient shape possible for you before making it home to fragile cargo.    Good luck and best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am not a doctor or even in the medical profession, but I am offering some advice that relates to when I was on the pill. Basically, you are putting hormones into your body and for obvious reasons, the less time using any form of unecessary chemicals the better. I was informed by my doctor, that I should be off the pill for at least 3 months before trying to get pregnant, just to be on the safe side.  I was on the pill for 5 years and have been off of it for about 2 years, but wish i didn't stay on for as long as I did. You will not gain any weight going off the pill ( you will probably lose weight) and your periods will no longer be exactly on schedule. you may experience a heavier flow and more cramping if you go off the pill. my advice is ...if you're planning on getting pregnant in the next year or so, it might be time to go off the pill.  If you have no intentions in getting pregnant for a long time, then you might as well stay on it for a while longer.   Although six years is a while to be on the pill, i know people who have been on it much longer (over a decade), and have had no problems becoming pregnant. hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a question and i don't really want to go to the doctor about it. Me and my boyfriend have been together for 1yr and 3months now. Im 16 and he's 17. I am generally quite responsible with the pill and contraception, however there have been quite a few times when i could have fallen pregnant, we went through a rough patch and i stopped taking the pill so when we got back together i wasnt protected for about a week and a half and there have been a few other times aswell. The thing is, of course i don't want a baby at this age but i am very worried that i might not be able to get pregnant. This has been worrying me for some time now, and i would just like to be sure if the is something wrong with either of us in that way.I know it sounds silly but i would rather be safe than sorry and catch something early on. I know we won't get much advice online but i was just wondering if anyone could give us a little bit of advice about this or even tell us what to expect if we were to go to the doctors. Any information you could give would be highly appreciated. Thanks very much.\n\n",

Usually, a couple is advised to have workup for infertility after a year long living together with unprotected sex. Hence, I would say that you begin worrying regarding this from then on. If you did get pregnant by then, you can do a urine pregnancy test from home when you miss a cycle.  Hope that helps.  bill\n\n",

    "content": "Hi babbasi, Generally speaking it is not considered a problem until approximately a year after trying to conceive and are unsuccessful. Have you had a gynecological exam? Did it reveal any anomalies? A couple of ways that may help you detect ovulation are monitoring your basal body temperature. Temperatures elevate slightly during your fertile times.  Also watch for changes in cervical mucous. During ovulation cervical mucous becomes thinner \"more slippery\" sort of like eggwhites. Observing these things may assist you in trying to conceive  Good Luck to you! Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Clomid Question, Fertility Issue",
    "content": "Hi there,  I am not a doctor but I do have a modest medical background, plus, more significantly, I was an infertility patient at a major infertility center in Southern California, USA, for several years before becoming pregnant and giving birth to a healthy baby girl in 2000. Therefore I wouldl like to give you my opinion re your questions and then refer you to the website for the center that I went to. Their website, I believe, has a question and answer section and they may be able to email with you or even answer a few ofyour questions by phone.  First of all, one of the several factors that impacted my fertility was the fact that both of my tubes were blocked, partly because they were scarred by a former episode of chlamydia, which I had suffered years before and was not even aware of!! (Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted disease and one can easily be tested for it.) I have a bit of knowledge re clomid and tubes, and basically, I can tell you that it is likely that the clomid will stimulate both of your ovaries, regardless of your tubes. However, if you have only one tube, that may make it take a bit longer for you to become pregnant, and you definitely will need to tell an infertility specialist about this. If you are in your mid-thirties or older, and regardless of whether you are using high technology or simply trying to become pregnant via sex with a partner, it is critical that you consult with an infertility specialist immediately (not just a regular doctor or a regular gynecologist). Time is especially of the essence for anyone past the early thirties, and for anyone with a problem such as yours.  In my case,  I eventually had both of my tubes removed PRIOR to undergoing IVF (in vitro fertilization) and becoming pregnant, this due to the fact that the scarred tubes were spilling out fluid and were actually intefering with successful IVF. For anyone who does not know, IVF involves the conception of embryos in a laboratory dish, then the implantation of them into the woman's uterus.  I highly suggest that you contact the following clinic, either to consider becoming a client with them (they have many \"long distance\" clients) or to obtain a referral to an infertility clinic near you. You may decide to at least get your initial consultation  and hormone tests/blood tests done via this clinic: Huntington Reproductive Center, Pasadena, California, USA.   Telephone: 626-440-9161.  They have excellent doctors and offices in Pasadena and other cities in Southern California. My doctor, John Wilcox, has a very high success rate and also is very caring and compassionate with all of the clients.  Good Luck to you and feel free to let me know how it goes! Sincerely, Lisa, lisashetler@yahoo.com\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Kristi,  During the pre-ejaculation stage there will be seminal fluid seeping from the tip of the penis and that fluid may contain sperm in it. Than, during the normal ejaculation there are hundreds of millions of sperms in the semen, some of this comes out prior to ejaculation also. Basically, you are never \u201csafe\u201d from those little guys without some type of protection.   Figure out when your last period was, how close to two weeks has it been? The closer it is to 14 days past your period the better it will be for you to become pregnant but if it's almost time for you to start or if you just ended one than the chances are less likely. This is based on a normal 28 day cycle.  Any time there is vaginal penetration without protection or contraceptives or if your protection fails, even for a moment,  the chances of pregnancy is present. In the case you think you may be, here is this information:  Home Pregnancy tests, how do they work?  Home pregnancy urine tests measure hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) which is secreted by the fertilized egg when it implants into the lining of the uterus and starts forming its placenta. The fastest and most accurate test is a blood serum test, you can get them done by a Physician or Health Department. The hormone hCG will start getting into your bloodstream in about 1 week after fertilization and will double about every two days. The sensitivity levels will very depending upon the maker of the pregnancy test so the best time to test is about 1 week past the day the menstruation was expected. I know it\u2019s hard to wait but the only 100% positive answer to the question \u201cAm I pregnant\u201d is time.   If you keep getting negative urine tests and still haven't started your cycle, go see your Physician and get checked right away. If your test comes up positive, go see your Physician or Midwife right away to start your prenatal care.\n\n",

    "content": "At this time there are no solid studies on the effects of tanning beds and sun tanning on ovaries or the unborn child. The UV light used in tanning beds and the suns rays would injure if they touched but they do not reach the child, therefore your baby is not at risk but the heat can cause your body temperature to rise. Spray-on-tanning is another story, it is NOT advised, and as the tanning solution is applied this fine mist is being inhaled. Be sure and clear everything with your Physician prior to doing it.   During your pregnancy your doctor will advise you not to do anything that will raise your body's temperature, such as hot tubs, saunas, and tanning beds, laying in the sun, etc. Two important things to remember are to stay cool and drink plenty of fluids. You may also be advised not to lie on your back in your last trimester because this may cause your baby to become distressed due to the possibility of lowering the blood flow to the placenta. Just use common sense and make sure you are comfortable. It's always best to go with the motto, if you think it's not worth the risk then don't do it!  Keep in contact with your Midwife or Physician during your pregnancy, this little life depends on you.\n\n",

    "content": "Can holding water vaginally cause infertility?  I recently walked into my pre-teen daughter's  room and found her inserting water into her vagina (upside down).  When asked what she was doing and where she got the idea she told me she saw it in a movie, Sybil.  In the movie Sybil's mother tied her legs in the air and used a hot water bottle to insert water into her vagina.  She then made her hold the water for long periods of time as punishment.  This resulted in her being unable to reproduce.  Is this true?  Could this cause damage to her fallopian tubes, uterus or other reproductive organs?  Apparently this has been going on for some time; if it is true : how do we determine if any damage has been caused?\n\n",

Flushing or holding water in her vagina upsets the balance of bacteria etc which clean the walls if the vagina and protect it from infection.   Furthermore; other than watching the movie, what has coaxed her into practicing this? is she sexually active and using this as a birth control method? is she being encouraged to do this by her friends? The reasons why she is doing this needs to be investigated, and this behaviour should stop.\n\n",

HER BIRTHDAY IS JANUARY 22 SO IT HAS ALMOST BEEN A YEAR. THE DOCTORS TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A LESS THAN ONE PERCENT CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING AGAIN. SO, I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF TRYING AGAIN. FOR A LITTLE WHILE MY PERIODS SEEMED TO BE REGULAR. THEY WERE COMING EVERY 30 DAYS. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY STARTED COMING EVERY TWO WEEKS AND THEN LAST MONTH IT WAS 38 DAYS BEFORE I GOT MY PERIOD. MY QUESTION IS, IF I WANT TO CONCIEVE A PREGNANCY CAN IT BE DONE WITH SUCH AN IRREGULAR MENSTRAL CYCLE AND IF SO HOW? HOW DO I KNOW  WHEN A \"GOOD TIME\" TO BE WITH MY PARTNER IS.

    "content": "Dear Courage,  It is not known whether or not ephedrine can cause infertility or not as studies were never conducted on animals to test this potential side effect.  This side effect is also not mentioned among all the various side effects that ephedrine can cause.  If you are using ephedrine or any ephedra to lose weight as it appears from your other posts, the fda has put a ban on the use of ephedra containing products used for weight loss earlier this year.  Please refer to this link for the fda position on ephedra containing products.  If you are so worried about this side effect, don't use ephedrine.  About losing weight, your numbers show that you are already underweight, and if you want to go down to 95 pounds, you are going to be extremely underweight. Do you need to lose weight to be able to compete in an athletic event? What is it that you want to achieve besides just losing weight as a goal?  To see what is your ideal body weight please use our online calculator.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

On 15 November I had a sudden surge in temperature/fever. I felt like I was getting a cold and then it just went away. My breasts appear fuller and more swollen, but there is no pain. The areola don't look dark altogether, but there is a dark ring around the edges of both of them.  On Friday, 26th November I had a feeling of pressure on my right ovary - and I kept running to the toilet to pee - as soon as I was done I'd need to back. As the day went on I kept going to the loo. By Saturday evening the pain on the right had intensified, it was almost unbearable- it only went away mid-Sunday afternoon.  Today, I had twinges of cramping in my lower abdomen, but that has been on an off ?  Does this sound like implantation ,or could it just be ovulation ? Any thoughts ?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Dauera,  It is important to create time to see a doctor, first for a blood pregnancy test (if urine tests were negative) and secondly to ascertain the cause of your severe headaches. Severe, persistent headache is not a usual sign of pregnancy and it may be a more important complaint than your desire to know if you are pregnant.  Stress/tension headache is the usual cause of bilateral, non-pulsatile headache. Hypertension may also present as headache. Some headaches, such as migraine and cluster headaches, are disabling and treatable while others are sinister and are the types that must be recognised.   Consultation with a doctor will be most rewarding. I advise you to see one as soon as possible. Thank you for contacting our website.

I did not have a menstrual period from May through September 2004. After 5-months of not bleeding I finally got my period on 10/16/2004. I had visited my doctor prior to getting my period. My doctor prescribed me PROVERA 10mg for 10 days only. I told my doctor that I  had gotten my period, but she suggested that I still take the PROVERA to get all the blood out of my system since I had not bled for five months. When I started taking PROVERA on 10/25/04 I was still bleeding, but I stopped bleeding the following day 10/26/04. But my bleeding continued from 10/27/04 through 11/10/04.   My husband already had his sperm count and his results were 13ML and my doctor told me that his sperm was good and that it only took one sperm to get me pregnant. I too have been checked and all is fine with me.  My question is how to track my ovaluation date(s). Should I be expecting another normal period in the month of December 2004?\n\n",

In anovulation (= cessation of ovulation), if bleeding occurs at the same time each month (making you think it is menstruation) it is actually break-through bleeding caused by low estrogen. Most women with anovulation however, will have no bleeding.   There are many causes to anovulation which i am sure your doctor will have investigated. One of these causes is that your hormones are not capable to induce ovulation. In this case attempts will be made using drugs that induce ovulation. In other cases assisted reproduction techniques may be employed.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Cristy,  Infertility work-up usually starts by a physical examination for both the male and female. This is important to find out about anatomical abnormalities that might be present and prevent conception.  Then, a semen analysis is absolutely necessary.   If the semen analysis is normal, i think the next step is to find out whether the female is ovulating or not and there are several things to detect ovulation starting from taking your body temperature after menstruation (usually, the ovulating female has 0.5 degrees celsius higher in her temperature after ovulation) down to hormonal tests and ultrasounds and others.  After making sure that the female is ovulating, i think the next step is to make sure that the environment in which the sperms travel to reach the ovum is suitable.  Each of the steps can take a while because ultrasounds and blood tests are needed.   If it is decided that assisted conception is needed, there are several ways to do it, but i will leave explaining this to the pros.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Martinezfive,  Ovulation and menstruation is a complex hormonal process. The events leading to ovulation lead to increase in thickness of the uterine lining by releasing a hormone called estrogen.  When it comes to contraceptive pills, i think the 4th generation (the latest) supply very minute amounts of estrogen just enough to suppress ovulation but at the same it is estrogen so it is going to affect the lining of the uterus and estrogen causes the lining of the uterus to thicken.  i am not sure whether the amount of estrogen in those pills is enough to affect the uterine lining or not, but i think it is a sufficient amount to cause thickening of the uterine lining, so i don't think you have to worry about the uterine lining being thin.

The past five months I have gotten my period on a Tuesday (prior to that it was usually Wednesday, rarely it came on a Thursday).  This month, however, I did not get my period until this morning (Thursday, so two days late).  My blood flow is a lot less than it usually is and I have no cramping (I usually do).  (I have exercised the past two weeks a little more than normal, but nothing strenuous, just a little walking and time at the gym). I took an EPT pregnancy test this morning and it came back negative.  What are the odds that I am pregnant?\n\n",

    "content": "In 1972 Vaitukaitis, Braunstein, and Ross published their paper describing the hCG beta-subunit radioimmunoassay that could finally distinguish between hCG and LH, therefore making it potentially useful as an early test for pregnancy. Please read their article here!  In 1976 the FDA approval was sought by Warner-Chilcott for e.p.t, the \u201cEarly Pregnancy Test\u201d later known as the \u201cError Proof Test.\u201d e.p.t would become the first home pregnancy test kit on the market in the United States.  It was not until the 90s when advances in the technology of pregnancy tests included the development of new types of antibodies and the use of enzyme labels in place of radioactive labels.  Currently, the highest possible screening sensitivity for an hCG-based pregnancy test conducted on the first day of a missed period is 90 percent, as 10 percent of women may not have implanted yet. It is estimated that the highest possible screening sensitivity of a home pregnancy test by one week after the first day of the missed period is 97 percent (approximately 5 weeks from the last period).   If you have just ovulated, the earliest you can get a positive result on the most sensitive pregnancy tests is seven days after ovulation. Implantation needs to occur before hCG is produced, and that generally happens 10 days after.\n\n",

I am otherwise healthy - correct height/weight ratio, exercise regularly, no smoking or drinking, no prescription drug use....  We tried the ovulation drugs for a few months to no avail; also did the temperature thing (mine never changed!) and so on...  My husband's sperm count is fine, but still after 5 years we have not been able to achieve pregnancy.  My question is:  What is the best next step - hysterosalpingogram or a visit to an endocrinologist?  One provides an insight as to whether there is a physical blockage, and is only good for about 3 months as far as opening up any scar tissue I might have in my fallopian tube; the other may provide insight as to whether this is a hormone problem or not.  So - which one first?  Thanks.  Laura\n\n",

Yesterday, while out shopping, I felt a surge of wetness and on checking, found clear white mucus (so I guess I'm ovulating now ?)  How long does ovulation last ? How soon after ovulation can one test for pregnancy ?\n\n",

As for how soon after ovulation should one perform a pregnancy test: a week after ovulation.  N.B. You previously, reported on this website white mucus on the 4th of June. Are you on hormonal therapy for ovulation induction?\n\n",

But I've had the appearance of white mucus today and I'm afraid AF is on her way.  Is white mucus a sign of menstruation or could it be a sign of early pregnancy ?\n\n",

    "content": "The highest possible screening sensitivity for an hCG-based pregnancy test conducted on the first day of a missed period is 90 percent, as 10 percent of women may not have implanted yet. It is estimated that the highest possible screening sensitivity of a home pregnancy test by one week after the first day of the missed period is 97 percent (approximately 5 weeks from the last period).  If you have just ovulated, the earliest you can get a positive result on the most sensitive pregnancy tests is seven days after ovulation. Implantation needs to occur before hCG is produced, and that generally happens 10 days after. For this reason, it makes economical sense to wait until 10-12 days after ovulation, but even then a significant percentage of women who are indeed pregnant will still show a negative result.\n\n",
