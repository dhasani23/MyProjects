    "content": "I'm a 36 year old male. When I kit 395 pounds made a change and hit the gym. After 6 months and little result decided to low carb. I was taking optiman vitamins and protien powder after my workouts. Doing heavy weights for an hour then cardio for about 40 minutes. Keeping my heart rate between 130 and 157. Lost 50 pounds in about 6 months and then one day I had no juice left. Went home to rest then had a warm feeling all over, short of breath, faint , and hard to speak. Went to the er and had ECG monitor for 24 hours. Ultra sound. X rays and blood work. Everthing was good except for a slight arithmia. Discharged. Then a week later felt great I decided to go to the gym again was doing fine until I picked up a heavy weight,then felt faint again. I went home and saw the doctor the next day. Did ECG  ultra sound. Xrays. Blood work. And everything was good. Bad Cholesterol 120 good cholesterol 40. Sugar was great. Kidney function normal. Again everything looked great. A week later went to the gym again and decided to just do cardio. Well I kept an eye on my heart rate and noticed it stayed at 118 and I tried to pick it up but it just wouldn't go. 20 minutes in I felt light headed and faint again.  So now I still feel the effects of that last workout. Had a paramedic friend run a strip on me and he said the t waves were slightly elevated and my blood pressure was 175/93  and I have been getting bad sharp headaches also. I'm just waiting on Insurace to go to the doctor but if I can find help in some way before that I would be relieved. Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: High blood pressure/ elevated t waves/ weak with exercise",
    "content": "Hi, Exercise causes elevations in serum potassium.The degree of elevation depends on several factors including the severity of the excercise. Although the ECG had shown elevated T waves, it can not be fully relied upon, as ECGs recorded during exercise are prone to certain disturbances (for example, electrical, electromagnetic or from involuntary muscular activity) which affect the tracing. However, as you had experienced symptoms, a symptomatic dysrhythmia needs to be excluded.   Ventricular premature contractions(VPCs) for instance, tend to disappear during heavy excercise and may reappear following cessation of exercise or at lower exercise levels. Hyperkalemia may contribute to this. Normally, acidosis has a protective action against hyperkalemia induced VPCs during heavy exercises. VPCs can occur in otherwise structurally normal hearts, but more common in the presence of underlying heart disease(ischemic heart disease/cardiomyopathy) or electrolye abnormalities such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. African american race,hypertension and advanced age are other risk factors.  You indicate that you were a heavy abuser of cocaine and gave it up in 2000. Cocaine induced cardiomyopathy may persist for varying degrees following complete cessation of cocaine abuse.This needs to be excluded as well. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Can paroxysmal AF be a secondary effect",
    "content": "I have occasional episodes of what my doctor thinks is paroxysmal AF. It always starts at night and may last several hours but eventually I return to normal sinus rhythm. My pulse rises to 90 - 100 and my BP is 130/70. My  EGC is normal when I do not have the problem.  I have seen a cardiologist and currently I am wearing a loop monitor to try to \"catch\" an episode but nothing has happened for 12 days. I have been prescribed Sotalol 40 mg twice a day. Blood tests have revealed nothing abnormal - glucose level, kidney function, liver function, thyroid activity are all normal . A chest X ray and an echo cardiogram also look normal. I am 75 years of age and reasonably physically active. The episodes of AF almost always occur when my digestive system is upset - I have a small hiatus hernia and despite using Omeprazole,  Gaviscon etc I have, in recent years, experienced quite a lot of indigestion. An endoscopy 2 years ago revealed the hernia but nothing else  - no growths or problems in the stomach, but I wonder whether an upset digestion can trigger a reaction in my nervous system which brings these episodes on. I know that the important vagus nerve runs close to the heart and I wonder whether this can be a factor. I am searching for a cause. My doctor is reluctant to accept that it is a secondary effect and he thinks its a primary problem. So far nobody has suggested an ablation or any other treatment. My resting heartbeat is 50 - 55,so the cardiologist is reluctant to increase the dose of Sotalol . Advice whould be welcome\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Can paroxysmal AF be a secondary effect",
    "content": "Hello hotgolfer,  You have done your homework!  Most paroxysmal AF is caused by heart disease or abnormality.  However, 12 to 30% do not involve underlying cardiac disease and are classified as \"lone AF\" (LAF) or \"paroxysmal atrial AF.\"  The diagnosis is dependent on the quality and quantity of testing to rule out underlying conditions.  Recent research suggests that inflammation of the lining of the heart is frequently present in persons who have been diagnosed with LAF.  LAF is a chronic cardiac disorder rather than an acute episode of heart disease.  It can be either paroxysmal, persistent or permanent.  The paroxysmal type converts to normal sinus rhythm by itself, and episodes usually last less than 24 hours, although they can last up to 7 days.  Persistent LAF lasts longer than 7 days and is responsive to cardioversion.  Permanent LAF is just that: permanent.  It does not respond to cardioversion.  Paroxysmal LAF generally increases with age and the number of years the disorder has occurred.  Paroxysmal LAF can progress to permanent LAF.  Many physicians believe there are two types of paroxysmal LAF, due to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system.  One type is \"adrenergic\" and is due to an over-active sympathetic (adrenergic) nervous system, and is primarily found in older people.  LAF episodes generallly occur in daytime, and is often related to exercise or emotional stress.  The second type is \"vagal\", and is associated with an over-active parasympathetic nervous system.  It's generally found in athletes and people with digestive problems.  The key feature is that it occurs at night, usually ends by morning, and lasts from a few minutes to several hours.  Rest, digestive periods (after a meal) and alcohol use are predisposing features.  Frequent urination often occurs in the early phase of paroxysmal LAF.  It rarely develops into permanent LAF.  Paroxysmal LAF is not life-threatening, and surgical intervention (ablation) may be considered.  With vagal type LAF, Flecainide and disopyramide have been effective in preventing episodes; both can have serious adverse effects, so must be monitored, as with any medication.  They are classified as antiarrhythmics.  Beta blockers and sotalol are contraindicated with vagal LAF, as they increase vagal dominance of the autonomic nervous system.  Propafenone has some beta-blocker properties, but appears to be effective for most people with vagal type LAF.  Time-release Propafenone (Rhythmol SR) is often the most effective.  Recommended dosages for persons weighing less than 155 lbs are Flecainide 200 mg and Propafenone 450mg.  For persons over 155 lbs, the recommended dosages are Flecainide 300mg and Propafenone 600mg.  Persons taking these medications have found that swallowing the pill with warm water as soon as possible after the onset of an LAF episode and lying on one's back after swallowing the pill may cause a more rapid conversion to normal sinus rhythm.  Diltiazem is the preferred calcium channel blocker in persons with LAF, as Digoxin increases the number of LAF episodes, especially in the vagal type, and can lead to permanent LAF.  I hope this information is helpful to you, and I am forwarding your post to the other members of the cardiology team for review.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "PVCs:  the role of low ferritin and/or low blood total CO2?",
    "content": "I am a 28-year-old female with no significant medical history, no prescriptions, etc.   In March 2010, I began experiencing heart palpitations (initially a couple a day building to one every minute or so at their worst).  The doctor I saw let me activate the EKG/rhythm strip machine when I felt like I was having the palps, and after looking at the sheets, he diagnosed them as PVCs.  He listened to my heart and did not detect a murmur or any other abnormalities.  At my request, he ran a chemistry panel and thyroid tests -- everything was normal.  He told me that they were harmless and to forget about them.  Luckily, I discovered the wonders of magnesium on my own, and the PVCs pretty much disappeared -- until now.  About 3 weeks ago, they came back gradually at first, then in full-force (sometimes one every minute for a little while, sometimes one every half hour...probably 80 - 100/day), and now they're very intermittent.  Because my doctor was fairly dismissive of the issue, I've taken it upon myself to do some research and try to find the underlying cause.  The magnesium isn't working this time.  I've also tried several supplements - Taurine, L-Arginine, Calcium (with the magnesium), extra B6 to help magnesium get into my cells, and a few others.  Nothing seems to help.  I read that, in addition to electrolyte imbalances upsetting the heart's electrical signals, low iron can cause palps.  So...the other day, I ordered myself some blood tests (via Econolabs online).  I ordered a complete chemistry panel, a cholesterol test, a ferritin test, and a RBC magnesium test.    It's probably important but embarrassing to note that I have eaten extremely poorly over the past few months (since my palps went away back in March...before that, I also ate poorly) -- lots of fast food (at least once a day - sometimes more), virtually no fruits or vegetables (other than potatoes) -- my diet has been trash.  :(    After getting the results today, I'm concerned about my total carbon dioxide and my ferritin levels (my magnesium RBC had to be re-done because the lab didn't use the right tube - am waiting on those results).  Everything else in the chemistry panel was pretty much right in the middle of the range.  Here are my results so far:    CHOLESTEROL: Total:  171 mg/dL; 100-199 Triglycerides:  43 mg/dL; 0-149 HDL: 52 mg/dL; >39 LDL:  110 mg/dL; 0-99  (The LDL cholesterol isn't spectacular and definitely needs to be lowered but isn't bad enough to cause palps, I don't think.)    CARBON DIOXIDE, TOTAL:  17 mmol/L; 20-32  FERRITIN, SERUM:  26 ng/dL; 13-150  I'm wondering if that ferritin level is low enough to reflect low iron that could be causing the heart palpitations.  I understand that it's technically in the \"normal\" range, but it's my understanding that these ranges aren't qualitative such that, as long as you're in the range, you have no symptoms.  Can some people have symptoms at the lower end?  Could it be that my really poor diet has caused me to become somewhat iron deficient?  Could an iron shortage also relate to the low CO2?  (When I went to have my RBC magnesium redone today, I had them do another carbon dioxide test just to see if it had improved because I've had fewer PVCs since the initial test.)  Also...could the low CO2 simply be caused by the blood being drawn pretty much as soon as I sat down in the chair (after briskly walking down the hall)?  One other possibility:  because I figured there was a strong emotional/mental connection to the PVCs, I've been trying to do a lot of deep breathing in an effort to calm myself, but maybe I induced the lower CO2 by breathing so deeply (essentially overbreathing).   On a happier note, since they started again, I have been eating much better...lots of real food...meat, fruit, lots of green leafies, etc.  They have definitely lessened.  While I've experienced quite a few of them tonight, I didn't have any for most of the morning and afternoon (even when sitting still).    I would love some input since PVCs, even when supposedly \"harmless,\" are very troubling!  I know I've written a lot, but I wanted to provide as much relevant information as I could.  Thanks so much for your time!\n\n",

I had a 24 hour holter monitor put on today, the areas that the nurse stuck the patches wasn't prepped with anything before they were applied, just following an echocardiogram. They told me it would be ok to workout with the monitor on, so I did. I sweat, and now they are starting to peel in a couple places. I know if they aren't stuck on properly they won't get accurate or clear results. Can I just place medical tape over them to secure them, or will that not help to ensure clear results?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: How do I keep my holter monitor patches from falling off?",
    "content": "Hi, If reliable recordings of the cardiac electrical activity has to take place during Holter monitoring (more so, in the case of ambulatory monitoring), - the self adhesive electrodes should be fixed to the skin securely and - the lead wires should be securely hooked on to to the recorder(monitor box).  The Holter monitor recordings are subject to a number of \"disturbances\". Some of these are directly related to the electrode-skin interface. These are,  - Electrode contact noise: variable contact between the electrode and the skin, causes baseline drifts in the tracing. - Motion artifacts: shifts(drifting) in the baseline caused by changes in the electrode-skin impedance.  There are other factors as well to which improperly fixed electrodes may contribute, such as, - Muscle contraction: may generate electromyogram(EMG)-type of signals and which get mixed with the ECG signals. - Respiratory artefats: causing  baseline drifts.  Therefore, proper fixing of the electrodes is mandatory for dependable recordings.If you have concerns about the security of these electrodes, you should contact your doctor and discuss your concerns rather than to try fixing the electrodes with medical tape (which is unlikely to do any good to the wobbly EKG tracings other than preventing the electrodes falling off!). Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "bradycardia with stroke like symptoms",
    "content": "I was recently taken to the ER with what appeared to be a stroke.  Upon arrival I was given Ativan and the symptoms subsided slowly. I was admitted and had a series of multiple tests ran including, MRI and MRA of brain, Full body CAT scan, several EKG's, EEG, lab work, Carotid doppler, and CT of spine.  I was placed on a telemetry and it was discovered that I now have bradycardia with heart rates of 28 to 48 at rest and with activity.  I was then transferred to a specialized cardiac unit where they performed a arteriogram with no significant findings other than the bradycardia.  This is the 2nd episode in 8 years of this and the symptoms were almost identical each time.  The only difference is that this time, I responded quicker to the Ativan.  However, this time, I was also 30 minutes closer to the ER.   I am so frustrated about this and cannot get a diagnosis of anything.   Prior to this, I had been having severe back pain, heaviness in my left leg and arm, headaches and extreme fatigue. I just don't know where else to turn!!!!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: bradycardia with stroke like symptoms",
    "content": "Hi, The clinical presentation of bradycardias may range from the totally asymptomatic to those with very fleeting & minor symptoms.The more severely symptomatic ones can cause symptoms such as  - dizziness,  - falls, - fainting episodes,  - confusion, - palpitations,  - exertional fatigue,and  - chest pain.   Common pathological conditions that cause bradycardia are Sinus node dysfunction(sick sinus syndrome), atrio-ventricular block or a combination of the two.  Sinus node dysfunction (SND): a collective name given to a number of disorders which manifest as significant brady-arrhythmias such as - chronotropic incompetence, - sinus arrest/pause, - sinoatrial exit block, and - sinus bradycardia.  Fundamentally, SND can be - intrisic (age related abnormalities in sinus node impulse formation and conduction),or - extrinsic (due to causes outside the heart).  Intrinsic sick sinus syndrome is an irreversible dysfunction of the S-A node (sino-atrial node),due to a chronic fibrotic degeneration or calcification in/or around it.  Atrioventricular block(A-V block) is due to a failure in the conduction of electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles usually caused by conduction defects at the AV node, bundle of His and/or bundle branches. Classified as  first- degree,second-degree or third -degree A-V block. Partial A-V blocks can be asymptomatic but, carry a high risk of progression to complete block.  Diagnosis: of sick sinus syndrome and A-V block is based on - the symptoms,   - electrocardiographic findings [EKG],& - ambulatory ECG (Holter monitoring).  Prognosis: is difficult to predict and variable because it depends on the presence or absence as well as severity of co-morbid conditions(notably ischaemic heart disease) and main underlying cause of the conduction defect.  Pacemakers may be indicated for use in the treatment of symptomatic bradycardias.This can be  - intermittent pacing or - continuous pacing  Difficulties in diagnosing/finding a cause:  - intermittent, at times fleeting nature of the episodes( even while on a 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitoring out of hospital, episodes lasting <1 minute and not causing symptoms may not be reported), - multi-factorial etiology in some cases, - very rare causes( inherited genetic defects), - due to adverse effects of drugs(especially in polypharmacy), etc.  Intracardiac electrophysiologic testing (premature atrial stimulation/atrial overdrive pacing) is a controversial option.These are no longer routinely recommended (risks,their poor sensitivity and specificity).  I hope you will find this information useful. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm 26 years old, generally healthy. When i was a teen i was diagnosed with anxiety/depression/ocd. It has been a decade now and throughout those years i have usually expereinced a shocking, fluttering or jolting sensation in my chest area. These started out when i was still in high school and when i was falling asleep during math (no joke). As i was dosing off, i would feel a jolt in my chest that was enough to startle me and make me sit up abruptly. The first time it happend it scared the living heck out of me. But after a while i felt them but paid them no mind. These past weeks my anxiety has shot up due to a little health scare of diverticulitis that i was diagnosed with. with this fresh new anxiety these jolts are back and stronger. When i get these shocks or jolts they make my body jump, sometimes takes my breath, i get dizzy and sometimes the shock will radiate to my arms, legs, head. These shocks get worse with more anxiety which they tend to cause...but they also happen with sudden movements, things that startle you, turning your head etc. Since this time around they are making me dizzy, it is worrying me.   I'm afraid i'm going to pass out and or my heart just stop working. Since i do have anxiety problems it doesnt help the situation...so i don't know if the dizzy feeling is coming from the jolts or from hyperventilation. I scheduled a appt with a cardiologist on Monday 09/22. Should i be worried? is this life threatening?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Jolts, Shocks, fluttering in chest...scaring me a lil bit...",
    "content": "Hello -  What you describe sounds very much like acutely-felt premature heartbeats, probably premature ventricular contractions. While  some people don't feel them at all, others feel them profoundly and are startled the way you are. They can feel like a little flick of flutter sometimes, while at other times they can feel almost like a kick in the chest. It can be very disconcerting. They are almost always innocent and benign, and almost never have any diagnostic or prognostic significance at all, even when they are frequent. The fact is some people have them all the time and are totally unaware of them, while others have them occasionally but feel each one exquisitely. There is no correlation between the sensation and the  \"severity\" of them.   Many things can cause them or aggravate them, and one of the top causes is anxiety. As you've already figured out, they not only can be caused by anxiety, but anxiety can cause them, so it becomes, for some, a vicious cycle. They also occur frequently when  falling asleep,  which would help explain why this would happen when you were dozing in class. They happen  a lot following meals, too, and are aggravated as well by nicotine, caffeine, alcohol,  fatigue, sleep deprivation, lying on one's left side, and the list goes on for pages.  The important thing to know is that they are almost never of any importance, although it is very wise to have this evaluated by a cardiologist in  order to help put your mind at ease.   I might mention also that many people who have mitral valve prolapse (MVP) have these more often than other  people, and are more aware of them. They also are more prone to anxiety and a few other symptoms such as lightheadedness,  faintness, fatigue, migraines, etc. While  MVP is also almost always benign, the symptoms can make some people feel as though they are losing their mind.  Knowing if this is what's going on can help a great deal.   In any case, I'm pretty sure you'll  find your cardiology workup will help put your mind at ease.   Please let us know how your appointment went. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Anxiety over long runs of PVCs/PACs",
    "content": "I am 36, female, average weight, 10 months postpartum with my second child.  I have had PVCs and PACs for over 10 years.  I was told these were benign and have never been on medication to treat them.  I have a history of anxiety and panic attacks, and needless to say, these flip-flops in my chest don't help!  I have had numerous workups to try and ease my anxiety, most frequently during my last pregnancy about a year ago, a normal echo and stress test with only PACs appearing, and a holter (on a really active day) with about 500 PVCs and 3000 PACs.  My doctor (who has now retired) repeatedly told me that I was too healthy to be in his office and to not worry about them unless I started passing out.    My question is that since last spring I have, thank goodness, only a few of them a day but have instead been occasionally having episodes of what seems to be long strings of the ectopic beats.  I'll feel very nervous or panicky about something and feel a surge of adrenaline in my chest and then a few isolated skipped beats which turns into a string of skipped beats which I feel as flip-flops in my chest.  It can vary in length from 3 or 4 to maybe 30-60 secs. of them.  These are different than the bursts of a couple of them I have felt in the past that seems unrelated to anything.  Those were quite fast in succession and over in a flash.  This doesn't feel very rapid, but more like my regular heartbeat with slight pauses in between, but I feel the flipping with each beat.  If I can relax they seem to go away or anyway they resolve on their own.  I don't have any other symptoms, but to be honest I am usually immediately sent into a panic so I'm not really breathing well or anything, but running for the car to go to the hospital:)  (We are pretty far from a hospital though so I'm afraid I wouldn't get there if something is really wrong).  I'm afraid that they might be runs of v-tach or something dangerous, but they don't seem to match up to anything I've seen described on the interenet.  I've had a very rough year with the new baby and having to move in with my mom and my husband away for work, so I know I am very anxious right now.  My therapist says that I am creating these and that I need to relax and ignore them.  My family agrees.  I want to know if it is safe to just ignore them.  If I had something serious enough to be concerned about would I have more symptoms?  I know I can find a new cardiologist in my new town and try to get an event monitor, but I feel that would just encourage me to be even more neurotic about them.  I'm tired of going for workups everytime I feel something new in my chest and I just want to get on with my life without feeling that I'll keel over any minute.  I think I am one of those people who have read too much about these and is too aware of their heart!  Anyway, I wonder if you have any insight about what new arrythmia this could be and if it seems okay to ignore it.  I can't take any medication for them as I am still nursing my baby.  Thanks very much.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Anxiety over long runs of PVCs/PACs",
    "content": "Hi there -- First, you have my unconditional sympathy. This is one of the most common, yet most frustrating medical problems, the variety of ectopic beats and rhythms and how the not only produce but are also produced by anxiety. They are all, as your doctor has inadequately explained, benign -- even when the occur in people with serious heart disease.They are not diagnostic of heart disease even though they can occur with it, because they also occur in normal, healthy people. This renders them medically meaningless, but doctors tend to forget patients are not medical \"cases\" but are people who require a few minutes of extra time to have these things explained properly, otherwise, as I'm sure you've exerienced, the short, brush-off of \"it's nothing\" only leaves one feeling more certain somethng's being missed. It's not, believe me, but doctors could often save themselves and their patients countless hours of interaction and friction by simply taking a little time up front to really clarify these things. Which is one reason for The Doctor's Lounge. You've come to the right place.   In the anxious patient in particular these arrhythmias and ectopic beats become a huge problem because they are self-promoting. They are caused by anxiety -- although they also occur normally anyway -- but also can cause tremedous anxiety. It becomes a vicous cycle.   You've gained some insight into the basic culrpits, PVCs and PACs (which are commonly known to increase a great deal during some pregnancies, and also during times of hormonal change), but the worst thing about anxiety-related symptoms is how they change patterns almost as though there is some malice involved. What you describe as having now is one of two basic things: either it is ventricular bigemeny (a pattern where every other beat is a PVC, which is a regularly irregular rhythm), or it is an \"escape\" rhythm, one of those where an ectopic site in the heart decides it needs to take over for the sinus node. These are slightly faster than the underlying rhythm, and in people with severely slowed sinus rates (various types of heart \"block\") it actually is beneficial. However, when it occurs in an otherwise healthy person, it simply seems as though the heart is pounding or beating forcefully and not especially fast -- maybe 10 beats faster than it was before the irrititable focus took over. The reason these are felt at all is because they sometimes are not in synchrony with the sinus beat, so they take place when the tricuspid valve is closed (not the normal state of affairs) and this causes the beats to feel more strong, even though they are usually quite regular. There are two types of escape rhythm, one arising from the atrioventricular node (acccelerated juntional rhythm or AJR), and accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR) -- the latter carrying the \"idio\" prefix because no one really knows where it arises or exactly how it works. Both are, however, completely benign. Both tend to run between 60 - 100 beats per minute, depending upon the underlying sinus rate (rarely more than 10-15 beats above that), so when properly synchronized are not noticed at all. If however they are out of synchrony with the sinus impulse, they will be felt as palptiations and can be very annoying. All three of these potential culprits are not only harmless, they can pass unnoticed or can be very uncomfortable, and in an already anxious patient they will, of course, and especially since they are new and different, cause new anxiety and/or panic. They needn't, but this is the nature of the combination of these things and anxiety: Each makes the other worse.  The obvious solution is to break the cycle. These things do go away on their own, sometimes quite quickly, but the more adrenaline released due to anxiety caused by the new and therefore frightening arrhythmia, the longer it will last and more often it will recur, til the patient finally \"burns out\" on that symptom, at which time it tends to pretty much go away.  Your heart has simply added something to its repertoire. It will no doubt recycle all these annoying things during times of stress, and whatever causes the greatest anxiety will, by definition, repeat itself til it no longer gets the reaction.   The good news is you've pretty well exhausted the possibilities now. The bad news is: Breaking the anxiety cycle is easier said than done.   That is what it is, though, and knowing this is not dangerous is an important tool in disabling it.   If all else fails, given you have established anxiety and panic disorder issues, there is another route to go aside from beta blocker drugs and anti-anxiety meds: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a self-limited, interactive form of psychotherapy involving literal homework, and not an open-ended type of \"talk\" therapy. It is aimed at modifying the patient's reaction to certain stressors and can be very effective.   Reassurance sometimes can work as well, however, and that's what I'm offering you here: reassurace. You are having very common, even \"normal\" events happen, but anxiety distorts the perception of them as well as the frequency. For some people knowing this is enough. It is the least the medical professional can do, to offer a comprehensive explanation of what's going on. Telling you you're healthy would seem, to a doctor, to make perfect sense, but not if there's no explanation as to why you don't feel healthy. I hope I've at least achieved that with you.  Good luck to you and please do follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your very thorough and thoughtful reply.  I am feeling somewhat reassured, but thought patterns are difficult to change!  I just wanted to clarify that during the runs of palpitations, I don't feel so much of a pounding as a flutter or flip-flopping with each beat, sometimes quite light, that feels exactly like PVC/PAC.  Could this really be nothing but an escape rythym as you described?  I don't know if it feels like bigemy as each beat feels like a regular rythym and the same.  I guess I am having a hard time believing that something that feels so weird and scary could be harmless.  I got such mixed info from my doctor.  Like sometimes he said that we should try and catch my new palpitations on a monitor, but then when it got down to it he said not to worry about it if I wasn't passing out.  I wish that he had been able to say that no matter what sensations I was having in my chest, they are all harmless.  I am still concerned that I might be having or might have in the future, v-tach, which is what really frightens me.  What would a long run of PVC's (v-tach) feel like?  And how would I know if palpitations I was feeling were something to worry about?  I know you said they were all benign, but I need to be hit over the head one more time...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again.  I have done some (internet) research on the rhythms you mentioned, esp. AIVR, which the internet said was rare in healthy patients and mostly found in people with heart disease.  So now I'm wondering, could I have heart disease?  My last tests were 18 months ago...maybe I have peripartum cardiomyopathy?  Is this possible?    I also want to clarify, is AIVR just a run of pvc's at a slow rate and ventricular tachycardia a run of pvc's at a fast rate?  And how do we know what is what and when to worry?  That is my main question.  If I'm having a lot of fluttering do I just assume, without symptoms like fainting, that I am fine?  Or does the duration matter?  Like last week I was lying in bed on my left side and felt 4 flutters in a row fairly quickly followed by a couple regular beats, then several more flutters in a row.  I jumped up to get ready to go to the hospital, but no more came so I went back to bed.  Now I am very worried that it will happen again.  But my old doctor said that as long as all I was feeling was palpitations then there wasn't anything to worry about.  But what if I'm having v-tach?  Shouldn't I worry about that?  Or will I pass out or have other symptoms if I have a long enough run to be worrisome?  And how rare is long runs of dangerous rhythyms in normal hearts?  Is v-tach dangerous in normal hearts?    Also I saw that AIVR could be caused by an imbalance betw. the sympathetic and parasympathic nervous system.  My anxiety does seem to be triggered easily.  Maybe something else is wrong with me?  Why can't I believe your reply that I am fine?  Can you put my mind at ease that I'm not going to have any sustained dangerous rhythyms?  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Maxjax, I have been getting palpitaions and fast heart beat up to 140bpm, very similar to your situation, I have anxiety panic disorder.  I have been having these heart issues for over 3 years, but worse in the last year half, I get the same responses from my doctor, \"don't worry about it, take a valium\".  But I feel that this heart problem is just being brushed under the carpet amd that my doctor just thinks it due to anxiety. I don't like taking the Valium and only take 2 mg or less, it doesn't bring my heart rate down.  I know when I am anxious. Now alot of these heart palpitaions followed by pounding racing heart that lasts for hours happen when I am watching tv , or checking my email, stuff like that, they have even happend while I am asleep and wake me up , I am resting, and I am not stressed or anxious. Then the days after my heart rate is just high all day sitting around 80-100.  The times when I am anxious and stressesd the palpitaions seem different and don't last as long. I also get fast heart rate when I stand up and move around, and when I go to have a shower.  I get dizzyness and some chest pain shoulder pain and a feeling like I can't swallow.  I have had 12 lead ecg that have shown t wave inversion or flat t wave or something like that and also picked up Tachycardia.  My doctor has put me on Atenolol, then she told me to stop .so I did and my heart rate went back up again, then I ended up in the hospital with heart rate up to 144, but when the ambulance got me to hospital , the hospital ecg came up normal but with heart rate at 100 and occasional s2 split ( What does this mean) and they sent me home with letter to give to my doctor, but the ambulance one was different showing t wave issue, and they said it needs to be looked at. So worrying as I worry I may have a heart attack.  I am back on the Atenolol, and my doctor has booked me in for a stress test , but the wait could be up to month or longer, and I am worried something bad could happen.  I wonder if the t wave issue is because of the atenolol ( beta blocker), I am worried all the time now after the last event as my heart hasn't gone that high before, it usually goes as high as 120 resting with palpitations...worried :(\n\n",

    "title": "Re: ectopic beat and IST",
    "content": "Hello -- IST in itself is completely benign but often may have an undiscovered underlying cause (often metabolic, more often due to a flaw in the functioning of the autonomic nervous system). Many people are made very anxious and distracted by the relatively trivial symptoms, because they are so very subjective. In fact this won't lead to cardiomyopathy, and many people have a normal resting rate that runs between 80 or 90 and 110. Many of these also have frequent (or intermittent) premature beats, mostly PVCs, as the parasympathetic side of the system (vagus nerve) attempts to slow the heart rate according to circadian rhythms, relaxation response, digestion, etc. This is also normal and benign, even though it can feel terrible and be very disruptive and productive of a great deal of anxiety. Some people develop such levels of anxiety due to this that they achieve a chronic state of anxiety and this of course only serves to maintain an increased resting heart rate and produces more palpitations. Again it is benign, but the anxiety is far worse than the physical symptoms and often the two become conflated. For certain patients the best approach is to treat the symptoms to restore some feeling of security and calm, and the most effective way to achieve this is by use of lowest-possible dose of a beta blocker, the best probably being metaprolol (brand name Toprol XL). This is not a \"cure\" but can slow the resting rate, reduce the frequency and perception of PVCs and PACs, and actually have a calming effect due to blocking of uptake of adrenaline. If all attempts at psychosomatic correction (reassurance, relaxation exercises, cognitive behavioral therapy) fail this is sometimes a viable way to manage the symptoms and attendant anxiety, but as always it's better to avoid medicating if there is a way to eliminate the problem without meds.   I hope this is helpful to you. Your problem is extremely common, especially among young women and also among med students. Often it can be managed by reassurance, adaptation and the knowlege it is harmless, but it is essential medical providers offer reassurance along with simply telling the patient there's nothing seriously wrong. I hope I've helped accomplish that for you here. Please follow up with us as needed. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

Echocardiogram came out normal but the treadmill stress test did it. My heart just goes too fast with little exertion and while resting.

I would like to exhaust all possibilities before I settle for medicine for the rest of my life or an ablation. What I also noticed within these past two days is that for many years I have had this habit of sucking in my stomach, like the exercise they call \"vacuum\" where you suck in your abs. I have done it for so long that now it is only natural for me to breathe in and out with my abs sucked in but I noticed that when I let my stomach sit naturally (let it stick out) it is harder for me to breathe but my heart rate is slower. I want to get a sleep apnea study as well because friends and family have told me my snoring is really loud, scary loud.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: What causes low heart rate and how serious is it",
    "content": "Hello -- There are two totally different things which could cause what you describe as having happened to your husband; one is not very troublesome. The other might be. Both are worth a visit to the doctor's office (preferably a cardiologist) to see which is happening (or if it's something else).   People frequently have premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), heartbeats that are triggered from some location other than the normal sinus node. These can sometimes (especially at slower rates, such as your husband's, which at 60 is really fine) begin to happen as every other beat, alternating with normal sinus beats. Since the happen early they are weak and if you're using a blood pressure cuff with pulse monitor to track his heart rate (as well as blood pressure) what happens in many instances is these every-other-beat-as-PVC rhythms (called bigemeny) will show up effectively halving the actual rate because the premature beats are a litle weaker and the cuff can't feel them. This tends to make it appear the pulse is slowed to 1/2 it's sinus rate. At these times even feeling the pulse at the wrist or carotid artery in the neck may only yield half the palpable beats. There are actually the correct number, but you can only feel the sinus ones. This can cause lightheadedness if it is sustained for a long period of time.  By the same toke some people sometimes develop what's called a 2:1 heart block, usually in the atrioventricular (AV) node, a nerve center in the middle of the heart that helps convey the sinus beats from the upper chambers to the lower ones. If the AV node becomes diseased it can begin to show intermittent 2:1 blocking, in which every other beat is essentially blocked from reaching the ventricles. The result is more often lightheadedness because the effective rate truly is cut in half. It's impossible to tell which is happening without an EKG or perhaps a portable Holter monitor to record these events. While ventricular bigemeny (the alternating premature beats) can cause symptoms and sometimes requires treatment (medication), it's usually not too much of a concern. An AV block is another story and may or may not require treatment or even possibly insertion of a pacemaker to make sure the heart beats at an appropriate rate.   It would be very important for your husband to have this evaluated to see what's going on. I suspect it to be bigemeny (the less serious problem) because the blood pressure seems to hold up well during these episodes, whereas it usually would drop more during periods of block, but there's only one way to be sure and to have the correct treatment (or just advice), and that's to have it looked at by a cardiologist. I would strongly recommend this be done promptly to avoid problems.   Good luck to you both. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

The average heart rate was 74BPM. The minimum heart rate was 42BPM occurring at 8:20:38 AM. The patient's rhythm included 1hr *min of bradycardia. The slowest single episode of bradycardia occurred at 8:20:11AM D1, lasting 1min 25 sec with rate of 42BPM. The maximum heart rate was 117 BPM, occurring at 6:30:02PM. The fastest single episode of tachycardia occurred at 6:29:56PM D!, lasting 26 sec with rate of 117 BPM. The longest R-R interval was 1.6 seconds occurring at 4:34:44 AM D1. The longest N-N interval was 1.6 seconds occurring at 6:17:25 AM D1.  Ventricular ectopic activity consisted of 4719 beats, of which,21 were triplets, 102 were in couplets, 877 were single PVCs, 3065 were interpolated PVCs, 3 were in R on T, 49 were single VEs, 497 were bigeminy, 105 were trigeminy.  Supraventricular ectopic activity consisted of 15 beats, of which, 3 were in 1 run, 12 were single PACs. The supraventricular run occurred at 2:21;05 pm D1, consisting of 3 beats with maximum heart rate of 95 BPM.\n\n",

    "content": "First of all you're very welcome and thanks for the kind words about the site. It's why we're here and we do our best.  As for the Holter monitor findings, this is not of terribly great concern, but should be evaluated properly by a cardiologist when practical. It sounds as though everything I suggested plus a few other things have been going on, all of which, in the absence of proven heart disease, would be suggestive of nothing except perhaps a very irritable heart muscle. This could be due to anything from a natural propensity to too much caffeine to perhaps some minor structural abnormality. There was no mention of prolonged Q-T interval and nothing else to suggest a seriously worrisome problem. There were a lot of PVCs, which is not at all unusual in a given individual, and oddly enough the majority (a good 3/4) were interpolated PVCs, which means simply they occurred directly between two regular sinus beats without displacing one of them. This can effectively double the heart rate while it's happening, which could make it difficult to tell the difference between an actual rate increase and a perceived one. The lowest rate was above 40, early in the morning, and the fastest, 117, would barely be considered rapid. Both are within the range normally seen in many normal, healthy people. There were a number of triplets and couplets, which is worth a second look by a cardiologist, but not truly noteworthy. The rest all falls within what one might see in a random sampling of healthy people.   Since this exam was ordered by a GP I think it deserves the attention of an actual cardiologist -- and now the work's been done so it shouldn't be too much to ask for one to just look at the result. While I doubt there is anything else remarkble to be seen that wouldn't have been noted in the report, it would be prudent to have this done and possibly followed up with an echocardiogram to determine if there might be a prolapse of the mitral valve leafets (not serious but something worth knowing) or any other structural abnormality. If there is nothing else found, this can then be considered \"normal\" for your husband. The main reason for the followup would be to determine if any of this might suggest a cause of lightheadedness, with special attention paid to the Q-T interval. If that's normal then there's probably nothing further needs to be done.  Good luck to you both again, and please do keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi my name is Nicole Pacinello and I'm 21. I have been wearing an event monitor for the past week or so because of random episodes of a racing heart that i tend to get. I was diagnosed with mild mitral valve prolapse in December. On Sunday I had an episode where my heart rate went up to 141, which the doctor later told me was just sinus tachycardia, so not very concerning. Then a few hours later(on the same day) I had a run of four PVC's in a row, which made him recommend a visit to an EP. I'm currently taking 37.5 mg of Toprol and have eliminated caffeine and reduced my refined sugar intake. My questions are 1) Shouldn't a beta blocker prevent those multiple PVC runs? 2) Can anxiety and stress cause multiple PVC's? 3) Is my heart considered structurally normal, with mild mitral valve prolapse (without regurgitation)?  Thank you so much for your time!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Multiple PVC's and sinus tachycardia",
    "content": "Hi Nicole --  You have some  very legitimate questions. I'll try to answer them in a helpful way. First, \"mild\" MVP is a pretty relative finding. Some doctors won't even call it that, especially if there's no regurge. MVP is, as I'm sure you know, almost always benign, but is often associated with more than average palpitations (PVCs, runs of fast heartbeats, etc) and anxiety and panic disorder. Why this is so is unclear, but it's very obvious it follows in a great many cases.   A beta blocker is the only safe and effective way of reducing PVCs, PACs, PJCs, sinus tach, and various tachyarrhythmias. It won't wipe them out, but it should reduce the frequency and forcefulness of them. By the way, I'm curious how you're winding up with a dosage of 37.5 mg Toprol. I've put together different combinations and haven't been able to get that number. Is  there a 75 mg tab you can break in half? I know it comces in 25, 50 and 100. I'm just curious,  as 50 would seem to be close enough and  less confusing. At any rate, this should  be helping, and if it's not the dose may need to be upped a little. As for multiple PVCs (runs) they happen. There has been over-emphasis placed on this as constituting V-tach, which is only a very technical and arbitrary \"rule.\" Many people have runs of 3 or 4 or more, and in an otherwise healthy heart this doesn't generally present a problem. Oh,  and if you have \"mild\" MVP or any MVP without regurge (or even with trivial regurge) you are still considered to have a structurally normal heart. Only a thickened or dilated (and failing) left vantricle or grossly abnormal valves or other really unusual abnornalities count, but mostly that left ventricular function. And since you've seen an EP, although you have a family history of WPW, you clearly have had that ruled out. That's all to the good (and for some reason these abnormalities are often seen in rather random distribution in families). You're in good shape, but those runs and tachy episodes are going to be disturbing.  The Toprol may need to be upped to get it to where it's not driving you crazy. Sometimes clonazepam (Klonopin) is added to help reduce the trigger of anxiety. It works well with Toprol, but a lot of doctors will shy away from it, so there's about a 50/50 chance it won't be prescribed. Toprol should be adquate in most cases, assuming the dosage is effective. Again, I can'tfigure out how you're getting 37.5 mg. Would love to know how that works.   Otherwise I think you're in good shape, but could use some medication fine tuning. I hope this is helpful, and please do follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for such an informative reply! You really helped me understand what is going on and I'm less worried now. The 37.5 mg comes from one 25 mg tablet in the morning and half a 25mg at night. They are scored so I break them in half. This was the first recommendation from my doctor I got instead of immediately going to 50mg, just to transition my body I guess. Its good to know everything is structurally normal, and 145bpm is really uncomfortable but obviously not dangerous, since the episodes now last less than a half hour. Thanks again.\n\n",

    "title": "Anxiety and PACs - heart disease?",
    "content": "Hello, from far north :)  My history is about as follows: Discovered some premature beats about half a year ago, after a hard day at work with lots of stress. Disappeared after a couple of hours, but kept coming back. Because of this, i visited a doctor and was put on ECG - which was fine. No premature beats.  I wasn't completely relaxed, and requested a Holter, a stress ECG and eccocardiography, which was conducted in august, september and november.  Holter results (and resting ECG with cardiologist: Average HR 75 (Holter) some PACs, low number (not sure how many), most of them during exercise. No PVCs. Resting ECG: QTc 400ms, QRS 105 ms, HR 72. Normal PR-time, everything else OK.  I continued to get PACs during exercise (probably caused by anxiety and adrenaline). My stress ECG results: No arrythmia, 225w work load, O2 99%, BP at rest 115/70, BP at max load 210/90, max heartrate 200, no dizziness, no ST changes, only 1 PAC at rest after stress test, at HR 120.   Ecco: All results normal, was extremely scared at the ECG before ecco, HR 110, sinus tachycardia, QTc 438 ms!! I know that Bazetts formula is inaccurate at high HR, but it still scared me. The T-waves seems normal, but I'm afraid of LQTS / Torsades. After ECG my BP was 145/85, HR 130 during ecco. Immediate drop to 80 when cardiologist told me everything was fine. No PACs/PVCs during ecco.  Afterwards the cardiologist told me that PVCs (?) was completely normal and it was nothing to worry about. I haven't found a single PVC on any test, and I don't understand why this suddenly is PVC's? Is PVCs worse than PACs (I worry about R on T PVC, etc.) Do this exist in healthy hearts?  Anyway, the premature beats during exercise are more or less gone. My cholesterol is fine. I feel 2-10 premature beats during a day, and probably 15-20 before sleep. I feel this as a \"long\" heartbeat, a short break and a hard beat. Sometimes i get palpitations, regular, hard and fast HR. I still feel anxiety. Everyone tell me this is normal and nothing to worry about, but why have they appeared? And how do I make them go away? Can they be caused by some underlying heart disease that is not found yet? Can PACs cause supraventricular tachycardy? Can PVCs cause V-tach?  27y, non smoker, regular exercise, some chest pain but I believe this is muscular. Is all this just caused by anxiety?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Anxiety and PACs - heart disease?",
    "content": "Hi there -- You've come away with a remarkably nice comprehensive cardiological workup result! The only thing it showed up was some anxiety during part of the exam, but that's not unusual, and since you're fairly knowlegeable about certain parts of this process (but not others) it would suggest a somatic obsessiveness associated with some mild anxiety. Hopefully the totally negative exam and tests and what I will tell you here will help alleviate the rest of that.  First: Premature atrial and ventricular beats (PACs and PVCs) are extremely common in the healthy population as well as those with heart disease. They are neither diagnostic nor prognostic of anything. We now know even the R-on-T phenomenon (which you really ought not know about at all, but since you do, we'll take that into consideration) is no more dangerous than no R-on-T. In other words, in the critical care setting post MI (I'm going to assume you've done enough research to understand these terms) half the patients who suffered a dangerous arrhythmia did not have R-on-T beforehand, and half who did had no lethal arrhythmias as a result,rendering this phenomenon virtually useless -- but something that is routinely charted when the patient has had a heart attack. Other PVCs and PVCs have no intrinsic meaning, even though they can occur in the setting of various types of heart disease, because they also happen in nearly all healthy people to a greater or lesser extent.  Your initial Holter results were beautiful.   Without being monitored it is impossible to be certain whether a flip in the chest is caused by a PVC or PAC, and it doesn't really matter. PVCs are somewhat more common, but some have more of on, some of the other. Many have both. Most doctors see mostly PVCs. The fact you've only showed up PACs is statistically interesting but absolutely meaningless.  The QTC was on the far side of normal, but of course it was still normal, it varies under varying conditions and, as you've pointed out (and again, really shouldn't know this) Bazett's formula becomes less and less reliable (or the long side) with increased rate. The fact remains it was within normal limits (WNL) anyway. There is a line for a reason.  Anyone might reasonably be \"afraid of LQTS/torsades\" if one had either of these things, but you don't, so no need to worry or even think about them. Easier said than done, of course, once the genie is out of the bottle. Your alternative would be to go into the medical field, perhaps as a paramedic or cardiology tech, since you've already got some useful knowlege in this area. No, I'm perfectly serious. It's something to think about.  At 2-10 premature beats per day (atrial or ventricular) you're probably way below the average. I personally had a Holter done once (for research purposes) and turned up over 2700 PVCs. It was just one of those days!   You've asked if PVCs or PACs are worse. Neither is \"worse\" than the other, and neither is dangerous nor significant. The R-on-T issue is almost always discovered by lay people out of context, which is the danger of reading up on this stuff. PVCs don't \"cause\" V-tach, but V-tach, since it is a run of consecutive PVCs, begins with one. This is a technicality of language only. They don't cause V-tach. And even runs (\"triplets\" or longer), though still considered V-tach by some clinicians, are almost always meaningless too. In fact the only time ventricular arrhythmias are of concern is when they occur in the setting of a damaged (dilated, scarred) left ventricle with a low ejection fraction. These people are already unwell, so are already being treated for congestive heart failure. They are manifestly unwell.  You also ask why these premature beats have appeared. This is one of those questions that can only be answered with a non-sequitur, because like allergic reactions, \"I never had this before\" answered by \"Well you do now.\" They don't happen (or are not noticed) til they do. You've probably had them before but for some reason are more aware of them now, and this is sometimes solely due to the timing of the premature beats, which can make them far more noticeable depending upon whether or not the tricuspid valve happens to be closed when one fires off.   I hope I've reassured you with all this. While I always encourage patients to be their own advocates and realize it helps if the patient can be somewhat knowlegeable about their complaint in order to describe it well, sometimes a little knowlege can be a dangerous thing, especially in medicine and without the proper context. Again, since you have a proclivity for this stuff, you might want to consider making it a career. It's often true that nursing or tech work takes the anxious person's attention aay from himself and places it where it can do far more good. Just a thought. There's an awful lot more to learn , but you'd at least have a leg up in the cardiology part.   Otherwise I find nothing remarkable in your data at all. You're in great shape with perhaps a little anxiety to work through. I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please do follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Good morning, and thanks for a very good answer.  I realize that my knowledge about heart diseases is too high for a \"non-medic\" to handle. My diagnosis from cardiologist is strong cardiac neurosis, and \"innocent / benign premature contractions\". I strongly believe that, if I would just accept the first explaination (you don't have a heart disease) without reading articles from cardiology journals, this would have been easier.  It's interesting what you say about making medicine a career. This was actually my first plan, but my grades was a bit too low. Instead, I got a masters degree in business and administration, I guess I could start studying medicine now, but it's not easy to combine medicine with economics. One of the degrees would then be a waste. But my family strongly suggest me to be a doctor.. maybe you are right.  I don't consider myself to be a hypochondriac. I'm not worried about cancer, or other diseases, except heart disease. But I guess the cardiac neurosis diagnosis is correct.  I got a note with the results from echocardiography, which was no valve diseases, no hypertrophy, no shunting, left ventricle ejection fraction 55-60%, normal size heart, ventricles and atrias, no signs of myocarditis or pericarditis, no arrythmia during the test. Aorta abdominalis 17mm. ECG results: All normal except sinus tach.  From this, I have a couple of questions (that are probably stupid and a consequence of anxiety and too much reading). I had a HR of 130 and palpitations during the test, would that overestimate my EF (that in my opinion is a bit low) caused to hard beats?     The reason I ask, is when I'm relaxed (and have a HR 50-55, this is typically after exercise when I guess I get rid of some adrenaline and stress, my resting HR is usually higher) I sometimes feel I don't get enough air. This is probably caused by anxiety and hyperventilation, but (of course) I get afraid of beginning heart failure and that my EF when resting if lower.  I also have a follow-up question about the relationship between PAC's and SVT (see, I get better, I don't ask about PVC's and V-tach anymore). Can PAC's cause SVT in a healthy heart (is it the PACs that trigger SVT?). A couple of days ago, I had problems sleeping, got anxious and felt a lot of premature beats. Suddenly, my HR increased to 120, with very \"light\" pulse. When breathing in, the HR was even higher and lighter (and reversed when breathing out). My HR slowly decreased, and in about 15-20 minutes, it was normal. I guess sinus arrythmia and slow HR recovery is contraindications to SVT, but can it still be SVT? Does SVT cause fainting?  Thanks again for a very good answer, you're doing a great job!\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome.   I've noticed over the years that some of the best doctors, nurses and techs have just a suggestion of OCD, and also personally believe \"cardiac neurosis\" may be a manifestation of OCD. Just my idea, but the point is I also feel this, pointed in the right direction, can sometimes make for a really good MD, nurse or tech, especially in the area of cardiology. It also draws their attention from themselves to the people for which they're caring, which is a win-win. Was just a thought, but I'm interested you'd already considered this. Also you don't sound especially hypochondriacal in general (it is a much misunderstood problem).   Your echo results could hardly have been better! Congratulations on that.   I'll try to answer your new questions now, and remember, the only stupid question is one you decide not to ask.   The increase in resting heart rate (and cardiac output, as is likely a result of some anxiety) can affect one's EF to a small extent, not enough to matter, though. What needs to be kept in mind is that all signs and measurements for the most part vary from moment to moment (BP will vary, heart rate, EF, all that stuff) depending on the time of day, activity, caffeine/no caffeine, etc. We do try to narrow the variables as much as possible (which is why certain drugs, foods, caffeine, etc., are curtailed for 12 hours or more before testing). Being WNL is the goal. There are some variations which are so regular as to draw attention, but usually even these don't have any useful meaning. We're not operating by a CPU, so speed or strength of various measurements will vary quite a lot during a day.  The sensation of not getting enough air is classic for the anxious patient and hyperventilation, which can be done totally unwittingly (and usually is) just makes that sensation all the more pronounced. The brain thinks it doesn't need any more air, so the whole process feels funny at those times.   EF will vary some, but as long as it's between 50-70 on any given day it's considered WNL and just fine. It won't drop below its own threshold without a disease process, and if there's a disease process it can't up itself enough to accomodate more than a limited amount of exertion. It's a pretty trusworthy thing to go by. You're good in that department.  While SVT is generally less of a concern -- isn't life threatening so much as annoying -- it, like V-tach, will usually begin with a PAC, but for precisely the same reason, because the whole episode is really al PACs. The question of triggering is actually more difficult to answer for SVT because there are a lot of different mechanisms that can cause it. It can also be \"lone\" and spontaneous. These episodes are usually brief and there's no apparent reason for them. It can be difficult, outside the monitored seting, to tell the difference between a \"slow\" SVT and simple sinus tach. When the rate gets up over 200 BPM, though, you can be pretty sure that's what it is. That's not what's happening with you, and sinus tach can easily get into the 130s. Again, kind of a moot issue. The fact your rate normalizes slowly rules out SVT, though, because it flips on and off like a switch, doesn't start and end gradually.   Good to hear from you again, and hope this clears up the majority of your misgivings. A little reassurance can go a long way sometimes.\n\n",

    "content": "Good morning and thanks for your reply.  I read your answer last night (this is GMT +1) and I had, for the first time in a while, no problems sleeping, and woke up completely rested today. It was an amazing experience, and I thank you for that.  Anyway, I know my problems are not completely solved yet, and I have a long way to go considering \"thinking right\". It's interesting how you consider \"cardiac neurosis\" (I'm not sure if this is the right expression, directly translated from norwegian, the word is \"heart neurosis\", but I believe this is the same) in fact an OCD (like those people who never trust they locked the door or switched of the oven). But you may be right. Before sleeping last night, I tried to focus on my right toe instead of my heart. And it actually worked quite well, I noticed no palpitations or premature beats.  It's also remarkable how norwegian doctors (and GP's especially) considers PVC's more dangerous than US cardiologists do. My GP says that \"PVC's are rarely seen in healthy hearts, it's something we usually see in patients with MI or heart failure\"   Further, I belive that many of my worries is caused by the fact that my dad had a CABG 3 months ago. He recovered remarkably well, but the problem was that he suspected CAD 10 years before the surgery, and no doctor believed him. One day he was considered completely healthy, the next day he was on CABG.  Anyway, thanks for your extremely quick and qualified replies, these services cost about $35 in Norway and haven't helped me much in the past.\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry to bother you again, but something new came up, it seems my Holter actually wasn't so beautiful.  I went to a doctor to learn more about how to treat cardiac neurosis and anxiety. He wanted to go through the Holter results again, and found the analysis results.  I didn't want to see them, because one of my strategies now is to trust doctors and read as little as possible. Anyway, when he found the stack of papers and asked if I wanted to see them - it's a little like watching scary movie scenes - you don't want to look, but you do it anyway.  Well, I had 15 PAC's, less than I expected. They came mostly during activity, as I noticed. Nothing wrong here. But, I found some strange results while sleeping, from 4AM to 6AM, my HR was in range 38(!!) to 90. Rest of the night from 42-95. Is it normal with so high HR variance at night? Is so severe bradycardia normal at night? No one told this to me..  I also found 50 PVC's - most of them at night. No one have ever mentioned PVC's on Holter to me, it's not noted in my journals, or in report to my GP. The doctor said \"this must be wrong\", and even better \"if this was right, it would be dangerous, and your Holter would not be considered normal\" (not helping....)  Is it possible that my cardiologist was lying to me, to make me feel better?  Anyway, I was told by the doctor to forget heart diseases, and to tell the truth, I didn't see any PVC's (bizarre and wide QRS complexes) on the Holter prints, and neither did the doctor. You have told me that 50 PVC's is well WNL, and I guess thats OK, it's more the bradycardia (and high HR) that scared me. Is this possibly a sick sinus syndrome? And what maybe scared me most, is my cardiologist actually lying to me, or can Holter computers generate several analysis errors?\n\n",

    "content": "Cardiac neurosis is a term I prefer not to use, but is fairly accurate sometimes in describing what develops either as a result of self-monitoring or over-acute awareness of somatic (bodily) behavior. This matches, in terms of anxiety, a variant of OCD, although there are certainly those who would argue it's an incorrect application of the term. I'll stand by that analysis, however.   That said, there is that interesting Holter monitor development. First, as to the cardiologist \"lying\" to you, what I would prefer to call this, if in fact it happened (and we can't be certain, can we?) would be selectively informing the patient. I don't think it's a good idea in most cases, but I'm not a doctor; I'm definitely not your particular doctor. I won't second guess him on this matter. However, what showed up on the Holter monitor, the few PACs and 50 PVCs, is definitely unremarkable and not at all dangerous nor any cause for concern. Stating this \"cannot be right\" and \"if it were right it would be dangerous\" is definitely not helpful. It also makes no sense. At this point I begin to wonder about the doctor. There is nothing in what you've relayed that would be considered dangerous. I wouldn't use the term \"lying\" but might at this point substitute \"confused.\"   As to the variance in rate while sleeping, it's not as dramatic as it may appear, but is somewhat unusual, especially the low of 38 BPM. This is not surprising, actually. Neither is the high of 95. What is slightly unusual is seeing that large a difference in one patient. Were it sick sinus syndrome (SSS) however, there would be more sinus pauses, even more rapid heart rate (actual tachycardia, which would run at least into the 140s) and likely atrial fibrillation as well. If this only took place during sleep it wouldn't even remotely suggest SSS, but rather just a very broad example of the normal variance occurring during a sleep cycle. So again, not especially remarkable. The PVCs likely occurred during slower periods and the PACs probably during faster ones. This would correspond to various parts of the sleep cycle, dreaming, etc. and is a normal \"tidal\" effect. Some people may not go quite as low or as high, but they will get down into the 40s and up near 90 routinely, so you're only a little bit outside what is quite common.   I do hope this is helpful. I like your idea of trusting the doctors and trying not to infer things from the reports. However, I am also wondering about this particular doctor and what he means by certain things said and unsaid.  Good luck to you. I think you're in good shape. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I went to see an internist regarding this problem.  He went through the Holter test, (this time, I stayed away from the papers), and results as follows:  Low HR: Sinus bradycardia, and completely normal (according to him) No signs of Sick Sinus Syndrome No AV block The PVCs were single and unifocal according to test summary (not that he saw them, and my cardiologist said they didn't exist) Single PACs  Like you all have suggested, this is a mental problem, and not a heart disease.  It was quite interesting that he answered 15 of my questions with \"this is an irrelevant question\" or \"you can't stop having wrong focus\".   I guess you all are right. I need to learn that a PAC or PVC is not more dangerous than an ordinary heart beat. I know it's not an easy process, and I still have problems sleeping (I sometimes feel that my heart and body is stopping before sleep), of course this is only my imagination. I get scared, and this is causing my \"SVT runs\" (that are not SVT runs) described earlier.  I know that it's not SVT, simply because I can feel a couple of premature beats during the runs. And this is impossible during an ectopic tachycardia, I believe.  My internist gave me a specific order, quit reading medical topics unless I wanted to be a MD. I guess that is right, too.   Thanks for your help, you have great knowledge about cardiology topics and mental health.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, and happy new year.  I'm definitely feeling better now, but I have three questions (that are really not bothering me as much as before). I believe I have to \"learn to live my life\" again, and learn that benign symptoms in fact are completely benign, if that made any sense.  My first question: Sometimes when I feel my heart beats without checking pulse (feeling heart beats in fingers, head, etc.) they sometimes tend to skip one or a couple of beats. Not the feeling of premature beats with the following hard beat. Im not sure if this is real, though, maybe the pulse is just lighter for a couple of beats, during breath or something, and I never sense it when I'm actually checking the pulse (which I usually don't do anymore). If there actually is a skipped beat, can this be some kind of AV block? Do this appear in young otherwise healthy people, and would the symptoms present in this way? And, wouldn't this start with a 1st degree AV block? My PQ time is normal at all ECGs, and no AV block is noted on Holter. Can this phenomena just come and go?  Second questing concerning alcohol: During christmas I met my friends for a couple (or maybe a little bit more) of beers, two times. After I came home, I started to get some kind of tachycardia (HR 110-120). After a couple of hours sleeping, I wake up, and my body was like during exercise. Sweating, heart rate 130-140, sensation of high body temperature. Next morning everything was normal. What is this? Is it the \"holiday heart\" phenomena (AVNRT) or just a physiological reaction to alcohol?  Third question regarding blood pressure. I sometimes get a bit lightheaded when standing up or walking. My physiotherapist says this is tight muscles in neck / shoulders. My BP is at last measure between 115-125 / 70, and my GP says it's the best BP he has ever measured. However, how low BP is considered too low, and can cause dizziness when standing?  And, just a last question: Is it actually possible (without an ECG) to sense the difference between a PAC and a PVC? I must say, its hard to put the Holter PAC/PVC issue completely away. When it's noted in report \"spread single PACs, otherwise normal findings\" this correlates bad with \"15 PACs and 50 PVCs\" (because 50 is more than 15). Is PVCs registered on Holter tests usually PACs with aberrancy in young people?  I remember this part of dialogue with my cardiologist after my holter test:  - You have some premature beats... - OK? I suspected that.. - They origin in the atria.. -  Good, that was a relief.. - But they wouldn't be dangerous even if they origin in the ventricles.. - But they don't? - No.  And..  - How many PACs was registered? - Eh.. I don't remember.. - High number of low number? - Low number.  Like you probably understand, this doesn't make sense to me.  Anyway, thanks for great help, I believe I will handle this after some time. However, as you can see, questions appear sometimes, and with some reassurement, I believe I can get completely well.\n\n",

    "content": "I'll try to answer your questions in order. First, the issue of percieved skipped beats based upon somatic sensation of which the vast majority of people are unaware to begin with: This is not a reliable indicator of what's going on rhythm-wise. Sometimes we feel consecutive pulses in the periphery and sometimes we do not. Much depends upon dilation of capilaries, posture, etc. The loss of a pulsation in the skin or peripheral vasculature not only is not helpful in \"reading\" the pulse, it is utterly unrealiable. Best strategy: try to lose awareness of these pulsations or, at best, come to terms with the fact they are totally unreliable indices.  Second: Holiday Heart is generally applied to episodes of atrial fibrillation resulting from binge drinking occurring only around the holidays. However, less problematic sinus tachycardia can be caused also by even light drinking in some people. It is not \"holiday heart\" as understood, but is a bodily response to alcohol consumption based upon the cause and effect of blood vessel dilation caused by alcohol ingestion. In those so predisposed, there is a tendency to this dilation lasting up to 24 hours, with consequent mild sinus tach to help offset the drop in blood pressure. It generally resolves by morning and is not a medical concern.  Third: Lightheadedness upon rising, standing or rising and walking, especially after prolonged sitting is extremely common and normal. It may be due to tight/tense neck muscles or may just be a slow baroreceptor response. If it becomes disruptive there is the possibility of neurocardiogenic syncope or postural hypotensive tachycardia or POTS, but this is still within relatively normal limits although it can be a minimally disruptive passing phenomenon. Those with POTS learn to adapt to the problem by living and moving at their own pace. However, it is but one end of a spectrum that is generally normal. If it presents a problem in passing, one then must learn to stand and wait a moment before beginning to move about. Otherwise is perfectly normal.  Finally: It is sometimes, but rarely, possible to distinguish between a percieved PVC and PAC. It is generally extremely difficult to near-impossible to tell the difference subjectively. A few overly somaticized patients manage to get it right once in a while, but the exercise itself is pointless. Both are essentially benign anyway. The fact that a doctor may or may not be willing to discuss a Holter report in actual detail is often shrouded by a desire to minimize the interest of the patient in something which is inherently meaningless.   Hope this answers these questions for you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 22 year old female, who is pretty healthy.  I occasionally have SVT episodes, and it is almost always after I have caffeine.   I have drastically cut back caffeine for this reason.  When I have an episode, my chest feels really tight, I feel short of breath and pretty dizzy.  The last few days I have been having the symptoms, and no palpitations. When I take a deep breath, my chest feels uncomfortable and tight, just like it does when I'm having an SVT moment.  I have been having this problem non stop for the last 2 days.  I'm also wondering if it could have something to do with my lifting a very heavy couch with the help of my friend-as it started that night.  If its possible, could I have just pulled a muscle in my chest?  Would that create the tightness when I take a deep breath?  I called my local hospital's \"dial-a-nurse\" and she sounded alarmed, but it could be because she doesn't understand SVT.  She made it sound like I was having a heart attack, and that I should go to the hospital.  I'm 99% positive thats not the case, and going to the hospital isn't an option because I don't have health insurance, nor do I have the out of pocket money that a doctor visit would cost.

    "title": "Re: SVT- chest tightness",
    "content": "Hi there --  First, advice-line nurses are in a difficult position because they are being asked by people \"should I be concerned?\" and all they have to go on is a broad set of guidelines. If one of them makes a mistake it could be a costly one, so they will always err on the side of safety. This is a good thing, but you also have brought your question here, where we can go into a little more detail. First, there's nothing to suggest, per your discription, heart disease. Also, based on your admittedly sparse but good history and symptoms, plus relative youth, there's very little likelihood this is heart related. The symtpoms are similar to part of what you'd feel with SVT, but that's because SVT keeps the heart working hard and everything rather tight during episodes, and muscle pulls and costochondral strain and irritation, especially from heavy lifting, will cause almost identical sensations. One way to determine if this is musculoskeletal would be to press with fingertips moderately firmly on the affected area to see if you can elicit any pain or tenderness. Also, twisting mostion of the upper body or deep breathing will aggravate the symptom of tightness and possibly tenderness. This is never heart-related. I trust you're not having shortness of breath or dizziness with this current similar symptom, although if it seems to inhibit your breathing you may wind up hyperventilating unknowingly, which can create the sensation of shortness of breath.  It is entirely possible you could right now have a pulled chest muscle and the tightness upon deep breathing is caused by that. It is even likely. Bear in mind also that while this feels similar to an SVT episode, even those do not usually indicate coronary artery disease, and so are not related as a rule to heart attack. I would never say to someone \"No,  you are not having a heart attack, \" even if the person appeared totally fine, without first doing a few diagnostic tests,  but given the nature of the complaint  and the history and the way we have to work here,  I feel it is very reasonable to say that is extremely unlikely. You very likely are suffering a muscle pull, which can cause sensations very similar to brief SVT or atrial fibrilliation (and some people don't even notice when those happen!). If you are also having shortness of breath and lightheadedness then there may be somethng else going one, but you haven't mentioned those relative to this recent discomfort, so I will assume that hasn't happened and so this becomes almost certainly a muscle pull issue. You still might want to press on your ribs in the affected area and twist your upper body, just to see if you get any tenderness response, which would just confirm the muscle problem.  If you ever have any substantial doubt about what might be going on, do not hesitate to go to the ER. That being said,  at your age and with your history I don't think this is necessary right now. T  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here and keep us updated. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a teaching assistant for a college physio lab and decided to take an ECG for fun during some downtime in lab.  I noticed an arrhythmia (trace from right arm/left leg lead) and a quick Google led me to the PVC wiki entry.    In this case it's asymptomatic.  I've never felt palpatations/skipped beats and never would've known if not for the ECG.  I am in my mid-twenties, overweight, and have high blood pressure - this makes me think that further examination might be a good idea.    My questions are these:  Is it worthwhile to schedule an appointment with a general practitioner or cardiologist? If so, how urgent is this appointment?  I will be traveling for the holidays soon and could have tests done at a lower cost while there.  Thanks in advance for your replies and thanks for putting up with yet another PVC question.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- An appointment based upon a single PVC -- let alone the sometimes hundreds or, yes, thousands found on the 24 hour monitor recordings of perfectly healthy people -- no, it wouldn't be worth the time, expense, trouble, etc., even if there were awareness of occasional premature beats. See, these have no prognostic nor diagnostic usefulness at all, they occur in almost everyone at some time or another, and it was just blind luck one showed up on your very random EKG (I've had this happen while being the \"dummy\" in elecrtocardiography classes and am always amused by the concerns expressed).   That being said, obesity and high blood pressure are very good reasons to at least be followed on a regular basis, to have an exercise and diet regimen prescribed, and possibly to be taking something to help control the elevated BP (depending on just how high it is and how often). These are risk factors that are quantifiable. PVCs are not, really, although they can be recognized and sometimes do serve to bring someone's attention to some other issue (obesity, high blood pressure, for two examples) even though they have no significance of their own.   It may have been fortuitous you did the one-lead EKG, if only to get you in to see a doctor who will help you work on known issues that can be managed now while you're still young and before there is a real problem.   Good luck to you. Follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Elevated heart rates lasting 2-4 hours",
    "content": "Hello, I am looking for some help and advice. (I guess I should give some vitals.. I am 22 turned so a few months ago..  I am 6 feet tall and 180 lbs so not over weight.. I smoked for 1 1/2 years QUIT and will never smoke ever again, I do not drink period - my family says we have no real history of heart disease. or disorders to their knowledge )  For about a year now I get these heart rates which are roughly 160-180 they will last roughly 2-4 hours each time at which point they being to slow back down to a normal resting rate.  I spoke to my doctor about this a year ago and have had a follow up last September and everything seemed ok them. she put me on toprol 25 mg once a day. and then after a few days (she had me phone her with my bp and how my pulse was etc) lowered it to breaking the pill in half and taking it once per day.   I have had moments of this elevated heart rate (they also always seem to accompany or maybe even be caused by panic attacks as I have been diagnosed with Panic disorder and GAD)   If I do not take the beta blocker they will take from my experience before having it 2-4 hours to return to below 100 then normal . If I take the beta blocker durning it usualy within 45-65 minutes my heart rate is back to normal or  atleast at or below 100.   I can tell you that exact timing as I just went through the event. It started at 12:10 am est time - I tried breathing and xanax I had taken 1.5 mg since waking up at 10:30 pm est. But it raced no matter . I knelt down to pick up my stress ball and when I stood back up my heart raced even faster and then it well did its thing started racing.. I no longer check how fast it is as - to be quite frank with you it makes me more anxious. but I can usually tell just by senseing it was roughly 160-180 ish and I took my beta blocker at 12:42 AM est and by 1:35 am EST my heart rate was down to 89 bpm I have not checked it since as I perfer to avoid making myself more anxious. My heart rhythm during these also stays even aside from the occasional 'skipped beat'.   In the past I have had an EKG done and on the check up in sept my doctor did a heart listen? she spent about 5-7 minutes simply listening to my heart beat from the front sides and back. As she also did when I had my EKG done (I had the EKG done before by about maybe 1 month or so these racing issues came about: the EKG was NSR with a slightly elevated rate of 113 my doctor said it was in her opinion white coat syndrome causing the elevation because other wise both doctors on called agreed it looked normal)   My questions are simple but maybe not.  What do you think this could be caused by. I have no way to see a cardiologist at this moment and any advice would be amazingly helpful  What should I do.. is the beta blocker enough.. are these heart rates harmful?  Are there any long term effects to the beta blocker or the heart rates.  Thank you very much I appreciate this\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Elevated heart rates lasting 2-4 hours",
    "content": "Hello Sir Wence -  Your symptoms as described suggest several different possibilities. You have told us you have been diagnosed with panic disorder and GAD, so some cardiac symptoms are not surprising. The problem, as you've already suggested, is that panic attacks can cause rather rapid heart rates, but also rapid heart rates can cause intense anxiety or trigger panic attacks. This is a big problem for clinicians as well as patients.  You've given us one significant bit of information in that you state the rate gets up as high as it does, lasts for several  hours, remains regular during that time, then slowly winds down to the normal range. If you were suffering from supraventricular tachycardia the rate would likely be at least that fast (and probably even more rapid) but would convert abruptly to normal, often with a long sinus pause at the end of the episode.   So it's not SVT, and since it's regular it's not atrial fibrilliation. Since it reaches as high as 180, it's unlikely to be atrial flutter either.  This leaves just two possibilities: one,  that you are having episodes of junctional tachycardia (a non-lethal but pretty annoying arrhythmia) or, more likely,  you are operating on such a high level of adrenaline that your anxiety, when stirred up, causes your heart to speed up to unusually fast sinus tachycardia rates. This is not unheard of, although it  is more common to see sinus tach rates in the 120-140 range. Sinus tach always winds down slowly, as the anxiety (and consequent adrenaline overdrive) subsides.   A beta blocking agent would seem ideal in either case.   You have numerous pluses in your favor, such as having quit smoking young  (and having decided to never start again -- you get big points for that decision); you also have no known heart disease in your family history, which is a very big plus. Other pluses are a normal EKG and an understanding of your anxiety-based problems, which are not something you can just \"get over.\" You might  consider, if you haven't already, looking into cognitive therapy,  a specialized, behavior-modifying type of therapy that is not simple talk therapy and does not run on endlessly. Results with this are often very good with anxiety, although there can be a physical predisposition to panic disorder, so there are limits to what can be accomplished.  Now then, about the Toprol: this is an excellent beta blocker, probably the best all-around for general use. It is very well tolerated, you get good results with a very low dose, and since it is cardioselective (acts mostly just on cardiac beta receptors) it  doesn't have near the side effects of some other beta blockers.  There is no long-term risk nor any danger of unwanted side effects (other than possibly some early feeling of fatigue) with long-term use, so long as it is taken as directed, which is the rule with any prescription drug anyway. The only problem, and you may have actually run into this without realizing it, is that to be effective beta blockers must be taken consistently, at very close to the same time every day. You mustn't stop taking the Toprol without a doctor's direction, and then it should  be tapered off over a period of one to two weeks. Since you sometimes don't take it, you may actually be triggering episodes of anxiety and rapid heart rate. This is a very common side effect from not taking a scheduled dose. It is called a rebound effect, and people with known heart disease can cause life-threatening problems by doing this. In your case this is unlikely, but you may well be triggering the very symptom you want to avoid. Beta blockers are helpful in combating anxiety (although they are not normally prescribed for that alone), since they block the uptake of adrenaline by the heart muscle, and so slow the heart rate and lower the blood  pressure and cardiac output. I would think 25 mg. would be ideal for your situation -- or even 12.5 if it works for you -- but you must take it on a regular basis or else have your doctor taper you off it and try some other approach.  Since Toprol won't cause any harm  and can almost certainly help control your episodes of tachycardia, I would be inclined to suggest you stick with it, but take it on a regular basis. Since it is only once-a-day dosing it isn't too much of a burden.   I think this is probably your best bet for now, to resolve to take the  Toprol on a regular basis, and then look into the possibility of cognitive therapy as a possible  long-term solution to the anxiety problem, which is something you could  certainly do without if possible.  Best of luck to you and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Ah thank you very much for your reply. I hope you had a good 4th of july.  I do take it everyday, however my sleep cycle has become so varied it has become at different times until recently. My sleep cycle has stablized in a .. abnormal time frame.. sleep until 2:30-3:15 pm each day. and I take the 12.5 mg of toprol 2-4 hours after awakening each day. Does that sound a good enough way to be doing it.. I keep track when I take them each day the last 3 days (not counting today)   beta blocker 12.5mg  6:52 pm  beta blocker 12.5mg  7:13 pm  beta blocker 12.5mg  7pm   If that is considered regular enough ( I hope so ) I will be sure to keep it so as I did not know what you pointed out that a rebound could be taking effect.  Also I now take 2.5 mg of xanax per day to help control the anxiety  I saw my PCP/internist on May 28th And she did listen to my heart for about 5 - 10minutes and It was going at a decent clip probably 125bpm she didn't seem concerned nor did she think I required an EKG or Holter Monitor but she did say if I felt either would help to relieve my mind to call her and she would set either up for me. Do you think either would be warranted?   I also now have a therapist whom is trying to teach me many relaxation techniques though Neither of us will deny the slow if any progress. And Anxiety disorders do sadly run in my family on my fathers side.  Also I space out the xanax doses 1mg when I wake up .5mg 1-2 hours laters then 6-8 hours later another .5mg and 4-6 hours another .5mg.  But one thing even before the appointment I keep getting this odd sensation that my heart muscle is 'weakening' or beating that is to say with less all around strength. Now I am will to bet that has more to do with my Anxious perception of what my heart and by proxy of course pulse is doing. But it feeling weak is disconcerting, But I do believe my doctors listening would have picked up on it if it was really weak..   It has been a long process and I assume it will continue to be , but if you could give me your views on any or all of the above I would appreciate it greatly and again thank you for your initial response I found it both helpful and informative.   Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Elevated heart rates lasting 2-4 hours",
    "content": "Hello again -  Thanks for the update. It's helpful for sure. First, as to the regularity of the Toprol dosing, you are more than regular! If you can keep it within a one-hour window you are doing really well. I'd guess you've removed any possibility of any rebound effect. It would take several hours, at least, to notice it anyway, and at the lowest dose (which you are taking) it might be negligible anyway.  Next, your most recent visit to your PCP. While she seems quite comfortable with her assessment of the problem as anxiety-based, I suspect a resting 12-lead EKG would be helpful to your peace of mind and also serve as a useful baseline document. So long as nothing out of the ordinary shows up aside from the mild sinus tachycardia (which is just a little bit unusual), then you could let the issue go, and perhaps relax more, which could only be helpful.  You are using Xanax to its fullest potential by speading it out over three daily doses, but there are a couple of minor problems I see with this, which you might discuss with your PCP next time you meet: one, Xanax, as a short-duration \"rescue\" drug, is not the most appropriate pharmacological approach to this sort of problem -- although it is still the drug of first resort for many physicians who do not specialize in psychopharmacology. Frequent and long-term use has a slight but real risk of dependency, although technically so does any drug which keeps a problem in check without actually curing it. Clonazepam (or Klonopin) can be taken twice a day, which first of all allows for less keeping track, and so less thinking about why you are even taking it; second, its effect is more constant over the 12 hours, so there is a lot less up-and-down than with Xanax, which was intended to abort panic attacks or episodes of acute anxiety but was not designed as a therapeutic approach; finally, there are other approaches which work for many (but not all) anxious patients, such as a number of the SSRI family of anti-depressant drugs, which also have a longer dosing interval, which has the same important advantage of not bringing so much attention to itself. I think Xanax has its place in the battle with anxiety and PD, for instances where the problem breaks through or intensifies on occasion, but something you can take only once or twice a day, such as clonazepam, really does have a symbolic effect as well as a practical one. There is also the matter of less sedative effect, which for some people can be an issue with Xanax (although again, your dose is pretty low).  I do think the EKG being done might have some potential benefit in terms of easing your mind, as also as a proper tool to fully assess your health and a baseline for what's \"normal\" for you and your heart. I do strongly suspect this is entirely an anxiety-based problem, and yes, the perception on your part of your heartbeat's having grown weaker is strictly a subjective one. We can get so tuned into our somatic sensations that we lose all perspective as to what they are tellng us, which is why it's good to have another party check from time to time, preferably your PCP or at least a skilled nurse or technician. If your doctor has listened to your heart with a stethescope then she knows the actual force with which your heart is beating, so you can rest easy about that.   It is difficult to learn to \"forget\" to pay so much attention to your heart's rate, rhythm, force, etc., but since there  is no clinical evidence of any  actual disease, this would be a good goal as well as a good marker that you are becoming less anxious and concerned about your heart's functioning.   Chronic anxiety, as well as panic disorder, can run a long, obstinate course, but with the proper clinical approach it can at least be managed and your quality of life and peace of mind can be much improved.   I hope all this is useful to you, and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  No problem about the name change. I think I followed you OK.   You're being responsible and careful with the Xanax dosing, so that should work out fine for you until or unless the medication is changed to something that lasts longer and requires less mental computation.  As for the Toprol, again, as long as you take it within an hour or two of the 24 hour window of the previous dose, there should be no problem there. It can take up to 12 hours without it for some people to notice something wrong, and at the low dose you're taking you could still take the regular dose even that late, although I would advise against that as a routine practice, and besides, as with the Xanax, you appear to be very careful about the dosing schedule, so you should be fine there. The goal with Toprol, as with any routine maintainance drug, is to get the most steady possible effect. So the closer to regular intervals and daily use, the better. It doesn't matter when you take it, morning or evening, or even mid-day. Just choose a time when you are least likely to find yourself without access to the pill and some water.   Now then, about the 6 vs. 12 lead EKG: while I'm not sure I understand why a doctor would even offer a six-lead EKG, perhaps that is the equipment available to her? To meet the universal standard of diagnostic criteria, a 12-lead is the one used (or in some cases even a 15 lead has been made standard); still, a six-lead EKG, for purposes of diagnosing an arrhythmia or, in your case, a tachyarrhythmia, should be adequate, since the rhythm can be visualized in just one lead, and the additional ones only help to visualize any electrical abnormalities that might explain why it is happening. So a six-lead EKG should be fine for your purposes, if that's all you can get. It's just a little unusual, since now 12-lead EKGs are common even in the field (many EMTs and paramedics now have access to portable 12-lead equipment on ambulances now, where a few years ago they were working with one or two leads at most).   By all means do get back to us after you've had the exam and EKG, and let us know what you learn. In the meanwhile it would seem you're doing everything right, so just keep doing that and try to minimize stress and anxiety as much as you can.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat in 1999. I require no medicine for this diagnosis and have been \"re-examined\" regarding my irregular heartbeat twice  since that original diagnosis just to make sure nothing had changed. Each time it has been determined that my irregular heartbeat is \"regular in its irregularity\" and of no real concern at this time. I notice palpitations whenever I get scared, surprised or am highly anxious about something...but other than that I have gotten used to how it feels and really am rather unaware for the most part.  I recently, however, found out I was pregnant. And I have questions about having an arrythmia and how labor and delivery might affect that. When I research this online all I am able to pull up is that being pregnant can cause temporary arrythmias. But I am wanting to know what kind of affect it has on women who have EXISTING arrythmias prior to pregnancy...and I am having little luck getting that information. I had a child in 2000 with no problems...but he was a c-section because of his size...so there was no stress involved in the delivery.  Also, I would really like to have a natural birth...but didn't know if, with a history of irregular heartbeat, if it would be better to have an epidural to ease the stress of the situation on my body.  Thank you for helping to answer some of my questions. :)\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Arrhythmias and Pregnancy",
    "content": "Hi there -- Well then. First we need to know for certain what your \"regularly irregular\" arrhythmia is. I strongly suspect it is common premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), as this description would apply to that (the premature beat is followed by a compensatory pause exactly long enough so the next regular beat occurs right on time) or ventricular bigemeny (PVCs occuring in group patterns with every other beat in the group a PVC -- also regularly irregular). In either case, if this is the case, these are quite normal and harmless -- almost everyone has some, more or less, and at varying times. They often occur more often in axious people, but in some people they are the cause of anxiety -- which then provokes more of them. They occur more often during stress, during pregnancy, with caffeine intake, smoking, drinking, digestion, growing sleepy, lying on one's left side, or sometimes for no apparent reason.   I do wish your doctor had been more clear about exactly what he terms \"irregular\" heartbeat, and I believe I have guessed correctly, but since he didn't give you a full explanation (as is so often the case) you're left now wondering exactly what implications this may have. If in fact these are common PVCs -- or even PACs (premature atrial contractions, although these are not truly \"regularly irregular\" as a rule) they may become more frequent during advanced stages of pregnancy,but otherwise should have little or no significance. I'd simply like to know, via the doctor's words, whether or not this is in fact the problem -- and if it is it's no problem. Chances are this is the case, but because I don't know this for a fact it would be improper of me to simply assume it to be the case and tell you it's fine, nothing to worry about. This probably is so, but I won't say it unless I know what the actual arrhythmia is. I'd strongly suggest you trouble your doctor for an explanation, as you will be having another baby and while I'd expect a responsible doctor to take this into account, this is something left just kind of hanging. If this were a betting game I'd bet on no problem at all, but it's not, we don't bet on these things, we deal in facts, so the best thing to do would be to ask the doctor directly.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed and good luck to you.\n\n",

They are reluctent to give me a ICD, because they tell me the type of v-tach I go into is not life threatining.I know its weakening my heart and now I have been getting sick(vomiting) with the really long episodes. I am also exhausted most of the time. What else is there?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sustained V-tach",
    "content": "Hello -- I really did some research before I replied to this because it is such a strange and bothersome problem. Doctors sometimes lose sight of the emotional toll a benign problem can take on a person. While this is an almost always benign form of V-tach that acts more like supraventricular tachycardia, the approach to treatment is usually the same. It seems in your case to be a lot more stubborn than most, or there are multiple irritable sites in there. If the first ablation didn't succeed but the next two did, then I have to conclude you have multiple sites or one that's oddly shaped. The most successful approach is ablation so I have to endorse doing it again, even though having this done four times would be a trial for anyone's patience.   What I did learn in my research (and you may be aware of this, but other readers -- and some doctors -- may not be) is the misbehavior of right outflow v-tach is, in women, significantly different in that it seems to be tied to the menstrual cycle, and there are times during the cycle when it is very difficult to induce the arrhythmia, so it's much harder, at those times, to ablate it as well. While the connection between this arrhythmia and fluctuating hormone levels is unclear, it is quite clear there is one, and while only one major study (of which I'm aware) has addressed this (Marchlinski, Deely and Zado, UPA), it is their suggestion menstrual cycle be taken into consideration when planning or attempting EP study and/or ablation, as well as making a list of other apparent triggering factors. Hopefully this latter thing has been done, but it may well be the estrogen/estradiol part had been overlooked due to limited awareness up til recently. It could make a big difference in locating and ablating once and for all the irritable sites. It also is recommended a common beta blocker be tried to help manage the problem. I don't know whether your doctors ever stopped at that early idea or simply plunged straight into the Class III drugs you mention, but those all are equally likely to trigger the arrhythmia as they are to suppress it (with the possible exception of amiodarone), so going back to basics and a simple beta blocker such as metaprolol could possibly slow this. While the extremely high rates you mention resemble more SVT than V-tach, this overall resembles SVT more in terms of symptoms and numbers than it does V-tach,because it originates on the right side of the heart, which is also why it is benign. Further, while sensation and logic would both suggest this would eventually weaken or damage the heart, the science surrounding it says otherwise, that it's unpleasant while it's happening but won't cause physical damage to the heart muscle. It certainly can be exhausting, however, and the episodes are so long as to suggest a possible retrograde conduction pathway which may somehow involve a supraventricular involvement. That's a total shot in the dark on my part, but the rate and duration are just much more like SVT even given the fact Right outflow V-tach acts more like SVT anyway.   The long and short is the ICD would probably do no good and might actually do some harm to the conduction system, whereas ablation still holds the most promise for a cure. I'd also look into the use of simple beta blockers as well.  I hope this is helpful. I realize this is a fairly unusual problem and must be very frustrating for you. Try to hang in there and it's just my opinion but I think this time I'd concur with the EP doctors and go for that additional ablation. It still holds the most promise for making this go away.   Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed, and keep us updated as well.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- The short answer to your short question is No. While those measures can help make you feel better and help your tolerance of the problem and may even reduce the incidents (unless it is chronic and constant), the only way to \"cure\" this is via radio frequency (RF) catheter ablation, and there is a good per centage of cure via this method, which is an in-and-out, same day procedure in almost all cases. Success is about 80% for atrial fib-flutter and even higher for other atrial arrhythmias. If ablation doesn't work there are medications that can sometimes control or at least slow this arrhythmia, but with these one usually must also take an anticoagulant (warfarin, branded Coumadin) to prevent clot formation and avoid possible stroke, the main complication associated with A-fib/flutter.  I hope this helps answer your question. Good luck to you. Follow up with us here if you have further questions or information.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: how will they wean my 1yr old son off flecainide and digoxin",
    "content": "Hello -- The most common causes of this early SVT are either Wolfe-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and atrio-venricular re-entry nodal tachycardia (AVNRT), both of which ultimately can be cured in most instances via catheter ablation. However, if this is the cause the boy is still too young/small to do this, I believe, and the medications he's on are probably not the most efficacious -- a calcium channel blocker (vermapamil) would probably be more effective -- if I am correct in my assumption regarding the underlying cause -- and have less side effects as well as be easier to discontinue when it comes time. As for weaning him off the two current meds, it would seem to me, due to his age and size it would be far wiser to do this weaning process in hospital setting rather than at home. Basically he would be on constant monitoring as the medications were reduced in dosage and watched closely to be certain appropriate medical and pharmaceutical measures were close at hand should the SVT recur. If it were me I would much prefer this arrangement, so hopefully this is what the doctors have in mind. If not, I would argue strongly in favor of it. Hopefully he has outgrown the problem, at least as a refractory arrhythmia. It seems unlikely he would outgrow it altogether and would likely have to be on some far less noxious medication until old enough for the radio frequency (RF) ablation to be done.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Cardioversion For Atrial Fibrillation",
    "content": "I am asking about my husband.  He is 31 years old, smoker, not on any meds.  He went to a cardiologist this week and found out that he has constant atrial fibrillation.  The doctors are suggesting he gets cardioversion done within the next few weeks.  I was very surprised they wanted to do this as a first line of treatment without trying medication or anything first.  My husband believes this came on from being electrocuted when he was 18, and his heart has had a funny rhythm as long as I've known him.  I am just wondering if cardioversion is a normal first line of treatment, or should we seek a second opinion from a heart rhythm specialist?  I am very worried about him, and the thought of shocking his heart is quite frightning.  We don't know much about this procedure, and the doctor did not explain it to us.  From what I've read the longer you've been in AFib, the less successful cardioversion is.  Is that correct?  Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Cardioversion For Atrial Fibrillation",
    "content": "Hello -- Cardioversion is a relatively innocuous procedure that sometimes works (probably 75% of the time) and sometimes has to be repeated or loses its ability to effect change about half the time. Still, for certain selected groups it is very effective and may resolve the problem. It's nothing at all like the defibrillation scenes one sees on television involving patients in cardiac arrest; it's pretty dull, actually. The fact your husband was struck by lightning does make sense as a possible cause of his A-fib, especially since he is so young and otherwise healthy. Whatever the cause, cardioversion is usually the first line of therapy, because treating this with medication, which is the second choice, is far more complex, involving both something to subdue the arrhythmia and often an anticoagulant if the arrhythmia won't completely go away. It can be a nuisance, although this is often necessary.   There is also sometimes the hope of curing the problem permanently with radio frequency (RF) ablation, which usually takes (including prep and recovery time) the better part of a day, but when it works it usually is for good. Some people for various reasons are not considered candidates for this, but it's worth asking about.  The reason cardioversion is especially important in your husband's case is because it is the quickest way to return him to normal sinus rhythm while a long-term management plan is formulated, and can result sometimes in permanent cure. A-fib is, in itself, not life-threatening but, as I'm sure has been explained, the potential complication of stroke is always lurking in the background (clots form in the upper chambers of the heart where the blood isn't moving steadily and forcefully, which allows the clots to form, then eventually be expelled, where they then find their way to the brain). So it's important to restore a regular rhythm and then see if it holds up. If not, medication or ablation are the next steps.  Hope this helps. Good luck to you both and please follow up here with any further questions.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Preexcitation syndrome and short PR in six year old boy",
    "content": "Hello -- There are two or three (the third is extremely rare) syndromes which feature these abnormalities. Some doctors feel there is nothing worrisome about any of these, but one of the three, Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome does have the potential, up to an average age of 35-40, to cause, rarely, dangerous tachyarrhythmias. Generally the most dangerous period is between 12-20 years of age, but whether or not this is the specific syndrome your son has can only be determined by looking at the EKG, which, in the case of WPW, has a very distinctive clue visible. These, I feel, should be corrected as soon in life as practical, by means of radio frequency ablation. I've heard a time or two too often of a doctor having said \"It's nothing to worry about\" when it turned out it was. I see you've included an email address and have scanned the EKGs, so I will contact you via that route and you can send me the scanned EKGs. It should be easy to recognize if your son has the potentially dangerous form or not. This should help clear the air, because if he doesn't then you really don't need to worry, and if he does, it can be resolved permanently by means of a very simple RF ablation. I will be in contact. Meanwhile, because of his relative youth, your son is at statistically lower risk for now, so don't be overly worried. We'll see which of the types of bypass tract he has and I'll advise from there. In the meantime, please follow up with us here if needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 33 year old female. Started smoking when I was 21 and drank quite a bit of alcohol during my 20's. First time quit smoking when I was 30 but then started again and have intermittently quite since but have not smoked at all for the last 2 months. I excercise regularly and have weeks when I don't drink any alcohol and then occasions when I drink every weekend for a few weeks. HAve had quit a bit of stress in my life as have immigrated to another country and all sorts of other stressors.  About a year ago I first started feeling my heart 'skip' a beat or give an extra beat but from what I have read from others it sounds like PVC's. They happened especially just after having a cigarrette. Also since then have been almost constantly been aware of my heart beating especially when lying down. I was also drinking quite a bit at that stage. Was still trying to excercise by going running. In January I then finally managed to quit smoking cold turkey. I went running everyday and my heart seemed fine. Was not aware of it and did not feel any extra beats. In March I went travelling for a few weeks and unfortunately started smoking again. I started being really aware of my heart beat again . Was also drinking quite a bit of alcohol during this time. In May I then managed to quit again cold turkey and excercised regularly. I then started feeling these extra beats again . Most noticably in the evening when lying down. Also intermittently more aware of my heart beating. Between May and august had the occasional social cigarrette with friends but have not smoked at all for the last 2 months. Have just recently moved to a new country and last week I felt really relaxed and happy and started excercising everyday and toward end of week did not feel any extra beats or my heart beating out of chest and felt really good. Then just suddenly 2 dys ago started feeling a bit tight chested with extra beats again. Have not drunk any alcohol in past week . Have had an ECG done at rest but that was normal . Have been declard fit to scuba dive. Am really worried about these heart beats. Could I have damaged my heart with all my smoking and drinking? Why have the extra beats returned even though I am at my most relaxed I have been in a long time and have not had any alcohol or cigarettes?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: PVC intermittently",
    "content": "Hi there -- There are several different issues which need to be addressed here, but first of all come the PVCs (which is very likely what you are feeling, but could be mixed with premature atrial beats -- PACs -- as is so very common). The fact is most of us have some premature beats -- PVCs and PACs -- off and on anyway. It is normal, common, and not diagnostic, in itself, of anything, although certain situations, drugs, substances, etc., can increase the frequency compared with the baseline number, which varies with most everyone. Also, smoking will make them more frequent (nicotine irritates the heart muscle and also constricts the blood vessels); alcohol makes them more freqeuent because of the opposite effect, since it causes the blood vessels to dilate somewhat. Both, by altering the state of the vessels, can make one more aware of one's heartbeat even when it is quite regular. Still, they are, of themselves, inconsequential, even though they may also appear more frequently in a diseased or injured heart. Since they occur normally (randomly) anyway, they don't give much  of a clue to what may be going on under the surface  That being said, you do have a very significant family history for heart disease, and so need to take this into consideration for the future. While as a young female you currenly enjoy some protection from naturally produced estrogen, you would likely be at some greater risk anyway, and once past menopause would be at significantly higher risk just based on the family history (although this may have been due almost entire to smoking). You also have been a smoker, which until you are no longer smoking, remains a risk factor (one that goes begins to diminish once you stop and within a year of no smoking, at your age, is no longer a risk factor). Another risk factor you carry is having used cocaine. Why this is so is not entirely clear, but we do know cocaine, while actively being used, can cause some pretty dangerous arrhythmias and, for some reason, does cause narrowing of the arteries in some people. Given all these factors, even though you are young and female, I would suggest a one-time cardiac workup to establish a baseline for your heart health, so it can be used for comparison purposes in the future. You are likely to come up totally clean with this, but even if you didn't it would be better to know what's going on in there now in order to get the jump on it. It is extremely likely nothing will show up at this point, and that should be good motivation to keep it that way.   All this is in spite of the premature beats which, as I've already pointed out, are not, of themselves, dangerous nor predictive of anything. It got your attention, and this caused you to bring your history to our attention, which is all to the good. Having a bad family history plus a history of smoking does increase your ultimate risk for heart disease, but the good news is it is early enough to prevent or at least manage any future problem and reduce the risk tremendously. I hope you'll consider doing this, and also seriously consider the huge risks posed by both tobacco and cocaine use. You have a rare oppotunity to avoid big trouble. I'd take advantage of that if it were me.   Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "PVCs, pregnancy, chest pain and burning, dizziness",
    "content": "Hello,  I have had PVCs (not diagnosed till last week) for about 1 1/2 years now and they were like a boom-boom deep in my chest that hurts. Sometimes I got 10 in a day, other times none for weeks, other times of stress they could have been 5 in a row almost. It seemed that stress, coffee and overwork made them worse.   I became pregnant, now 4 1/2 months and had an influenza infection type 2 then a bacterial infection which I caught from my daughter (she got it at school). Once I recovered and got a week of having some energy (due to second trimester starting) I worked hard and drank 2 mugs of coffee a day, plus some chocolate or sometimes a glass or 2 of coca-cola. Then I started to have these things like 30 a day and not just the beats, but I got pain in the chest, burning, burning the left hand instantly with a headache and dizziness after each strong beat. I had other beats that were not strong and would not hurt, those were ok to manage. Sometimes after eating I feel palpitations, but palpitations can come anytime really. I have been more breathless as well but that could be from anxiety over the PVCs and from pregnancy. I have also felt sometimes burning on the left leg and some strange feeling like bubbles moving down the leg, as if a vein was in contractions, which made me concerned about a potential clot? (never had them before).   I started to have what they call premature ventricular contractions or skipped beats, ectopic beats (they called them PVCs at emergency last Friday as they could see them on the monitor - been there 2 times now, once with 80 PVCs in a few hours - I am talking about felt ones, 7 in a minute was the worst).  So recently in the last few weeks I got instant chest pain, burning on the chest and under on the length of my right arm and hand to the last 2 fingers, tingling, sometimes numbness, sometimes either the veins in the left leg were twitching or the muscles not sure exactly, it felt like bubbles moving along the leg. I had also dizziness, ears getting blocked with pressure and popping, and just got so weak when I got these things it took 30 minutes sometimes to recover well from one beats. They are like forceful boom-boom beats in the chest that really hurt, other times I can feel them but they don't heart. Also the blood pressure went up after these beats, which they were recording at the hospital on some monitor. I had 4 days ago 90 with 50 - when I did not have an of these beats and on Friday night when I had 80 had 120/80. Pulse rate would go down for a few seconds when I had the beats then go back up to about 88.  They checked heart enzymes, nothing wrong there, checked levels of iron, calcium, potassium, all ok. Now I have to go for an electrocardiogram and a holter monitor soon. They really scared me though. From Friday on I had a few every day and palpitations, some chest pain and burning still and breathlessness alright. Today I am better, only a bit of chest pain, tightness and burning on the left arm because I already had about 5 beats. The doctors don't know why I get the extra chest pain, etc symptoms, but they come instantly after the beats and they say I am too young for that. They think maybe some problem in the electrical circuit of the heart, but not sure, I have to see a cardiologist. I have been so weak and sometimes just walking around the house brought them on, let alone other activities.  They say at the hospital they cannot do anything about it since I am pregnant and medication would pass to the baby. So I thought of asking you the following:  1. Are these PVCs dangerous if they come with these symptoms, the people at hospital said I don't need to worry except if they come in runs.   2. Can this be a blood clot, given the bubbling feeling in my leg?  3. Can anything be done after pregnanct?  I have heard that magnesium is pretty good, especially liquid magnesium to stop these, like 500 - 600 mg, but not sure it if it safe during pregnancy or in what amount to take? Can Vit C powder or B vitamins help? If you know of something that I could safely take, please let me know. It has been rather impairing on my life as even a little walk lately has stirred them up to come on, even sometimes walking around the house!  I have just moved house recently, so that could be a factor of extra effort (I had these beats about 30 a day for 2 weeks but then after I dropped the coffee only 5 in 2 weeks, so I work hard to pack the house, now we are moved to Slacks Creek - opposite to Springwood on the south side), but today even just walking through the house when I sat down on a chair to rest it got them started. I have observed that when I sat down to rest after doing maybe half a day of work got them started recently, but before they were coming rather randomly, working or not. I have had about 30 maximum in a day about 4 weeks ago and then stopped coffee, had 5 in 2 weeks and then moved house and had 25 in 2 hours and then 80 the next day (been to emergency once for having 16 in 1 1/2 minutes and then another time for 7 in a minute and 80 in total in a few hours). Yesterday was only a few, today about 4 before 9 am. As you can imagine, not been able to be active with a five year old is not exactly the best combination :-).\n\n",

    "title": "Re: PVCs, pregnancy, chest pain and burning, dizziness",
    "content": "Hi there -- First, the PVCs by themselves are not important nor are they diagnostic of anything. This is difficult for some people to believe because they seem so unpleasant and can cause anxiety which only leads to more of them happening. Actually the numbers of them you've mentioned are not even impressive. Some people have a \"normal\" rhythm where every other beat is a PVC (which would, given an average of 72 beats per minute, mean more than 50,000 PVCs in 24 hours! And still it means nothing. They can be more frequent with certain conditions, but they are not dangerous in themselves, and it is difficult to connect them to these conditions because they occur anyway at varying rates of frequency in almost everyone.   The burning pains you experience may be a thing peculiar to you, and PVCs can sometimes be painful, depending upon the timing of them. However, pain down the arm is unusual enough that this should be looked at more closely, although it may indicate a problem with the ulnar nerve rather than directly involving the heart, which seems to be in pretty good shape. It is also important to note that caffeine is a major aggravator of PVCs, and if a given person has them to start with, that person will have more PVCs by way of caffeine use. The choice then is presented as to whether or not a given person is willing to tolerate additional PVCs in exchange for the benefits of caffeine.  The sensation in your leg doesn't sound like what is typically felt when a clot is present, but it is unusual and worthy of at least a doppler ultrasound exam just to rule out the possibilty of a clot, since you are pregnant and this increases slightly your risk of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Your pregnancy also can increase the incidence and noticeability of PVCs because of the progressive crowding of the heart by structures in the abdomen. This is normal, as is increasing fatigue and other changes.   As for magnesium, while it is generally not a bad supplement to take, during pregnancy I would avoid anything that's not medically prescribed, regulated and understood. This won't help with the PVCs much even in a non-pregnant person, though there is some unscientific suggestion it may. After pregnancy the PVCs should start to lessen in frequency and if they remain a problem annoying enough to still seek help, beta blocker therapy is sometimes employed for people who have a hard time tolerating the palpitations caused by them, but it's usually better to avoid adding medications if they can be avoided.   My only real concerns are the burning pain in the ulnar aspect of your arm along with the PVCs, although I suspect this is a unique thing due to your personal anatomy; and the sensations in your leg, which can be cleared up with that doppler ultrasound exam. Other than these, you might consider avoiding caffeine til after the baby is born.   Good luck to you, I hope this helps clear things up for you, and please do follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Irregular heart beats / weird beats when excercising",
    "content": "Hello:  For the past couple of months i have been experiencing these weird heart, especially when I am hiking.  I'm not sure what exactly to call them but the experience basically feels like my heart feels like it pumps really hard and then skips a bit or pauses for a second.  It happens especially when i go on long or strenuous hikes.  It happens a few times and usually I'll stop and take a breath and the irregular beat stops as well.  Then as soon as i start up again it happens.  Also, when this happens it sometimes causes me to have panic attacks, or at least that's what i think, because followed bye the skipped beats later my heart will beat very rapidly and its hard to get it back to resting state even if i have taken a long break.  I consider myself to be in pretty good shape.  I lift weights 3-4 times a week and I go hiking at least once a week.  i eat pretty healthy, i do not smoke, and drink occasionally.  So this situation is really puzzling to me.  It's very uncomfortable and i think that there may be something wrong with my heart, because it seems to be getting worse.  If anyone has any ideas or advice i would greatly appreciate it it.  I would go to the doctor but I do not have insurance and I am tight on money, so any help would be great.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Irregular heart beats / weird beats when excercising",
    "content": "Hello -- What you describe sounds like a pretty common (and relatively normal) problem, exercise-induced premature heartbeats, most likely premature ventricular beats (PVCs) although they could be atrial (PACs) or a combination. This is a fairly common finding and is almost never dangerous. That being said, and given you may have experienced panic attacks in conjunction with these palpitations, it might be reassuring to have a cardiological workup and perhaps wear a Holter monitor or event monitor briefly to determine whether or not what's happening is, in fact, just clusters of premature beats. Oh, and before I forget, since this tends to happen when you're hiking, do you by any chance consume anything containing caffeine? Or for that matter, any so-called energy drinks (which also contain caffeine)? This can provoke more palpitations than might otherwise take place, and can also trigger, in the vulnerable, panic attacks. This latter is something often seen along with palpitations, either as a cause or as a side-effect (and this can work in either direction, with palpitations as trigger for panic or caused by panics). Again, it is extremely unusual for these to have any diagnostic significance whatsoever, and we all have these at various times, but some of us are more or less aware of them than others, and while most of us have them during quiet (at rest) times (in which case exercise usually makes them go away), some also have the paradoxical type that are brought on by exercise. They are extremely common in persons with mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVPS) and while this also is almost never dangerous, it is also commonly seen in conjunction with anxiety and panic disorder. These people tolerate exercise well in general, but can be interrupted by what seems momentarily erratic heart behavior.   On the off-chance this may not be premature beats but some other arrhythmia (such as supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation or flutter), while these are also not in themselves life-threatening, they can be disruptive at least, and also are eminently treatable (whereas premature beats are rarely treated, and almost always only to ease the emotional stress they cause).   I'd ask for a one-time cardio workup including resting and exercise EKG, blood work, a good listen to heart sounds, and perhaps a Holter monitor and even, if it seems reasonable, an echocardiogram. All of this is non-invasive and should rule out any extremely unlikely dangerous conditions. It is an especially good idea for the anxious patient with palpitations, as it can be very reassuring and if heart problems can be emperically eliminated, sometimes the anxiety/panic disorder can be isolated and effectively treated, and sometimes the reassurance alone is enough to ease this.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed and best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "My latest ECG showed a prolonged QT of 466 ms.  My electrophysicologist says it's a side effect of Flecainide but that it's nothing to worry about. I'm so frustrated.  I've been having chest pains off and on for a week now, every time I lay down my heart goes into a chaotic run that actually takes my breath away.  I've read the literature on the dangers of LQT.  I've also read that Flecainide use can actually \"unmask\" a concealed form of LQTS.  When I first began having arrythmia issues I actually thought that I had LQTS.  My syncope episodes were accompanied by that same wild and chaotic rhythm that I have when I lay down.  I began to lose consciousness and had profuse sweating, but no pain.  Luckily my heart would \"calm down\" after a few seconds and I would recover.  I've been diagnosed with some hypertophic cardiomyopathy, a possible PFO, Inappropriate Sinus Tachy, AVRNT, and induciable atrial flutter.  I failed a tilt test and was also diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension.  What leads me to believe this has been a concealed form of LQT all along is my symptoms.  Just being startled will cause my heart to jump into an excited rhythm, and what feels like multiple pvc's.  My loop recorder (now removed) showed couplets and triplets.  Loud noises will do it, laying down will do it, being emotionally upset will do it.  My question is, shouldn't the Flecainide be stopped?  LQT can cause sudden death.  If the medicine is causing this proarrythmic affect then shouldn't it be discontinued?    Can anyone refer me to a cardiologist in Lincoln NE or close that specializes in LQT?  HELP.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Flecainide induced LQT-466 ms",
    "content": "Hi there. First, given your history, I can think of no reason why Flecainiede would be prescribed, and plenty of reasons why it shouldn't have been. You're aware of the cons of using this drug. In your case I can see no pros. You may be correct about the \"hidden\" LQTS, although it's difficult to say when you're already under the influence of a medication that can prolong the QT, but from your description of prior symptoms it does sound like a distinct possibility, especially the startle reflex-related syncopal episodes. This is classic for LQTS, as you know.   Flecainide used to be used to suppress premature ventricular beats (PVCs) until the infamous CAST study showed a) PVCs rarely if ever need to be treated except to ease the emotional discomfort caused in certain patients, and b) any dedicated medication of the same class as Flecainide can cause the very potential lethal arrhythmias it was hoped could be averted by preventing the PVCs. In fact we now know half of all CICU patients who develp lethal arrhythmias have no prior PVCs immediately prior, and most ordinary healthy people do have occasional,sometimes frequent, PVCs.   There's nothing in your set of diagnoses that would warrant use of flecainide. A beta blocker would be the most likely class of medication used for most of the things found,  and especially in the possible finding of LQTS, which is often treated effectively by use of beta blockers. Using something so archly contraindicated makes no sense to me, and I would strongly suggest a second opinion/consult with a different EP specialist, as this is just very peculiar to say the least.   I don't know off hand who might be a worthwhile referral in your area, but perhaps someone here at The Lounge knows, or I can try and search my personal resources and see if I can come up with someone, as you definitely deserve a second opinion on this one. I just -- I know, I keep saying this -- doesn't make any sense.   Hope this is at least helpful. Good luck to you and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

When I was waiting around for a cardiology appointment, I decided that the dizziness felt like the last time I'd had a gastro bug (minus all other symptoms), and since gastrolyte made me feel better last time I thought I should try it again. I felt better pretty much immediately (hooray!). I've tried it a few other times and now keep some in my handbag for emergencies.  I've been saving the eIectrolyte solutions for only the really bad dizziness because I don't know if is ok to take it regularly without any gastro symptoms. I don't want to mess up my electrolytes or anything. I tried to ask the cardiologist but he successfully distracted me lol. According to some recent blood tests, my electrolytes are normal and I'm not dehydrated.   Does anyone know whether it is it ok to take electrolyte solutions regularly for this? How come it helps?  thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Electrolye solutions are OK used in regular dietary supplements for most of us...for example Gatorade and Powerade are both over the counter electrolyte preparations.  However, having a cardiac dysrhythmia can be caused from many reasons other than and electrolyte imbalance.  High or low levels of potassium in the blood can cause some heart rhythm problems; sodium and also calcium are some other chemicals which can cause such problems.  However, to know really if you have blood levels off the norm, the doc has to draw blood.    And please always pay attention to any heart symptoms.  If you get dizzy, get chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, nausea....pain in the back, shoulders, arms or jaws....GO TO THE ER IMMEDIATELY.    Also be careful.  We CAN take too much potassium.  Too much potassium is dangerous for the heart as well as having too little potassium in the blood.   I don't really know what kind of preparation you are talking about.

    "content": "Hi Debra, Thanks for your advice! I had a blood test a few weeks ago (completely normal - no electrolyte problems), so I don't think the fast heart rate is because of that. I also don't take any medications/drugs/smoking except for the very occasional coffee. I know I should probably avoid coffee too, but it seems to help with the dizziness too (weird huh?). I had a cup last night because I needed to stay up later than usual finishing off an assignment, and I felt absolutely great.  Thanks for your advice about what symptoms to watch out for, but I don't think it would be appropriate for me to go to the emergency room every time I feel dizzy - I don't think I'd ever leave!  The electrolyte solutions I was talking about were the type you get from the chemist (without a script) for fluid replacement when you have a gastro bug. They probably have similar ingredients to poweraide etc but I don't know. Since I don't have electrolyte problems, I was wondering if maybe they help with the dizziness by increasing my blood pressure? That might explain why the coffee helped too. I don't think I've had a low blood pressure reading but I haven't had my blood pressure checked while I've been dizzy. While I was sitting down and relaxed my blood pressure was 110/85 and my heart rate was 115.   If blood pressure and heart rate are linked, could my heart be beating fast to keep my blood pressure up?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Five years ago I started having rapid heart rates after increasing my exercise level or going up stairs. It would go (resting 90) to 100...110....120...BAM...180...190...200...at 200 I would grey out so I would stop what I was doing and it would take about 40 minutes to come back down to 80-90.  I did various treadmill stress tests which all showed the same pattern over and over again...I would push all 10 minutes running even though it hurt just to prove it...  The EKGs, Echos...all showed normal structures and rhythms except that it was fast. Tried a beta blocker but it made me feel like crap.  I am only 29 (28 at the time, 24 when it began) and decided I do not want to be on meds forever and I want to be active, climb with my friends, bike, run!! So I manage to get in with my Cardio's partner who is an electrocardiologist. He took one look at my tests and suggested I had SVT.    Based on the symptoms I have I think it is AVNRT. It is not always present..sometimes it will flutter now and then and speed up but never for more than a few seconds but if I exert myself...BAM....without a shadow of a doubt.  I decided to have an ablation at his request as this seems to be the best option. I just wanted to know if there are any other rhythms that present \"normal but just really fast\" on exertion to consider as far as the kind of SVT.  My triggers: Excersise Caffeine Stress 2 servings of alcohol  Anything more than moderation will put it over. But I have never just been \"struck\" and it has never gotten over 220 (and that is when I forced myself to run a mile and it hurt my chest like fire!)  Also, I know my heart is fine if the ablation is successful but how long do you recommend I wait before attempting a jog or run?  Thanks for your assistance.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: AVNRT - Ablation",
    "content": "Hi there --  While most of your symptoms are consistent with SVT due to AVNRT, the fact that they can be induced by exercise and never come on spontaneously leave me wondering just what is really going on. Some sort of SVT seems most likely, and AVNRT isn't out of the question, but the onset and triggers are both fairly unusual for that. An ablation would involve an electrophysiological (EP)study to try and locate the source and if it is AVNRT that would be discovered during the EP study. If the origin is somewhere else it's usually still amenable to ablation, so it sounds like a win-win to me, even though it behaves in a somewhat atypical manner (for AVNRT). The extremely high rates certainly do make it sound like AVNRT, which is the most common cause of SVT.  I would definitely go with the EP study/ablation, and as for the waiting period afterward, the main consideration is the catheter insertion site, which will keep you limited in activity for a couple days tops, but won't allow you to start running for probably a week or so. The heart part is more forgiving by comparison, but you really don't want to insult the insertion site and your cardiologist can give you the best time frame for resuming vigorous activity, but my best guess would be a week or two. You should be up and around in a day , two at the most, but will have to take it easy for about a week and then you still need to allow the site to heal beyond that time.   Hope this is helpful to  you. Please follow up with us as needed, and also update us as to the findings and outcome of the EPS/ablation. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "PVC's and Brugada Syndrome",
    "content": "My brother died when I was 16 and he was 18! He died in his sleep.  That was 1990 about 5 or 6 years ago my oldest sister started having heart problems which eventually was found out to be Brugada Syndrome.  They said this must have been what happened to my brother.  My sister then had a defibrillator put in and has had it shock her a couple of times but she is doing well!  Since Brugada Syndrome is hereditary they started testing the rest of my family!  They started with my mother and she has it so they figured that is where it started!  She now has a defibrillator.  Then they tested my little sister and she has it so she now has a defibrillator.  They then tested my other sister and she does not have it!  Then they started looking at me. I was terrified to be tested because I didnt want a defibrillator and I noticed that I started having PVC\"s (most likely because of all the stress..just started new job, had a pregnant wife and 3 people in my family just had a defibrillator put in)...I was so scared to get tested and finally my mom talked me into it!  I had a Procainamide Drip, MRI of the Heart, 2 week holter, echo, stress test....just about everything you can imagine and they found no evidence of Brugada Syndrome. So that was the good part, however ever since then I have had these darn PVC's and they scare the heck out of me.  My doctor told me that they have nothing to do with Brugada and to go live a normal life, but with my family history I still think that one of these PVC's is all of a sudden going to turn into Brugada and I will drop right there?  I don't really know what my question is other than how do I learn to live with these PVC's as just PVC's rather than something that will lead to Brugada.  I have been stressed ever since, I was on Lexapro but hate using drugs so I am not on anything now and take the once in awhile Xanax if I am having a really bad PVC day!  I know there is a direct link to my level of stress and my PVC's but I am still having a hard time believing that I am not going to drop dead!  Any advice or info would help.  Thanks  Jamie\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jamie,  First, congratulations on NOT having Brugada's. While  it was very important to rule this out, you don't have it, and not everyone in a family will get it. In fact, that's a pretty large per centage who  did. But you didn't, so now comes the difficult part, because we all get PVCs from time to time, and many  of us feel them. They are, as your doctor has pointed out, unrelated to Brugada's syndrome, and they are not diagnostic nor prognostic of anything. They are, as you know, increased by stress, as well as by digestion, winding down at night, gas, stomach upsets, caffeine, nicotine, alchohol, and a ton of other common and harmless things. It's an awful thing, psychologically, to have to deal with , but in time it will hopefully start to seem more like background  noise to you as you realize these things will not do anything to you. It's far more complicated, cognitively, because of what you know about your family history, but you dodged the bullet,  so you might want to consider a brief course of both cognitive therapy and psychoanalysis, to try and help yourself get on the right side of this. I'd normally recommend cognitive therapy to a lot of people who suffer from PVC-induced anxiety, but you've actually been traumatized by events around you, and it may be more difficult for you to let go of this on your own. If so, by all means find someone who can help you talk your way through this. But what  I can tell you is that PVCs are unrelated to Brugada's, they are actually normal, and they tend to come and go.   I  really hope this is helfpul. It's an unusual situation you're in, and you ought to take advantage of any help available, as this has probably been more traumatic for you than even you realize. Best of luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jamie,  You're very welcome and I'm so glad you're making progress with this. It's difficult enough for people to just deal with PVCs, even though they are basically \"normal\", but it has to be especially difficult having had the terrible trauma and loss and family history as well. Still, you're doing great with this. I'm very impressed and am confident you'll retrain yourself to reduce your emotional reaction to these events which are bothersome enough in the best of circumstances. The fish oil has some very positive, if anecdotal, evidence going for it, and if it seems to help it certainly won't do any harm.   Thanks so much for the followup. I'm really happy to hear your doing so well. I hope you and your family will manage to adjust to this challenge. Please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "John,  I went in to see my cardiologist about an increase in my PVCs.  He is doing another 48 hour holter and a stress test this week but says he doesnt see anything life threatening and doesnt expect to see anything different on the holter or stress test because of my test last May!   He did say that he would be willing to do an ablation on me and that my PVCs are the type most commonly seen and come from an area of the heart that is easy to ablate (not his exact words but was just letting me know I have the most common type of PVCS etc)  I told him that when we had this talk last year that he said he wasnt willing to do an ablation on me and he said that was because then it wasnt affecting the quality of my life and now that I have daily anxiety etc that he would do it for me......I asked him what he thought his success rate would be and he said his is better than 70%.  So iguess my questions are...This is a benign condition that is only in my head, do you think I should consider such a drastic elective surgery?  What do you think of ablation?  You said you have PVCs....would you ever consider an ablation for your PVCs?  Is there anything else you can add to this discussion about ablations or what you know of PVCs? Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Please help! Bradycardia",
    "content": "Hello --  While  an elevated heart rate is often seen with anxiety, slow rates usually are not. This sounds like a metabolic problem most likely,  but you'll need to find out for sure what's going on, and if your doctor isn't interested in persuing this,  then you'll need to find a cardiologist who will rule out underactive thyroid, as well as several possible electrical causes, such as sinus node malfunction and AV node problems. If these are not present then this rate, which is not  dangerously slow, may have become normal for you or may be due to excessive vagal stimulation from something you're doing (or not) unawares. Some people who  are very physically fit do have remarkably slow rates, but those don't usually suffer from fatigue and lassitude such as you describe, which could be secondary to the slow rate or could be due to onset of hypothyroidism. Your doctor's answer is definitely not adequate, so I hope you'll press for a more thorough exam or referral to a cardiologist.  Hope this is helpful to you. Good luck and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: light headedness, heart palpitations, twitch on left side",
    "content": "Hello --  You may have nothing in particular going on, and we can reasonably ignore the twitch for now, as it's definitely not cardiac-related. You may also be  an anxious person, which means you will be more aware of all these sensations and inclined to wonder if they may all be related (the twitch definitely is not). Further, while the lightheadedness could possibly be related to some heart issue, it's far more likely to be caused by some other issue such as sinus infection, vertigo (inner ear problem) or any one of a number of other innocent things. This can be determined as a rule without too much trouble in the doctor's office. The palpitations are very likely due to normal premature heartbeats which we all have from time to time,but become more aware of them when they increase in frequency or have other things going on at the same time. Anxiety, unfortunately, can also make them increase, although if they are due to premature beats they are no health threat at all. Best thing for you to do would be to run all this by a sympathetic MD who can do a face-to-face office exam, check you for vertigo (and treat if necesary, a very easy thing as a rule), and do a 12-lead EKG to look for anything unusual and put your mind at ease about your heart. Since you recently had a checkup, it may be all that's required is the EKG, but vertigo also should be considered, and anxiety needs to be addressed if it's the cause of this.  The combo of twitching, palpitations and lightheadedness are all classic for anxiety, so this is likely to be brought up. If so, go with it and work at it from that angle, since this is very common, especially in your age group.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

I've read of anxiety and I'm definitely not lacking in the stress department but I don't feel scared or worried of people or worried of some horrible catastrophe and my aforementioned symptoms are the only ones I have that I can relate to anxiety all the other symptoms I should feel if suffering from anxiety (based only on what I've read of course) are not present.  I'm going to have some lab work done Wed as well so again, hopefully I will get some answers (which I'll post on here in case others can relate to my unfortunate situation).\n\n",

I have had a few EKG's, a few holter/event monitors and just two weeks ago I had a stress/echo done.  It did show \"occasional PAC couplet\" which I felt and saw one on  the EKG as it happened, other than that the echo came back normal according to my doctor.  my EF was 55-60% No ischemia 89% HR acheived It says less than 1mm depression at 80 msec post J point Comments: Rare fusion complex  I have no idea what those last two comments mean, and neither did my doctor. It would help for me to know they are or aren't of potential concern.  I do not get palps with anxiety per se anymore, they just come one at a time and go, but what concerns me is having these couplets WHILE exercising.  I started a brisk walking routine about 2 months ago and a few times I have felt a skipped beat.  I have not had my cholesterol level checked yet.

Also, while PVCs (not PACs) used to be considered problematic when occurring during exercise (and they are more common at rest), they  can occur during either state and mean nothing. PVCs are more likely during rest, sleep, and after meals. PACs, however, are common, when they do occur, regardless of activity. They are also more likely to occur  during exercise randomly. PVCs have absolutely no diagnostic nor prognostic significance, even in the critical care setting. PACs rarely have any significance, although they can, in some people, be precursors of various atrial arrhythmias which are not life-threatening. You've not had that problem, so are just having PACs and occasional PVCs, which means you're in good company -- you're normal. And  while both PACs and PVCs can be made more frequent due to anxiety, they also sometimes just happen for no specific reason. I assure you, though, the one thing that's not causing them is Klonopin. Also, that is a very excellent tool for getting a handle on anxiety and especially panic disorder. It will not provoke premature beats.  As for those last two notations on the stress-echo report, bear in mind everything that is under consideration is also commented upon, even if it's within normal limits. This is so you have an accurate set of baseline data for comparison with any future tests. So: \"less than 1 mm depression at 80 msec post J point\" means exactly that. Well, what it really means is the precise measurement of how there is no ischemia. In other words, a normal finding. It's an observation about your EKG tracing during the stress test, and it's what you want, nothing you don't want. The \"rare fusion complex\" means, again, exactly that, but of course doesn't explain. One would expect a doctor to know this one, but I guess specialization takes a certain toll. A fusion beat is merely a meaningless event where a PVC happens to fall exactly on the regular sinus beat. It means nothing,  but it is visible, so must be noted, since it is something other than a regular sinus beat. This is what happens  routinely in most people but isn't noticed because we're not being monitored all the time.   I'll  admit palpitations during exercise feel more funny than those at rest, because the heart's beating harder. Still, they have no meaning and it's best to try and learn to ignore them as best you can. I know that's not always easy, but it's a worthy goal anyway.  In short, you're in great shape, you're making excellent progress with the panic attacks and anxiety, and the  future looks bright. Enjoy!  I hope this is helpful and if you have any further questions please don't hesitate to follow up with us here. Good luck to you!\n\n",

Breaking those terms down for me and explaining how they report for baseline purposes makes sense. Yes, the whole exercise palpitation thing had me confused, but you have helped clear that up.  Why didn't my doctor take the time to explain this to me?  She had to have known I was going to go home with my results and google everything I didn't recognize on it.:-) Thanks again John, Leah\n\n",

I wonder if sometimes they don't just forget these things are hardly self-evident to laypeople. At any rate, I'm very happy to know this was helpful to you. And you know, maybe you've made a very important observation here that needs to be shared and spread among the medical community: people will, if they are left holding some mysterious medical information, go home and google them! It's natural now, it's human nature to want to know, and they could really save the patients (and themselves) a lot of anxiety by taking an extra minute or two, even if its only to tell the patient how to effectively look up what they want to know. The internet is part of our lives now.   Again, you're very welcome.\n\n",

    "content": "Let me start off saying that I am a 31 year old male. I exercise regularly (mountain bike) and eat fairly healthy. (was a vegetarian for about 10 years)   About a month ago one day I was eating lunch and I noticed that when I swallowed food, my heart would race for a second and then go back to normal, until I swallowed another bite. It would feel as though my heart was jumping out of my chest. If Im not eating I feel fine. When I excercise I feel fine, no problems.  I have done an EKG which was normal. The sonogram of my heart was normal. I have worn a heart monitor for 2 weeks which showed that my heart would race when ever I swallowed food.  I had a endoscopy that showed gastritus and esophogitus. I have been taking Prilosec OTC for a month. I was taking a lot of Advil for headaches so I think I caused damage. Havent touched it in over a month.  I have noticed that liquids don't cause the reaction unless its an ice cold smoothie. I have been eating soup broth as it doesnt set it off.  I have done some research about the Vagus Nerve. Could this be the culprit? How does this happen (cause) and what is done to test this and remedy this?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter was born in Dec of 2001.  She seemed to be very healthy with no major illnesses until the past coulple of years.  It started just sitting at the table and she all of the sudden screamed in pain and grabbed her chest.  As I put my hand on her chest I noticed it was was beating very rapidly and hard.  It lasted for a couple of minutes and passed.  It happened again the next week so I took her to our PCP.  They ordered an ekg and a sonogram of her heart.  All tests came back normal.  It continued to happen occasionally.  Sometimes weekly, sometimes monthly.  My PCP sent her to a childrens cardiologist where they performed an ekg again and recommended that she wear an event recorder to try and catch the problem.  After wearing the recorder for a few months we were not successful on getting a reading.  The episodes seemed to slow down but have never stopped completely.  It has been about two years and they are starting to happen more frequently again.  The most recent episodes have been two weeks ago and today.  By the time I got her to our PCP, it had passed.   In the last week while watching TV with my husband a commercial came on about Paxil and heart defects in children.  I knew I had taken it for a about three months but couldn't remember the time to be exact.  After contacting my OBGYN today, I was told that it was prescribed to me on 9-27-01.  My heart sank and I have been doing some research online since.  Today my PCP said her file from the cardiologist mentions Wolff Syndrome and Supraventricular Tachycardia.  What is the difference between the two and what tests can be done to diagnose her for sure?  We head back to the cardiologist next week and I would appreciate any advice.  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome and Paxil",
    "content": "Hi there --  While there are some teratogenic adverse side effects (potential birth defects including those involving the heart) in the literature on Paxil, what you've found in your daughter's records would likely not be  related to the Paxil use, which had generally caused structural defects. Also, WPW generally shows up a little later, usually in early adolescence (but of course there are exceptions). I'm not certain why this would have been noted in the cardiologist's records, since nothing was found, unless it was intended as a \"note to self\" to try and rule out WPW and/or SVT which might explain her odd  episodes.   Since you personally were able to detect rapid and forceful beating of the heart, and since the onset of arrhythmias associated with WPW as well as SVT from any cause may be sudden, startling and frightening, your daughter might well, at her age, react with a cry of alarm at onset of a brief burst of such rapid or irregular beating. In fact, based on the limited description you've provided this has probably been sudden, brief episodes of a tachyarrhythmia, probably SVT.   Now the good news: SVT, while extremely unpleasant feeling, is generally not life-threatening, although it can be very disruptive to whatever activity is going on when it happens. Some people, children included, may have random attacks of this, often for no discernable reason. Structural defects have been ruled out, so the only other possibilities are idiopathic (no known reason), or an abnormal re-entry or bypass tract, defects which would not likely be caused by Paxil use, but which are often found at random in the general population,  sometimes as an inherited thing.   WPW is another story, and young people who have it do need to have it managed til they''re old enough to have it corrected permanently (a fairly simple in-and-out procedure). But I think the cardiologist was simply thinking out loud about this, and if you check with either him or the PCP you might ask why the mention of it, since it is very easy to detect on EKG, haviing a characterisitc \"trademark\" delta wave. If this is present then so is WPW,  and it can be managed with medication  until the child is old enough to undergo radio frequunecy ablation (RFA) to cure it.  These sorts of episodes can be so random, especially the less troublesome atrio-ventricular nodal re-entry  tract (AVNRT)- caused SVT, that it may  be by luck alone that it is caught on a monitor's strip. (AVNRT is cured the same way as WPW but is less potentially serious).   I hope this helps. Please follow up with us here as needed and please keep us updated as well. Good luck to you and your daughter.\n\n",

They did another ekg on her and did rule out the Wolff Syndrome.  She agreed that the paxil probably has nothing to do with my daughters racing heart.  She recommended that she wear the event recorder for two months to see if we can get a good reading on what's going on.  Since there is nothing structurally wrong with her heart she assured us that whatever it is, it is not life threatening and it is fixable.  We are hoping to catch something on the event recorder this time to confirm a diagnosis.  In the meantime she said our daughter is healthy and to continue on as usual and not to worry.  I will keep in touch and let you know how things are going.  Thanks again for your response.\n\n",

    "content": "Wonderful news! Thanks for this update. The event recorder makes perfect sense and is only a minor inconvenience most of the time. It may also capture, eventually, what's causing the tachycardia. This may, in fact, be AVNRT, which is not life threatening but also doesn't have much of an EKG \"signature\" like WPW, so if that's the case it would likely require capturing an event. That's the frustrating part, since this can be such a random-occurring thing. Good luck with this and I'm very happy to hear all the truly scary stuff has been ruled out.

    "content": "Hi Sarah,  These symptoms could conceivably be caused by something worthy of concern, but are really pretty common and are often seen in young females mostly, in association with mitral valve prolapse (MVP), a benign variant that usually doesn't mean much in itself, but which for some reason is often associated with these symptoms and anxiety (which also can exist independently and cause the same symptoms, which only serves to confuse the picture). I'm glad you have a doctor appointment, and if you don't have anything remarkable or different happen between now and the  appointment you should be fine. If anything really offbeat happens I would go on in to the ER, but be prepared to be told it's anxiety-related. (That's no reason to not go if you're really concerned, just something that usually comes up right away and is often accurate). The symptom of feeling as though one can't get a satisfying, deep breath is almost always due to anxiety and an over-awareness of one's breathing habits, throwing everything off, causing unwitting hyperventilation and subsequent weird symptoms like numbness in the hands and around the mouth, a sense of lack of air, etc. This is classic for anxiety/panic disorder, and is also commonly seen in people with MVP (something else I would not be surprised to learn is found if the exam goes that far).   You should have an EKG, some standard bloodwork, and a good office physical exam, but I think it will yield just what I'm telling  you here. In the meantime take it easy, and follow up with us here if you have any questions at all. Good luck to you,.\n\n",

If you are not providing your body enough oxygen during your night sleep, you will feel fatigued throughout the day regardless of how many hours of sleep you have had. It is called Sleep Apnea. Sleep Apnea is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, high blood pressure, arrhythmias, diabetes, fatigue, depression and anxiety. You may wish to rule this out before you settle for the text book answer of \"anxiety\".  Best of Luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  First, you can expect, while pregnant, these will be more frequent, although they are normal in the general population, just not many are aware of them til they become frequent. In pregnancy it can be aggravated either by hormonal changes or, later, by pressure on the diaphragm as the heart doesn't like to be \"touched\" and will often kick back in annoyance. It almost never means anything, except that when new or frequent these can feel alarming. If they persist and you find them very annoying or productive of anxiety you could reasonably ask for a holter monitor,which might at least help put your mind at ease, since very frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are extremely common in normal, healthy hearts.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please do follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "For about a half a year now, I've been having strange fainting spells.  At first, they started very sporadically and with no warning.  Maybe once a month or so I'd lose consciousness for a brief period of time.  They were sometimes accompanied by a rapid heart rate when I awoke.  Sometimes there's a lightheaded feeling, panting, rapid heart rate before fainting, and sometimes there's no detectable warning.  The duration of the fainting spells also varies.  Sometimes I'll pass out for less than a minute, and sometimes I'll be unconscious for three to five minutes, or very rarely more.  When I wake up, I'm disoriented for a few seconds and then I can usually continue with whatever I was doing.  Occasionally, my peripheral vision is gone upon waking and it looks like I'm seeing through a cloudy, black tunnel.  Lately, the fainting has been increasing in frequency.  Where I used to maybe faint once a month or once a week, I've now found myself fainting at least once a day or more for a few days in a row, and then no fainting for a while, and then a lot more of this pattern.  I've fainted up to as often as five times in one day, and it scares me.  I fainted while driving, but was fortunately not in an accident.  Also, a bit before all the fainting started, I noticed that I was having heart irregularities, where it would feel like I was being choked in my chest or my heart rate would randomly beat faster or slower, or seem to \"hiccup\" or skip a beat.  Would anyone have any idea what this might be?  Any and all insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Possible arrhythmias and fainting randomly?",
    "content": "Hi there --  First, you need to get clear on just what's causing all this, and the sooner the better. I can't imagine putting up with all that for half a year! While it may be basically innocent (there are so many possible causes, including benign and malignant arrhythmias, other electrical problems, dysautonomia, even seizures) it could also be something more serious, and even a basically benign arrhythmia or other cause of fainting can be dangerous if you're driving or simply  wind up hitting your head on something.  It does sound like you're having some sort of arrhythmia happen, and these can cause or be associated with fainting, which is something you just can have happening all the time. At best you'll wind up whacking your head on something, but it could be even more dangerous than that. You need to be seen by a cardiologist and soon, and preferably by an electrophysiologist (cardiolgist who specializes in arrhythmias). Many arrhythmias are very easy to manage or even eliminate, but they first have to be diagnosed. First thing you need to have is a 12-lead EKG, and if that doesn't reveal anything, then an echocardiogram (neither is invasive nor takes much time), and then perhaps wear an event monitor for a few weeks to try and catch this activity, whatever it is. And please, next time this  happens, get yourself to the nearest emergency room, as they may be able to catch what is going on and document it. This is a very important part of getting this resolved. There are several electrical problems of the  heart that become common in adolescence and some of them are more serious than others, but anything that causes repeated fainting is serious until we know otherwise.   I hope this helps. Please do follow up with us here as needed, follow up also with a cardiologist, do not hesitate to go to the ER if this happens even one more time, and please keep us updated as well. Again, it may be something very innocent, but we don't know that, so til we do we will treat this as potentially serious. Okay? Now stay in touch with us here and I hope to hear from you soon. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "My 13 year old daughter used to be very outgoing and active. She was even cheerleading captain this past year. However, about 4 months ago she started changing. She started complaining about being dizzy all the time. One day she fainted in the kitchen floor. A tilt table test showed that her BP drops when she stands. It was recommended that she just increase her salt intake. She complains of being dizzy a lot, has chest pains, blacks out, short of breath and fatigued all the time. She has problems making it through PE class. She wore a holter monitor for 24 hours, but she didnt do normal activities while wearing it because we were out for snow. Here are her results from that test. Can you help me in understanding what is going on with her. She doesn't act anything like her old self. The dizzyness and fatigue control her life now.  average heart rate: 83 BPM 6 pauses exceeding 2.0 seconds were noted. 298 ventricular ectopics noted.  VE: 14 couplets and 3 runs....some of the ventricular beats occured in bigeminal cycles. 805 supraventricular ectopics were noted. 112 couplets, and 35 runs noted.   Please help me understand these. She has an appointment with an electrophysiologist in a few weeks. What is causing her to be so fatigued?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 13 year old girl Holter Monitor results help!",
    "content": "Hello -  Well, the tilt table test was more revealing than the Holter monitor, but together they explain a lot. The tilt table demonstrated possible neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS), a problem with the apparatus that regulates the blood  pressure and heart rate so that one is able to stand up without all the blood pooling in one's abdomen and legs. This can be treated with medication if necessary. It's not serious at all, but can be awfully disruptive.  The Holter report is fairly non-revealing, except that in additon  to the above issue there is a lot of ectopy (premature heartbeats) arising from both the upper and the lower chambers. There were several rather long pauses, presumably sinus pauses, which may be normal for someone her age (sinus arrhythmia, affected by breathing patterns, slowing down during inspiration and picking back up during exhalation); there were also a few triplets, three-beat \"runs\" of what is technically (and arbitrarily) ventricular tachycardia; more of these PVCs occurred in pairs or as bigemeny, which simply means every other beat is a premature beat for an indefinite period, which usually causes there to be more on the recording than would be otherwise, but basically means nothing;  there were, most interestingly, lots of premature atrial contractions, apparently a whole lot of them coming in \"runs\" as well, although the duration of those isn't noted (usually because they are considered relatively benign), but there were 35 such runs of supraventricular tachycardia. If this is happening off and on during the day, this could cause a lot of symptoms including lightheadedness, dizziness, feelings of presyncope or actual fainting, fatigue, interruption of exercise tolerance (that is to say, exercise is well tolerated until this happens, at which point it may interrupt the ability to carry on the activity til it stops).   Since there are a number of things,  some of them relatively normal and some a little bit problematic, the consult with the EP specialist makes eminent sense. The EP doctor can sort out what's causing these things, if they are related, and what can be done to manage or correct them. Some of this stuff that showed up really is normal and doesn't pose any sort of problem. The triplet runs of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) may raise an eyebrow, but if there's nothing structurally wrong and these are tolerated well,  they probably have little to no significance. The runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), however, could be causing a lot of the problem -- a lot of the symptoms -- and this is something that can definitely be fixed, either by medication or, more effectively, via radiofrequency ablation (RFA). This latter will no doubt be offered as a possible way of correcting the problem, and is the most effective and most permanent way of correcting that particular problem. This may be at the bottom of the suspected neurocardiogenic syncope (which I am assuming was part of the tilt table finding -- though it may have not actually showed upthat way).   Basically the Holter monitor report shows a lot of random activity, most of it not very unusual, but with a lot of runs of SVT, which could be the cause of all the problems. It's also possible there is more than one thing going on, and both NCS and SVT can be treated medically the same way. However, the SVT part is best corrected permanently (which is the rule, although sometimes an RF ablation does fail to \"take\" -- rarely) and could possibly resolve all the problems at once.   Since the symptoms are so marked, I feel it would be foolish of me to speculate beyond what I've thrown out here prior to the EP consult. That should really clear up a lot of questions,  as there are any number of electrical anomalies that could be causing this, most of them fairly simple to correct or treat. I hope you'll update us following the consult, and of course please follow up with us here at any point as needed.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck to you and your daughter.\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome.   The runs of V-tach were only triplets, so were all very short bursts. This happens a lot in young people and often goes unnoticed. The longest SVT run of 98 beats would have been one which would, depending upon the speed, have been long enough to notice and maybe even cause symptoms.   VT is often well-tolerated in healthy young people, and if there is no structural disease or electrical abnormality (such as long Q-T syndrome) then it often passes in the shuffle, unlike sustained runs of SVT.  While SVT is usually the complaint most registered in otherwise healthy young people with symptoms, it's not unheard of to have both VT and SVT show up, especially if there's an electrical abnormality or (especially) in cases of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) with symptoms. This may well be the case, even though the actual prolapse sometimes cannot be visualized and so doesn't get listed in the diagnosis. All this should come to light during the EP consult and study. There are a number of other heritable problems that also can cause this sort of array of signs and symptoms. Usually they are more an annoyance than anything else, but obviously can also cause a lot of anxiety and disruption.   I hope this further clarifies things, and please keep us updated.\n\n",

When she was in second grade she would have episodes where her she would have chest pains and her heart would be beating so hard that it would bounce your hand off her chest. The family doctor said that he heard a \"click\" and that he believed she had MVP. He referred her to a cardiologist. However, the cardiologist said that he didn't think she had MVP because the echo cardiogram showed only a trace amount of mitral regurgitation.  Since then though, the family doctor and her pediatrician both hear (not all the time though) the standard \"click\" that is associated with MVP.

    "content": "The \"click\" murmur, which is pretty much a classic sign of MVP, can be variable. There are times when it is heard only rarely, while if one gets lucky it will be heard by more than one doctor, which is more convincing. As to the regurgitation factor, this is usually only trace or mild with MVP anyway, and the condition is extremely common. It is rarely a serious or progressive problem, although with a certain small subset it can cause more troublesome issues over time. It certainly is typical of MVP to be associated with the sort of \"galaxy\" of symptoms such as your daughter has been having, which occur in some and not in others. It's also not clear in all cases just why these symptoms occur, since they don't as a rule seem to have much of a direct connection with the mild valve abnormality, but arise from the autonomic nervous system (which, interestingly, develops in utero at about the same time as the mitral apparatus.  When MVP syndrome is treated at all, it is usually first with a beta blocker drug, and if there is persistent atrial tachyarrhythmia, sometimes with a calcium channel blocker as well, or sometimes with radio frequency ablation if there is an associated electrical issue involving redundant nerve tissue causing an unwanted conduction pathway. Everything else is largely a matter of teaching accomodation of the symptoms, keeping well-hydrated, and following a progressive aerobic exercise program as tolerated.   In the case of the rare progressive problem with the valve, it may (and I can't stress enough how unusual this is compared with the total number of documented MVP patients) eventually require replacement with a prosthetic valve. I only mention this because there is that very small subset of patients with connective tissue disease who eventually experience progressive problems with the valve. The vast majority do just fine, especially with the combination of medication and learning to live with what is essentially an occasionally major annoyance.\n\n",

    "content": "Ok my daughter had her appointment with the EP doctor today. Her pediatrician was concerned about how she seems to be getting weaker so she pushed to get us in quicker. He explained that there are 3 main types of SVT and that 85% of people who have SVT fall into the 1st type. 10% have the second type. And that only 5% have the more rare; Atrial Ectopic Tachycardia. He said that the Atrial Ectopic is what he believes she has. He is supposed to call me tomorrow with the appointment date to do the EP study.  He said that he is concerned about what the damage the AET will do to her heart long term since her symptoms have become so complex in just four months. The doctor said that this particular arrhythmia is usually drug resistant in teens.  He is going to try to do the RF ablation. However, he said that it is not always successful when treating AET and sometimes the second attempt isn't successful either. He said they will only try the RFA twice.  Does this sound pretty typical to you? I am glad to finally have some answers but it still leaves a lot of questions. If it is drug resistant and the RFA doesn't fix it, what would happen then? Because he makes it sound like heart failure is what will happen if we don't get this under control.\n\n",

    "content": "That explains a lot. This isn't something that comes to mind quickly -- at least not to my mind -- and maybe because I've never actually encountered anyone with this particular form of SVT in \"real\" life. I had actually imagined it was most likely the second type, which is itself relatively rare. AET is quite rare, and for some reason it's associated with weakening and dilation of the left ventricle, although why isn't clear. It's probably also not important, at least in the short term. What is is to get the arrhythmia abolished or at least managed.   RF ablation for this form of SVT has, based on my (abstract) knowlege of it, a success rate of 75-100%, which is pretty good. There are a number of doctors who would rule out a third attempt if the first and second failed to obliterate the Arrhythmia, and with this one being more resistant to the usual treatments, that would make sense. It does, however, respond to some of the more exotic and less-used medications, so that if a first and second ablation attempt were to be unsuccessful (or even less than successful), there are several very good medications available to manage it in whole or in part (depending on the outcome -- which of course is still more likely to be fully successful).   We'll be anxious to hear how this all unfolds. Thanks for the update, and it certainly does make sense. I hope the ablation can be performed promptly and that it is very successful. Please let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey. I just wanted to update and get your opinion. My daughter had her EP study and RF ablation on March 2nd. It took about 3 1/2 hours to do the procedure. When it was over, the dr came out and said that they burned 2 spots and that he thought he got it all. However, 5 hours after the surgery, her monitors started going off and showing that she was having SVT. They told me to give it a week and then things would be ok. Well here it is almost 2 months later and getting worse. Her pediatrician was concerned because she is starting to get really symptomatic  again (dizzy, fatigued). When she exercises she gets really short of breath and feels like she is going to pass out. When I put my hand on her chest it feels like its bubbling or fluttering. I've never felt that before. Anyway, her pediatrician put her back on the holter monitor and this is what it says now... 260 supraventricular ectopics 9 venticular ectopics 34 isolated supraventricular events 7 couplets 17 runs minimum heart rate was 50 bpm fastest heart rate was 283 bpm  Ok, now my questions. What are your opinions about these results? Should we repeat the ablation? And, why does it seem like she is becoming more symptomatic as the time goes by. She complained just a little after the surgery but I notice that she is starting to get like she was before.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Wendy,  We don't know what sort of arrhythmia you've had for the past 20 years, but my best guess would be some sort of occasional premature heartbeat, which is very common, and moreso among people with anxiety problems. I have no idea what is meant by \"short abnormal\" heartbeat, but perhaps you could elaborate.   The skin pressure allergy is probably dermagraphism, which is very annoying,  and Benadryl is probably the most effective treatment for this, although of course it can cause drowsiness and, in some people, palpitations as well.   Your mother's offer of the single lorazepam (brand name Ativan) was very kind, and it actually probably would be helpful, but since it is illegal to share one's precription drugs with anyone else,  and especially FDA schedule I and II drugs. Combined with Benadryl, even if this were your own prescription, the two together would probably make you sleep and possibly cause you to be disoriented during your flight or, worse, upon arrival. The Benadryl should actually provide sufficient sedation for the flight, but if you suspect a high anxiety situation then what you would best do is contact your own physician and ask him if he'd be willing to prescribe something similar, just for your flight out and back (two or three tablets). Some doctors are willing to do this, and it's not illegal to do, but transfer of prescription drugs between people is definitely not legal, and this is to protect you from potential unwanted and even dangerous side effects. Your mother was kind but misguided in offering this favor. Please contact your doctor about the upcoming trip and he may well allow you a few of this or something similar just for this occasion.   I hope this is helpful.  Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

There is a name for it, but I cant think of what they called it now. It is where on paper in a normal heart beat the line goes up and comes down and then has a smaller line right after that goes up and down. I don't have anything after the big line. So he called it an abnormal \"short heartbeat\". He told me to get it checked out. So thats on my list eventually. On the other subject, do you think taking benedryl on a dailey basis is bad for me? Also, do you think its something that I will have to gradually stop taking. You had mentioned that it can cause arrhythmais in your heart. I have noticed that on occasion, but it seems like it also relaxes my heart too. I wonder if I were to stop taking it, would it then affect my heart in a bad way?\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome, and great job on taking the trip without medical assist! That's a big deal right there.   What you've described as a \"short heartbeat\" now may make sense, and sounds like perhaps a shortened interval  or perhaps a missing wave (flat T-wave or short R-R interval). None of these are especially concerning, but of course should be on your \"to do\" list, just to be sure there's no electrical problem. Doesn't sound  like there is, however.   About the Benadryl, some people find it necessary to take it on a regular basis and if you tolerate it well then there's no reason to not take it as directed. While some people complain that it (and most other older antihistimines) sometimes causes palpitations or arrhythmias, they are never serious ones, just annoying. If it seems  to help (and it does have sedative properties) then there's really no reason to stop it, and while you might have some mild rebound effect from stopping abruptly (this happens with a lot of drugs), it shouldn't be a severe on, and shouldn't have much of any effect on your heart.  Again, about the trip, good job! Hope you enjoyed your time away, too. And as for the Benadryl, again if it's working for you I wouldn't stop it. I would plan to have a cardiologist evaluate a 12-lead EKG so you can know what exactly is \"abnormal\" (if it still is at that point) and why, if only to add to your baseline medical information, as this is always useful.  Good luck to you and thanks for getting back to us.\n\n",

Have had Paroxysmal AFib since 1999 which started out with only 1 or 2 episodes a year and has been increasing. Had a positive stress test in 2004 with normal cardiac cath, echo of heart is normal. I began having chest pain and shortness of breath 1 1/2 yrs ago only with exertion.  I swim and do water arobics 4-5 days a week. I started with a new PCP 3 months ago, who discontined/changed my hypertension meds and ever since I have been having shortness of breath and chest pain with minimal exertion, and severe pitting edema.  I woke up one morning and noticed my legs and feet were swollen and they continue to swell.  I have gained 15 pounds.  It doesn't go away completely at night.  My abdomen is also swollen. I was started on lasix which helped alot at first, I lost all of the fluid weight I had gained. But it quickly came back.  Lasix was increased and due to low potassium I developed atrial fib which I had to be admitted to the hospital 3 weeks ago.  I was not started on coumadin due to my Parkinson's disease and the fear that I might fall and due to all of my other meds. I was also found to have a low hemaglobin at 10.2 which has since fallen to 9.7.  While in the hospital I had another echo of my heart which again was normal.  My doctor has run tests on my kidneys and said they were normal, so she doesn't think my edema is related to kidneys or my heart.   My cardiologist doesn't know why I have angina and SOB with exercise since all my tests are normal. I have not seen my cardiologist since developing the edema. Should I let him know, I feel like I am complaining too much. Any ideas?  Do I just have to get used to the edema like my PCP said?  Thank you, Rueljo\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rueljo,  Pitting edema is not normal.  Basically, it occurs only for a limited number of reasons.  It can be that the heart is not moving fluid around properly (as with congestive heart failure), if the kidneys are loosing too much protein (protein helps keep the fluid in the blood vessels and out of the tissue), or if the liver isn't making enough protein.    There are several causes within those three areas but they are the big three areas that cause this.  I would definitely recommend that you see your cardiologist again now that you are having edema, especially since it sounds like your symptoms began after a change in your medications.  I would also recommend you follow up with your primary care doctor to further evaluate the cause of your edema.  Sometimes people do have to live with this but this is generally becuase the cause is known but treatment is simply not effective enough.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 24 year old male in fair shape. I work out 5 days a week, eat decent and have normal cholesterol levels. Everything started about 2 years ago, suddenly one day out of nowhere my heart started racing and i could not catch my breath, id say that it normally only lasts for less than 3 seconds. I can go for months without it happening, and then all of a sudden it will hit me. Today was an exceptionally scary case because it lasted for almost 30 seconds or more, my heart felt out of control, it was beating so hard that it now feels like it is hurting from the strain, and i had very short breath. Also when this happens i zone out and everything feels weird while it is happening. Grandfather on my mothers side had double or triple bypass (cant remember) at a fairly young age, other than that no history of family heart problems. My grandfather is still alive and well in his mid 80's. Doctor told me its common and nothing to worry about, but never gave me an EKG or anything of the sort. I do unfortunately have a history of drug use including ecstasy and many OTC drugs such as DXM, dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine, and many other non otc drugs. I do not consume alcohol on a regular basis nor have i ever smoked cigarettes. Just wondering if this is something I should insist on getting checked?

    "title": "Re: Sudden racing heart, shortness of breath, very random",
    "content": "Hello --  One thing you didn't make clear in your post: is your history of drug use current or something in the past? This is significant because many of the drugs you mentioned can cause this sort of thing, and if that's the case, then yes, this could represent  a dangerous situation. If you're no longer using any of these drugs then they are probably not the cause and you may be experiencing brief runs of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), a generally benign but often disruptive arrhythmia which can become more persistent with time, especially if there is a congenital abnormality of the atrioventricular node (AVNRT is the name of the defect). While  this is common and generally benign, if the episodes become either too frequent or last hours at a time (and this does seem to be getting more persistent), it can be cured permanently in many cases by a minimally invasive procedure known as radio frequency ablation (RFA).   Given the fact that you experience \"greyouts\" with this suggests it's probably SVT, and this may be due to an abnormality that can be  corrected as described above. If so, it's well worth it to never have to worry about it again. This may also be a flukey SVT that some people have for no apparent reason. It's still not \"normal\" and can be managed medically, with any one of several fairly innocuous drugs. If your doctor isn't interested in even following through on an exam to determinie if this may be the case, then you should be seen by a cardiologist in order to clear up any doubts and find out what your management options are. If you're still doing the drugs you mentioned (any of them) you'll need to stop this ASAP, as they can cause far more serious arrhythmias that might feel the same as what's been discussed here and can also cause actual damage to the heart muscle. So that needs to be removed from the equation first of all. Then if this continues, follow up with an interested doctor, because chances are it's simple and benign and can actually be eliminated or at least controlled medically.  I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck to you with this. Please follow up with us here as need.\n\n",

I am a new nurse, so I know just enough that I'm scaring myself, but not enough to know what's really going on.  I have woken up twice at night with my chest burning and my arms and legs tingling. I thought I was having an anxiety attack, but my pulse never increased. It actually got weaker and then normalized.  I know that PVC's are normal, and I expected the tachycardia because of my stress level. But the bradycardia is throwing me off. All of my blood tests came back normal and my thyroid is normal.  I do have an appointment with a cardiologist, but it takes some time to get in to see dr's as I'm sure you know, so all I'm doing now is worrying. Do you have any idea what is going on?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  You know what they say about a little knowlege being a dangerous thing. It can also, however, be a useful thing. Sometimes it's difficult to be sure. Now, everything you've described would seem normal and stress-related except possibly the slow heart rate. What isn't clear is if this happens at specific times or just randomly. If it happens in the evening, when fatigued or sleepy or resting, or early in the AM, it could just be normal vagatonic response exaggerated slightly, especially if you are very physically fit.   There is, as you probably know, a condition, fariry rare, called sick sinus syndrome (SSS) in which heart rate alternates randomly between very slow and rather fast (and often in a-fib). While this is very unlikely and usually happens in much older people than you, since you'll be seeing a cardiolgist in a bit, it would be a good question to raise. Since you are a new nurse you are constantly learning new things and also experiencing things that are new. You might consider your cardio consult an edcuational opportunity as well as a way to likely ease your mind about what's been going on.   I very seriously doubt SSS, strongly suspect vasovagal stimulation, possibly dyasutonomia (not a serious issue but often an upsetting one), but the cardio doctor will be able to rule any of this in/out fairly easily. Meanwhile I would just take note of things, when they happen, and try to connect any dots, as much of this may be situational and not anything at all to be concerned about. Since I haven't seen an EKG of yours I wouldn't want to just cavalierly tell you \"there's nothing wrong,\" but if I were a betting type I'd put my money on that.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up here as needed and by all means update us after your cardiology visit. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: irregular heartbeats due to upper body positions",
    "content": "Hello --  This isn't as unusual as you might think. Many people are, due to variations  in anatomy from one person to the next, more prone to premature beats and even runs or group beating, owing to position. Lying on one side or the other in bed, bending forward at the waist, and stooping or squatting, can often serve as triggers, but this, like everything else involving extrasystoles, will  vary from time to time, depending on many trivial  factors.   One thing is fairly certain: you haven't brought this about by compressing a nerve. While  nerve tissue is certainly involved, it is cardiac nerve tissue which can't be  compressed or pinched, but only reacts to internal \"touching.\"   One possible variation on this theme is the possibility of a structural abnormality such as mitral valve prolapse (MVP) or a thickened left ventricle or septum (myocardial hypertrophy, which is often seen in bodybuilders and athletes). To rule out this remote possibility (and the premature beats associated with these things are only incidental, not diagnostic nor more ominous in these settings) you only need an echoardiogram, a non-invasive test that takes 15 or 20 minutes to perform and visualizes the internal structures of the heart. I strongly feel all athletes and fitness buffs should have this done anyway. If it's normal (or not grossly abnormal, since many of us have trivial variations on the basic blueprint) then this is just something that will eventually fade into the background most likely. If it won't there's always beta blocker therapy if it starts to really bother you, but most doctors will try to avoid prescribing anything because it's almost always only to treat something intermittent and inconsequential. Some people will benefit from this, though, because of intense anxiety caused by very frequent premature beats.   I hope this is helpful. The act of position changing in itself isn't harmful but you may feel somewhat inhibited at times. Try to walk through this,  if you can, as it will  help desensitize the touchy areas. Good luck to you and please follow up with  us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Premature beats can be very disturbing to the person having them, but they are essentially benign, aren't diagnostic nor prognostic of anything (especially in light of a clean bill of heart health) but can drive a person crazy. They are very unpleasant feeling, can generate a lot of anxiety, and this anxiety produces more adrenaline, which in turn triggers more \"skipped\" beats. You say you drink a lot of soda: is this cola primarily? Anything with caffeine in it will tend to aggravate these skips, and it's not just colas (Mountain Dew, Dr. Pepper, Red Bull, etc. also have a lot of caffeine in them). Everyone (believe this or not) has a certain number of skipped or premature beats, and some people just aren't very aware of them, while others feel every single one. Also, the tend to come and go over time, with periods when you'll have a lot and other times when they totally disappear.   The sodas may be a big factor in this, though. If you're consuming much caffeine you'll just have more premature beats. Cutting down (or out) caffeine will sometimes make a big difference. Sometimes not. Depends. Usually it will help.   I hope this answers your concerns. It's all pretty normal, but it's hard to put up with it. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here if you have any further questions.\n\n",

    "content": "dear doctor,  i'm 20 F, diagnosed with Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia early this year, although i've been having heart issues since august. in august, i had a holter test done because i had been in the er with a hr of 140 resting. i attribute this episode to a stressful time in my life, which is making me think that this whole IST issue started around then, as no doctor before thought my resting hr was too high. anyway, the holter showed that my average hr was 96bpm. my hr was then about 84-88 resting. i had an echo, blood tests, etc, and everything was normal. i was given atenolol, and gradually my dose was increased. now i take 50mg in the morning, 25mg at night (i weigh 120lbs). the last holter i had done, a few weeks ago, showed an average bpm of 78, with the highest being 120, and the lowest being 60. i think that as far as hr is concerned, i'm feeling a lot better. before i had a lot of PVCs; the test showed about 20, but i only felt two.  my concern is that before i was on the atenolol, my blood pressure was around 110/70, normal range. now though (i actually had my bp checked today) it is 90/58; sometimes it can get up to 100/70 if i'm upset. i'm really concerned about this because i think that having such a low blood pressure is causing some symptoms. my feet are freezing all the time, to the touch, and sometimes i get this burning sensation in them. my toes can turn purplish too. and my fingernails are deep pink always, and sometimes turn purplish. when i take my temperature, it's usually between 96.7-98. i'm concerned when its in the 96 range because i feel freezing even though the room is fine (heat on, etc). this usually happens at night, after i take my night dose. also, i feel short of breath, like i need to take bigger breaths sometimes. i'm afraid the low bp is causing this.  and i don't know if this is correlated, but i also think that the low bp is causing me to gain weight? around this time last year, i weighed about 110lbs.; now i weigh 120, and am trying to lose some weight but i can't. i just feel like my metabolism is slowing down because of lack of proper blood flow.  any opinion you can give me would be greatly appreciated; i hope you can answer my questions. i'm pretty troubled over these symptoms, and want to talk to my dr (or get a second opinion) about switching medications, or even reevaluating the IST diagnosis.  again, thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: atenolol side effect questions",
    "content": "Hi  there --  Well this is interesting. First, while the IST diagnosis may have been technically correct, it sounds as though it was situational, which is not unusual. Sometimes this can be triggered by a stressful event or prolonged stress, and then takes a while  to self-correct. It seems the Holter  results were actually well within normal limits,  so you may have by then started to normalize. The atenolol may have been a little premature -- in my humble opinion.   Then there's the issue of side effects. What you describe sounds fairly typical for certain people to certain beta blockers. Atenolol seems to cause these side effects more than some other, newer (though not that  new) beta blockers. For instance, many people who react badly to atenolol can tolderate slow-release  metaprolol with much less annoying side effects. Technically any beta blocker should have the same side effects, but the very fact there are so many on  the market is because the side effects to vary greatly from person to person. Metaprolol seems to have the best overall tolerability, but it also may be you don't  need the drug at all.   The low blood pressure is not a problem in and of itself: If it works for you at lower levels, then it's fine. In other words,  again, there is a range of tolerability. If a person can get up and walk and function with a BP of 80/40, then it works for that person. If it causes symptoms  (lightheadedness, lethargy, etc.), then it's not working well. Your BP is on the low side of normal, and if you feel ok in general, that's great. However, you have cold extremities, and this is another problem with some beta blockers, as they can cause vasoconstriction of small vessels in the skin and cause cold hands and feet, bluishness, etc. The can slow the metabolism enough to mke you feel pretty sluggish and almost like someone with hypthyroidism. Not real pleasant. Weight gain -- or inability  to lose weight -- is also typical of some  members of this drug family. Again, if a beta blocker is needed, a different one is probably in order. Atenolol  is not being tolerated well. Some doctors will tell you they're all the same,  but the fact is theoretically they should be but in fact thay are not, and there are significant differences depending upon the individual user.  So then: you're not tolerating the beta blocker well, and either need to be weaned off it or have it changed. Your symptoms are clasic for certain beta blockers. You may not need the  drug at all, and your IST may have been situational. You've had a comprehensive cardiac workup and are essentially fine, but my have an autonomic nervous system imbalance, and if that can be determined, you may need medication to manage it, but this seems falrly unlikely given the information you've provided.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Male, 49 yo, mild MVP (no regurgitation). 10 years ago, after stressful period (marriage, 1st child), began suffering from PVC's, mostly resting, worse when heart rate went up. My exercise tolerance has always been very low. ECGs, Holter (256 PVC's per 24 hours), echos & treadmill (few PAC's), all normal. Quit caffeine, Colas, tea etc & had been almost totally PVC free since!  Over the last 3 months (another stressful situation at home), I noticed that when I walked vigorously I got few extra beats (felt like PVC's). Slowing my pace and heart rate down, made extra beats disappear. Following a week of Clarithromycin a month & a half ago, I got significantly more PAC's that lasted a couple of weeks after the antibiotic was stopped. Some of my PVC's came back, but mostly it was PAC's (no Holter, just my feeling). 10 days ago, I started exercising on recumbent bike for 45 minutes daily. When I get my heart rate in aerobic zone (120-137), I get a few extra beats (that feel like PVC's). When I walk vigorously, even downhill, only a couple of mins into the walk, I get quite a few PVC's that scare me and I reduce tempo to get heart rate down. These forceful PVCs that occur with physical exertion are definitely a NEW SYMPTOM for me.  Cardiologist performed ECG & Doppler heart echo (w/ sounding of carotid & stomach arteries) that were normal. Heart dimensions were exactly same to those of echo 10 years ago (performed by same physician), of importance because I am mildly hypertensive (145/95 morning, 135/85 afternoon, 125/80 when relaxed). Cardio doc did NOT suggest that I do treadmill test due to relatively low cholesterol (189) and absence of heart disease in paternal & maternal parents and said that a hypertensive patient is more likely to receive a false positive result & \"unnecessary extra testing\".  Does it sound like the ectopic beats I get when my heart rate goes up may be attributed to CAD? May they be caused by mild MVP? In light of testing carried out, might a more serious condition such as ARVD may be in the making? Is anxiety causing them (\"Oh my God, I am going to get them again\") when I start walking vigorously? Should I have a treadmill test?  Thank you very kindly for this forum and your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: PVCs during physical exertion",
    "content": "Hello -  Here's the deal with ectopic heartbeats (and especially in the setting of MVP): while the conventional wisdom (and most common scenario) is that PVCs occur at rest and disappear with exercise, there is no hard and fast  rule about that. With MVP there are more PVCs and PACs than there would likely be otherwise in many patients. It is extremely difficult to tell, subjectively, when we are feeling PVCs, PACs or a combo. Sometimes, if one is way too somatically oriented, it can be done, but even then half the time one would be wrong.   Further: those 256 PVCs on your Holter monitor recording are really unremarkable. Truly.   PVCs, in the absence of structural or organic heart disease (with marked left ventricular dysfunction) are of no significance whatsoever. Neither are PACs unless you start getting runs of them lasting for minutes to hours, in which case you have a whole different (and still not terrible, but much more disturbing) problem.  That doesn't appear to be the case.  Many people,  especially when stressed, will develop premature beats (PVCs and/or PACs) or even accellerated idioventricular rhythm (which tends to be regular but feels like something's not right) during exercise, which seems wrong and can quite often interrupt exercise due to the unpleasantness of the sensation. It still doesn't mean anything, however.   So far, so good. It seems unlikely your PVCs and PACs are due to CAD, since they will occur in the average subject whether or not there is any CAD present, and even if there is, again, they are of no prognostic significance. So you can't really use those as any kind of indicator of anything except, perhaps, the level of stress in your life at any given moment.  The only thing I would fault is the choice of your doctor to not perform a stress test (and, in fact, a nuclear scan with stress test would be the ideal). You're at the right age to warrant this, and with the nuclear scan any elevated BP artifact would be irrelevant. The test would ease your mind considerably, most likely,  even if it did uncover some unlikely CAD (which would  be what we call \"occult\", since it is quite hidden, having no symptoms -- the ectopic beats do not count as a possible symptom). I personally feel you -- and your cardiologist -- would benefit from a nuclear scan/stress test, because it would ease the pressure on both of you. If  your cardiologist refuses to yield on this one you might want to consider a second opinion or change of specialist, as there are many out there who would be more than happy to spend the time to lay this to rest once and for all.  All  that said, the ectopy, when it is perceptible, can be pretty disturbing,  but it is harmless -- and meaningless. I hope this is helpful to you and please do follow up with us as needed, especially if you have any further questions or would like to add any information. Good luck to you.\n\n",

The test found around 120 PACs, 4 of them in bigeminy, and 14 isolated polymorphic PVCs. My heart rate ranged from 48 to 151. No ischemic changes were observed. The doctor considered the results to be very good.  I am a bit less concerned in light of these results BUT I am seeing another cardiologist next week and I will request that he consider sending me for a nuclear stress test.

    "content": "My son had SVT in utero which resulted in hydrops.  He was born prematurely at 30 weeks.  When this was discovered on ultrasound I was started on digoxin and solatol (I think).  I was taking these meds for approx. 5 days before  his birth.  During these five days he cardioverted into normal heart rhythm for short (maybe 15min.) stints, but really cardioverted while I was in labor (more normal rhythm than tachy).  I was told he would not survive, but he is now almost three mo. old with all hydrops resolved and SVT has been controlled with digoxin.  He had a few breakthroughs in the NICU that were mostly resolved with OG tube vagal, but once with adenosine.  No breakthroughs since a few weeks old.  We were told that he may grow out of whatever was causing the SVT.  My questions are: what percentage of kids with SVT in utero/neonate do grow out of this condition?  How many have to have abalation?  At what age do they grow out of it?  If he doesn't grow out of it when will they do abalation?  Thanks for the info.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  First of all congratulations on the new addition and on his having made it out of the woods. It should be easier from here on out.   I have no idea what the statistics are on outgrowing this, but my guess would be it's a fairly low number, since it's probably caused by an atrioventricular nodal re-entry tract (AVNRT), which is a congenital abnormality that many children grow into instead of out of. However, since he's so small, as he grows, the redundant nerve tissue could separate, which would be a sort of home-grown ablation. If not, then the potential for ablation will probably depend upon how big a problem the arrhythmia causes later on. It will later be more amenable to less noxious drugs, and then, at puberty, if not sooner, ablation would be the ultimate solution to the problem.   I'd only be guessing at statistics (and have had a great deal of difficulty finding any to point to), but probably would think about a one in three likelihood of outgrowing it.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and again congratulations. Please keep us updates as to your son's progress.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I\u2019m a 41 year old male, 5\u201910 and 200lbs.  I\u2019ve suffered from palpitations as far back as I can remember (maybe about 12 years old).  It all started after one of my soccer games.  I was about 12 or 13 years old and I noticed a very rapid but steady heart beat.  I new it was not normal and my parents thought it was just my heart rate beating high because I just played.  It eventually went away.  I suffered maybe 6 more of these rapid beats within the next few years but was always too scared to tell anyone or seek medical attention (I know, I was dumb). It seemed if I would try to burp or try to mimic a bowel movement that would reset my heart to normal rhythm.   I finally went to my family doctor and was giving a whole battery of tests (holter monitor, echo cardiogram, etc...). Some PAC and PVC\u2019s were detected but that\u2019s all.  They put me on the beta-blocker Nadolol 20mg and gave me Xanex (for what they said was anxiety).  I\u2019ve tested negative for MVP a couple times, but if you read some of my triggers they are consistent with symptoms of MVP (any thoughts?)  I\u2019ve been taking Nadolol for about 20 years now and don\u2019t recall having anymore of those rapid heart beat attacks, but the PAC\u2019s and PVC\u2019s have been with me ever since.  On average, I only get a couple a day, but it\u2019s enough to drive me crazy.  I do see a cardiologist every six months and been but on holter monitors, loop monitors, stress tests, echo\u2019s and everything comes back normal.  These palps have been taking over my life and giving me anxiety.  I will list some of my irregular heartbeat triggers below and please tell me what is or what is not normal.  Also, can you please explain how I would feel the difference between a PAC and PVC and runs of them?  -\tat times when I\u2019m hungry -\tat times when I had a big meal or drank too many fluids (non-alcohol) -\ttake a deep breath -\tlay on my left side (almost always get a palp.) -\texercise -\tbending over (can be a big trigger) -\tsudden move or kneel down -\tI can always feel my heart beat (I\u2019m aware of it at all times \u2013 normal rhythm or irregular) \u2013 being so anxious about it I might of tuned myself to it. -\tWhen I burp -\tWhen I sniff (like if I have a runny nose) -\tIf I get really excited (argument, sexual intercourse \u2013 they are one after the other!) -\tGassy or bloated Thanks for your help!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is it V-Tac or PAT?",
    "content": "Hello --  When I read the heading I thought this might be a difficult  post to answer. As it turns out it's not. The question in the heading refers to the accelerated heart rate you experienced when quite young. Based on the fact that your attemps at burping and/or straining \"reset\" the rhythm tells us that you successfully broke an accelerated heart rate by use of Valsalva maneuver, which will only work with supraventricular tachycardias (SVT) and not with V-tach. So that part is answered.  Now then: regarding MVP, while it is not always possible to diagnose actual redundant mitral leaflet or floppy valve, the syndrome which sometimes accompanies it is pretty classic, and is often referred to as MVPS even when there is no diagnosis of MVP. Some centers call it dysautonomia. Whatever the label, the symptoms are the same, and are often associated with anxiety (chicken or egg is the big question here), and this does tend to make us tune in more acutely to what our bodies are doing.  Now then: your list of triggers. This could have been taken from a book on PVCs,  as every one is a classic and typical trigger for occasional PVCs. Every single one. And they are all innocent and benign. Further, PVCs (and PACs) are harmless and not diagnostic of anything. They will happen to a greater or lesser extent in various people for any number of reasons, and will become very frequent or go away spontaneously. Anxiety always makes them become more frequent and can cause them to continue on when otherwise they might disappear. We all have them to a greater or lesser extent. They can, as you note, be crazy-making,  but they are benign anyway, other than the anxiety they cause and consequent worry and self-imposed limitations. This is where the problem comes in, as they are difficult to ignore.  Some doctors are willing to go with a trial of a low-dose beta blocker such  as metaprolol to help reduce symptoms, and sometimes also an antianxiety med such as clonazepam, to help break the cycle of anxiety caused by the irregular beats. Then again, some won't prescribe anything. Hopefully it can be managed without medication,  but when this doesn't work, the above combination is often very effective.   You're normal as the day is long. I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with  us here as needed. Good luck to  you.\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome and I'm glad my reply and the other posts have been helpful to  you. If the result has been fewer PVCs then the thing largely  speaks for itself.  When you get a run, however brief (and don't they all seem a lot longer than they actually are?), chances are it's atrial, and SVT, not A-fib, although even \"normal\" hearts can have an occasional brief burst of A-fib. If it continues for hours or days you'll know something different is happening and should then be seen urgently to convert it if possible, since the one big problem with sustained A-fib is the potential for stroke. But it's unlikely to happen in your case, as you are very typical/ normal in what you describe. There's also no particular reason to fear a sudden,  for-no-reason run of V-tach, which is a direct function of a diseased left ventricle and severe left heart failure. If you had this you'd have enough other problems that the arrhythmias would seem trivial in comparision to how bad you'd feel. Runs of SVT are possible, and the bearing down (Valsalva maneuver) should always be your first response. It often works. If you should ever find yourself with an episode of this you can't break on your own, just go to the nearest ER, where they'll convert it with a shot of adenosine. It's pretty simple, really, not life-threatening, just not very pleasant. But the  anticipation of the possible is often much worse than the playing out of the merely likely. So if that does happen, do whatever seems most likely to make you  feel better first.   I'm really gratified that you've gotten so much from reading posts here on the site. That's why we're here. Good luck to you and please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: PVC/PAC Couplet vs. Run...",
    "content": "Hi there --  This is  an easy question to answer, yet difficult. You'll see. FIrst, the difference between a couplet and a run is one beat (or more). A couple is two in a row without a break or normal beat in between. A run is technically three or more. That was the easy part.  What's more difficult is to tell the perceived difference between a PAC and PVC. Depending upon the timing, they can feel the same and both can feel quite different depending on timing and area of origin. So generally we consider that they feel the same. Usually they do, at least for practical purposes. Further, a three or four beat run of either can feel the same and both are quite common in young, healthy people. Runs of more than three or four are most often (statistically) atrial beats. In the absence of any structural heart disease neither has much diagnostic nor prognostic significance.  Bloating, gas, GI upset, etc., as well as slowing down and nearing sleep (along with a lot of other innocent factors) can cause or predispose to both isolated and paired premature beats (usually ventricular) and runs. The list of benign causes is as long as your arm.   The act of rolling over onto one's side (usually the left, sometimes the right) can often bring the stomach into close enough contact with the heart to trigger and/or make these events much more noticeable. It generally means nothing, but it can  feel creepy at the least.  I hope this helps answer your concerns. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: My heart speeds up for no reason",
    "content": "Hi there --  First, you're not too young to have a heart problem, especially given the really bad family history you have. If it weren't for that I'd maybe drop the urgency down a notch,  but you're also correct about radiating pains, and the fact your heart speeds up at times may or may not be related to this, and may actually be not very important compared with the other things you've mentioned.  Still, in this instance, I think it would be worthwhile to name every symptom you've listed here, and arrange to be evaluated by a cardiologist -- and I would advise you of this even if you weren't having symptoms, because of family history. You need to have at least a baseline cardiological picture of your heart's health. If nothing's wrong, that's great. You are at greater risk than others would be due to the history in your family, so the baseline workup gives doctors a reference, a benchmark to compare with in the future should you develop probelms later on.  So yes, given all you've told us, I would definitely get things checked out, hope for the best, but reocognize that bad family history is one of the biggest risk factors and the only thing you can do to offset it is to know what's going on so you can be proactive if need be.   Best of luck to you with this. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: unresolved heart skipping maybe induced by nicotine",
    "content": "Hi Chad,  What you've describing is classic for common premature ventricular contractions  (PVCs). These are very hard sometimes to catch on Holter monitor (although an event recorder sometimes will have better luck) because they tend to come and go at random,  although they can come and stay for a while, then go away for long periods (or at least go unnoticed). The timing of these is one reason they sometimes seem so different, so pronounced and almost painful and seem to momentarily take one's breath away. If one happens right when the pulmonary valve is closed it will be a lot more noticeable, but in all cases they are benign and not diagnostic of anything in particular. They may sometimes lead to an exam which discovers a problem, but when this happens  it's almost always a coincidence. Since you have a family history of valve problems you'd probably be wise to have an echocardiogram before you report for duty, just so you'll be sure there's no significant structural problem (and there probably isn't, at least based on the symptoms you describe). There are many many things that can trigger PVCs, and high up on that list is nicotine (also caffeine, stress, fatigue,  sitting quietly -- yes, they're more likely then -- etc.). Since military life is inherently more stressful than normal life, there's a possibility you'll have more of these, but you'll  also be consistently active, which may keep them down or make them go away most of the time. We all get them to a greater or lesser extent, Smoking definitely increases them. Caffeine too. So my best advice would be to rule out any possible valve problems, and if there are none, then accept PVCs as a part of life and soon you'll be too focused on other things to notice them much, most likely.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you and  please let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "title": "A-Fib reverted w.Flecainide but now chest pain, bloating...",
    "content": "I am a 32 yr old male. Fit and healthy, running and gym training 3 times a week. Non smoker, social drinker.  In Dec 2005 I had A-Fib after snorkeling in cold water (something that I have done a hundred times before without incident). My heart did not race. It staying roughly between 60 and 80. I reverted after 24 hours on Solotol. Post reversion EKG, Stress test, echo were normal and I was described as having a completely normal and healthy heart. No further treatment was perscribed.  Since then I get the odd fluttery beat and the odd localised chest pain.  Last week (Apr 2009) after a treadmill interval training session I ended up in A-fib. Again my heart did not race and stayed around 60-80. Different hospital and the drug of the moment seems to be Flecainide. I reverted in 24 hours. Post reversion EKG, Stress test, echo again were normal... although my heart fluttered twice during the stress test (doctor said this was normal and the important thing is that the flutter did not keep going).  Since the first incident I have had to approach cold water with caution, often splashing myself and entering slowly. Now I feel like I have to approach exercise with the same caution (something which I am unhappy about). As a result I was told to continue Flecanide for the next 4 weeks and then return for a follow up. However, I have been getting chest pains - sometimes seemingly dependent on how I am sitting, sometimes constantly over the whole day level 1/10 pain, sometimes sharp stabbing, jolting pain maybe 7/10 and shortness of breath. Catch 22 makes me anxious about the chest pain which may be making it worse??? I have also noted bloating and excessive gas and trapped wind.  Quick aside: I have anal fissures but they have not been linked to Crohn's or any other disease.  I have been to see a cardiologist who conducted EKG, Stress test, Echo and again could find nothing structurally wrong. He stopped the Flcainide. He was not able to perscribe an alternative as Beta Blockers, Flecainide and another he suggested all tend to lower heart rates and I have a resting heart rate of around 50-55 naturally. I am going to have a 24 hour monitor next week.  I am left knowing there is something wrong, something causing the chest pain but don't know what and after 2 visits don't expect to find out from a cardiologist. I feel like I am treading on egg shells with everything I do not just getting in cold water or onto a treadmill as I don't want it to happen again. I have an appointment with a naturopath tomorrow night and will keep the appointment with the hospital to follow-up in 3 weeks.  Thanks in advance for any help. Happy to answer any further questions.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  There are several features of your complaint that are interesting. FIrst, atrial fibrillation is often triggered, in susceptible individuals, by immersion in cold water, for reasons not entirely clear. Further, this arrhythmia will often present with chest pain (of an atypical sort such as you describe), especially in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP). However, in a young, otherwise healthy person, Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome or a related one, is often the underlying cause. Have you been seen by an electrophysiologist for this? Have you had an EP test to determine the origin of the arrhythmia? Such studies will often lead to discovery of an accessory pathway or irritable focus in the atria, which can be ablated via radio frequency at the time of the study,  often with no further problems. I would aggressively seek a consult with a cardiologist who is an  EP specialist, as these doctors are deeply involved in the  study of arrhythmias and can often go straight to the underlying cause, and if it is WPW, there is often a classic EKG feature which will give it away.   Your  relatively slow regular  rate is probably due to your fitness level, and if so then use of a beta blocker really won't drive it much lower, so that's not really a good argument against use of this type of med. However, there are often other ways of getting rid of this sort of problem (EP study/ablation) and this should be explored. There is also a very rare (in your age group) problem known as sick sinus syndrome (SSS) which should be ruled out as well. In this condition there is an alternation between a very slow sinus bradycardia and atrial fibrillation. This  should be explored even though it is unlikely at your age.   Hopefully this is somewhat helpful. Please follow up with us as needed, and if there is any addtional information you can add, that would be helpful.  Also keep us updated as to any changes or anything new coming to light. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "John  Thanks for a quick and detailed response. It's great to have some definite questions to ask the cardiologist I am due to see in a couple of weeks. The cardiologist I have seen was reluctant to suggest RF Ablation. He said that there wasn't enough data to support it's success rates (possibly with my symptoms and ECG results) added to that the risk associated with the procedure.  I will find out if I can be seen by an EP specialist.  - Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome and Sick sinus syndrome are on the list to definitely ask them about. - MVP > I presume (having had all the usual tests that this would have been obvious and diagnosed at the time.

    "title": "PAC's in bigeminy.",
    "content": "Hi,       I have recently found this forum and would very much like the help of John Kenyon. I am in the UK, am 54 and have had for the past 15 years episodic PAC's which have come and gone down the years. I have them when I am unwell or stressed or eat challenging foods. For the past three years I have been taking 80mg sotalol am and 80mg pm, usually twelve hours apart. Twelve weeks ago after flu the pattern of the PAC's changed considerably and I am now in almost constant bigeminy or trigeminy, the only relief I have is when I sit down or lay down to sleep. I have called our paramedics out and they have captured the arrythmia on a strip, and I have been seen in the local cardio clinic in arrythmia aswell. The registrar diagnosed PAC's and said that they were nothing to worry about, he wanted me to have a treadmill test, no echo as I had one three years ago, and to change to cardicor once the stress test was complete. I have had a 48 hr monitor in the last week which captured my arrythmia, and also the treadmill test, as yet I have not received my results. I am due back at clinic in late May. I tried 2.5mg of cardicor for four days but had an unpleasant reaction to it; low BP as in 80/55, slow and very irregular heartrate and shaking and dizziness. My GP discontinued it and put me back on sotalol again. I am very frightened as the pattern of my life has completely changed, as soon as I am on my feet in the morning the arrythmia returns and only stops when I lay down at night. My GP suggested that the sotalol is perhaps not effective and said to stop taking it so for three days I have cut my dose by half, but all day today I have had a heart rate of over 100 which has been in bigeminy relentlessly all day and I am at my wits end. I am sitting now and all is settled and quiet and I would not know there was anything wrong. I am terrified of walking around, or exerting myself unduly in any way. When I had the treadmill test last week, the PAC's disappeared when my heart rate reached 140 but I found the whole thing so frightening that I couldn't go on with it for the full required length of the test. Although menopausal and taking simvastatin, my general health is okay, I am not overweight, avoid all the triggers for arrythmia as much as possible, and I also accept that this situation is causing anxiety that is possibly making the situation worse. I am worried that the doctors are missing something vital, can't understand why my heart rhythm is so out of kilter. I am told I should not have symptoms, but as soon as bigeminy begins, I am disorentated and nauseous and out of breath. Please can someone help at all ? I am verging on desperate. Thank you for your time. Kindest wishes.  Julie.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: PAC's in bigeminy.",
    "content": "Hello Julie--  First, while the presentation you describe is fairly unusual, it is far from unheard of, and absent any structural heart disease it is not, in and of itself, dangerous. However, that doesn't account for the tremendous degree of anxiety and general discomfort it can cause. Why some people have just random PACs while others have them in group beating patterns such as bigemeny is unclear, but the result is the same, and when the problem is aggravated by movement or exertion, there is usually some obscure structural abnormality that is responsible. Again, though not dangerous, this will definitely cause most people to feel inhibited about their activities and this  leads to deconditioning, anxiety and more premature beats.  You may have had a normal echocardiogram three years ago, but that's hardly reason to pass on one now. Things can be missed and things can have changed.  Some of the possibilites are mitral valve prolapse, which can often be missed (quite legitimately) on a given day, while visualized on another; and a more unusual abnormality often responsible for frequent PACs, which is known by the alarming (but misleading) term atrial septal aneurysm. This is not an aneurysm in the sense we normally think of one, but rather a failure of the tissues of the atrial septum to fully merge together prior to birth. The gap that's left in the space between often places stress on the  fibers trailing off the sinus node, causing freqent PACs or even supraventricular tachycardia. This can also be missed on regular  echo and sometimes requires a transesohphageal echocardiogram (TEE) to be visualised. It's an off-chance, but since your problem  is so frequent and consistent, there is a greater likelihood of some structural abnormality. Of course the best way to get to the bottom of this would be to arrange a consult with an electrophysiologist  (if you haven't already done this). An EP specialist is much more likely to pick out clues that could lead to identifying the problem.   The Sotolol prescription doesn't seem especially wise, honestly, as this is mostly effective against atrial  fibrilliation, and whoever told  you you shouldn't have symptomstoms obviously hasn't experienced this problem. You are very likely to have symptoms, even though they are benign. The are still extremely unpleasant.   While anxiety really will usually only make the symptoms worse,it's pretty difficult to control andxiety while the problem  continues happening with no medical help.  The cardiocor probably wasn't a great idea either, and I'm wondering why a regular beta blocker has not been tried (something like metaprolol,  for instance).   Extremely frequent PACs, whether in group patterns or randomly appearing, are both common and very unpleasant. They are not serious in themselves,but there i s no reason why you shouldn't begiven every opportunity to live free of most of this aggravation. A regular beta blocker and a consult with an EP specailist may well help resolve most, if not all of the problem. We all weill have some of this happen  from time to time throughout our lives, but this is excessive and you deserve a better, more thoroug workup by a subspecialist who may well be able to resolve this for you or at least make it much more tolerable.   Please follow up with us here as needed and hang in there. This can also get better spontaneously. Good  luck to you and please keep us updated.\n\n",

I can just about tolerate the sotalol and the cardicor was a disaster, I did worry the out-of-hours GP that came to the house, my BP was so low, but I was okay within a couple of days. I am frightened to do without the sotalol completely, but that is anxiety  realise that. I don' know how to get an echo as they have said a definite no to that, I feel in my heart of hearts that something must have changed to create this non-stop arrythmia, but without prompt medical assistance I am unable to begin to resolve this. All I can say for now is thank you for getting back to me, I will contact my GP and try and get something more definitive done. Kind regards to you John.  Julie.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Skipping beats; short of breath at all times",
    "content": "Hello --  The palpitations themselves are generally of no importance -- except to the person feeling them. The fact that there are lots more than usual now, along with some shortness of breath, could mean several things, most of them pretty innocent. Here's what could be happening:  1) If for some reason (often stress, anxiety, sleep deprivation, caffeine intake, etc.) the premature beats become frequent, they can become also timed, almost ineveitably (and especially if they occur in the pattern of bigemeny, where every other beat is a premature one -- your resting EKG already showed some trigemeny, so you are prone to group beating like this, which is innocent but can be pretty alarming to feel) so as to fire when the pulmonary valve is still closed. This isn't how it's supposed to happen, but it's bound to at times. When this happens it causes both a reflux of blood back into the jugular veins, causing an unpleasant pulsing (cannon A-waves) in the jugulars (felt in the neck, sometimes even in the scalp) and some intermittent shortness of breath while it's going on. This will tend to come and go, but the more frequent the premature beats, the more it will be noticed. It can even produce some vague feelings of pain or pressure across the front of the chest, but is not affected by exertion. This is the most likely explanation; 2) People with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) are more prone to this sort of thing, and it can remain quiet for years, til some upsetting event or stressful period seems to trigger it. The subesquent anxiety keeps things hopping, unfortunately. Usually a beta blocker like metaprolol will help, but on occasion either the dose is too low to be effective (what is yours?) or, in rare cases, since slowing of the heart rate can set off lots of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) the slowing caused by the beta blocker actually opens the door for more of this. I suspect in your case probably too low a dose is more likely; 3) There is a role often played by menopause in this. While you are fairly young yet for that, you could be premenopausal, and just about any hormonal change can trigger PVCs and other harmless arrhythmias.   The biggest challenge is convincing the patient these palpitations are not dangerous, although they can be very, very upsetting. They are rarely predictive or diagnostic of anything, and in and of themselves will not cause any harm. They can be associated with other conditions that can be more troublesome, but they are more or less incidental to any of these and are very common in general.   I'd be remiss if I didn't at leastmention the smoking issue. There, it's been mentioned. Enough said.  If the shortness of breath is really pronounced and happens upon even slight exertion you should at least have an echocardiogram to rule out any unusual structural probelms with the heart which, while unusual, can certainly occur and can cause this sort of symptompolgy. It would be wrong to dismiss the whole thing out of hand, even though this is usualy an innocent and temporary situation. I would persue it if only for your own peace of mind. An echo whould be totally appropriate and your doctor should be willing to do this to help clear the air. Also, a pulmonary function test might be useful to assess lung capacity, since you do smoke, even though not as much as some.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,    I have just found this forum ths morning, am in UK. Reading the doctor's response to the original post has helped me immensely in the middle of near constant trigeminy for me. I am 54 and have been prone to isolated PAC's for ten years, but for the past three months I have been moreor less in constant arrythmia. I have had a 48 hr holter monitor this week and a treadmill test ( results still unknown ) and am finding the heart being always out of kilter so very difficult to manage. I am relatively ok when at rest, but as soon as I stand or walk around the PAC's come every two or three beats and only stop when I sit down again. The treadmill test took my pulse to 141 and they all disappeared and I was totally free of them for five hours afterwards before they returned with force. I have been sitting here awake all night with PAC's every three beats. I have a daughter who is severely disabled and I look after her now full time. She is 21 and beautiful and needs oxygen overnight so I have to be wakeful to check her. Earlier this year she had pneumonia for five weeks and I was very frightened but managed to keep her and nurse her at home. After she improved I began with this constant arrythmia and I long for it to stop or at least to settle a little bit. I take sotalol twice a day 80mg each time, but wonder if it is actually helping at all. Too scared to stop it !.. Have been trying Paul McKenna's hypnotherapy tapes for stress and relaxation hoping to self-help the anxiety side of my problem. The answers I have read here have helped me alot this morning, certainly the doctor who has replied here has said more than any UK doctor has taken to the time to say to me. I am told that I am anxious, I know that myself, but constant trigeminy/bigeminy is almost impossible to cope with especially when lifting and handling a tall 21 yr old !!  I am now going to read a little more, but so glad to find this !  Kind regards. Julie.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Often hyphenated (which may be why you couldn't find it) this is when a patient \"brady's out.\" Instead of a break in the rhythm that stays broken, it's a gradual slowing down to nothing, a terminal rhythm that just gets slower til it stops and can't be restarted. Sometimes due to a bleed-out but usually part of the sick sinus process, or some other failure of the sinus node, generally without an escape beat generated and frequently due to a proximal right coronary thrombus. Very few are successfully resuscitated. Often heralded by a progressive bradycardia that simply terminates by getting so slow that next beat just never comes.   I hope this is helpful. It's probably not exactly the way it would be written in the textbook, but there it is. Good luck to you!\n\n",

I had the ECG and 3d Echo during my undiagnosed anxiety days. Last week I thought I was having a heart attack so I was rushed in the ER. The attending doctor took my ECG and told that it was normal there was no AV block of some sort. It was probably my anxiety.   So my question can a 2nd degree AV Block disappear?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  Second degree AV block can go away. It can also be misread and go away. Assuming it was read correctly and was Mobitz Type I and not type II, it can go away. Since it did go away, it was either misinterpreted (unlikely but possible) or, well, it's gone. Type I (Wenckebach) is benign anyway, indicates nothing of any significance and requires no treatment. Type II (Hay) wouldn't likely go away on its own. Based on these things I'd say you're in good shape. It's one of those things that can show up one time and then never be caught again.  I hope you can get some help with the anxiety problem, which is a very real problem. If you can learn to differentiate between the sudden-onset symptoms that make you  feel  you're having a heart attack and the real symptoms it would be a great help, because with anxiety/panic attacks the symptoms generally start so quickly we don't have time to think it all through and assume the worst, which starts us into that dread spiral. This is fixable with insight and sometimes medication. It also can stir up benign cardiac symptoms and findings that only make us more anxious.  Then something utterly unrelated to anything happens (like that finding of AV block) and, well, it really sets us up for more dread. So I hope you're looking for help with the anxiety issues.   I hope this has been helpful. Please follow up here with us as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "A 24-hour Holter monitor recording generally will give a pretty typical picture of what someone's heart does on a routine basis. If there are unusual things (like sudden rapid beating) that only happen once in a while, a 30-say event monitor is better. In your case apparently you occasionally have brief periods of type II AV Block, which is unusual in its coming and going like that. With Type II there will normally be junctional (or even ventricular) escape beats, which means a blocking of the signal has occurred for long enough that the AV node decides to just fire off something to maintain the a constant rhythm.   While your cardiologist doesn't seem concerned, and since this only seems to be very occasional, I wouldn't be overly concerned. However, I, personally, would want to know what might be the cause of type II AV block and if it is likely to progress to the point where it may cause symptoms. Obviously your cardiologist doesn' think so, but since there's a big difference between type I and type II and the latter can become troublesome with time, I don't think you should be left to wait until you develop symptoms (lightheadedness, a fainting spell, etc.), mainly because if this happens it could be when you're doing something where you can't just sit yourself down til it passes. I'm confident your cardiologist knows what he's doing, but at this point you  don't know what he's doing (and I'm not quite sure either), so I think it would be not only all right, but probably wise, to press him for some details about this, without undue concern, at least right now.   Good luck to you, and please do follow up with us and keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Try Ablation for Poss. Arrh. That Occurs Only While Asleep?",
    "content": "Thanks very much for the chance to ask my questions.  First, the history.  In February of 2008 at the ripe old of age of 37, I experienced a kind of fainting spell in which I did not faint but went to the ER with very low blood pressure, shaking, and then diarrhea began.   For three months, I had the diarrhea, but often, these episodes occurred at night, while asleep, waking me to rush to the bathroom, feeling like I was going to faint, racing heart, sometimes palpitations, followed by a BM, then some relief, slowing about an hour later.   My doc referred me to a cardiologist who specializes in the electrical aspect (sorry, don't know the technical terms), who diagnosed me with Neurocardiogenic Syncope after a tilt table test.   However, I didn't take the medicine and began to feel better over the course of the summer (I'm a teacher, so spent much of the time resting).  This recent fall semester, everything started up again with a little switch.  I began waking up with a racing heart, faster than before, but no fainting really, except once in awhile.   The cardio doc put me on a halter monitor for a month in November(or something akin through CardioNet) because now she suspects an arrhythmia.  I have also been seeing a GI since my BMs oscillated between normal and some diarrhea now and then.  He concluded, today actually, that he thinks the GI symptoms are a reaction to something else and recommended an allergist, who also will test for more in-depth hormonal issues.  Anyway, my cardiologist met with me yesterday and noted that all of my racing heart episodes occur after I've fallen asleep (according to me and the monitor results).  She said that arrhythmias that only happen lying down are very rare and didn't seem to be leaning towards that.  However, she now wants to do an EP to determine if I have an arrhythmia and then ablation if so.  My questions are:  1.  Does anyone hear have experience or knowledge of arrhythmias that happen only when you are lying down and asleep? If so, do you know why they manifest only then?  Why not while I'm conscious?   2.  Do arrhythmias make one feel strange in the chest?  During the day, I often feel alternately a strange \"weakness\" or an odd pressure or something that causes me to need to stretch my arms and chest for relief.  My heart is not racing when this happens.  3.  I had some coffee today but not that much, though I haven't had it for a week since I cut it out while dealing with a cold.  When I laid down just now to go to sleep, I began to have the strange feeling in my chest, began to feel jittery/shaky, then suddenly had to have a BM.  Does an arrhythmia have such an effect on the body?  And can it be brought on just by lying down?   4. Is an EP and possible ablation risky?  Problematic afterward?  Etc.  5.  Finally, can arrhythmias simply appear this late in life?  I've been fine until this last year.   I'm very frustrated because this all has been going on for nearly a year and still no real diagnosis.  Could something else be happening?  They did a sonogram of my heart with normal results.  My thyroid is fine.  All sorts of GI tests came back fine.  No parasites.  The one thing that seemed to make me feel a little better has been about six days of taking GSE (Grapefruit Seed Extract) at 125 mgs/day.  This seems to have at least put my intestines in order and made me feel better during the day, yay!   Thank you in advance for any advice, speculative, certain or otherwise!  Best,  Amy\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Amy,  First, yes, arrhythmias can start at any time in life, and your age group is one of the more popular ones, statistically. You may have neurocardiogenic syncope (or plain vasovagal faint) syndrome, but I believe there is something else going on as well. I strongly suspect the GI symptoms  are related also, since the vagus nerve, which controls peristatic action in the stomach and intestines, also controls the slowing of the heart. If the vagus nerve isn't behaving appropriately the sympathetic side of the control system can allow the heart to speed up. Further, there are known arrhythmic syndromes which are triggered by position. While your particular problem, if it truly is happening (and the event monitor seems  to bear this out), is rather unusual, it's not unheard of at all.   There are some other distinctive things about this that you've mentioned, such as the \"odd\" feeling in your chest even when not having an actual arrhythmic episode. This could be due to anything from anxiety to a nerve acting improperly to a space in the  septum between the atria (the upper chamers of the heart). This is usually called an atrial septal aneurysm, even though it's not an aneurysm as usually understood and is not dangerous. These often are the cause of positional arrhythmias.   As for the electrophysiology (EP) study, I think this makes by far the most sense, since the sort of problem you're having, at best, is disruptive to your life and activities. At worst it could result in you passing out and being injured. Generally that's the biggest concern with these things. Perhaps you can learn the name of the specific type of arrhythmia that was detected by the event monitor and let me know? It would be helpful in sorting  this out. Even if you're unable to do that, I'd strongly recommend going through with the  EP study. Now to answer your concerns about that:  1) I have both experience and knowlege of EP studies, cardioversion and radio frequency ablations. I'm a huge fan, in fact. :)  2) Arrhythmias usually do make people feel \"strange\" in the chest. Sometimes,  if there is an  anatomical anomaly associated with them, this can happen  even when there's no actual arrhythmia going on, as you've described.  3) We've covered this one in the body of my response, but to save words, yes to everything you asked under this one.   4) While all invasive procedures carry some risk, the relative risk posed by EP study with or without ablation is statistically very low and the success rate very high. It would be comparable to something like having a tooth extracted, risk-wise, but a lot less uncomfortable.  5) This one got answered up top. Yes,  they can.   I hope this helps ease your concerns about the procedure, which, again ,I'd strongly advise you to go through with. This may be a lot less complex than it sounds, and you may just be extremely somatically sensitive; on the other hand, the strange sensations you experience and the unusual presentation of the arrhythmias certainly make this something I personally would want corrected if at all possible. If it were to turn out to carry some additional risk discovered only during the procedure, this would either have been discussed in advance or the procedure would be stopped and you'd be informed afterward what was found and what would be needed. In some very rare instances there's some anatomical anomaly that just won't allow the thing to be corrected via ablation, and then usually it is just handled medically. In the long run, the EP study is definitely worthwhile, though, because these cases are so rare, and so often the thing can be corrected in one visit, no medication is needed afterward, and the whole thing can be forgotten.  This is by far the most common outcome of these studies.   Again, I hope  this is helpful. If you have any further questions please don't hesitate to bring them to us here. Best of luck to you, and keep us updated, please.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi John,  Wow, thanks so much for your thorough and enlightening response!  I\u2019m heartened by your informative explanation and advice \u2013 and am feeling much better about the prospects of the EP study.  Even if it proves no arrhythmia, at least it won\u2019t be harmful, but rather, will provide some insight, fingers crossed.  I can\u2019t recall what kind of arrhythmia my electrophysiologist speculated it may be; I only remember her saying something about determining if it\u2019s a normal sinus rhythm or a __________.   In fact, she seemed to question the notion that it only occurs at night as she reviewed the strips from my thirty-day monitor.  She said, \u201cAn arrhythmia that occurs only after you\u2019ve gone to sleep is rare.\u201d    Maybe a bit more history and a few more of the persistent symptoms will enlighten?  I\u2019ll throw it out there; if it sounds like more of the same, no problem.  I\u2019m very grateful for the information you\u2019ve already provided.  The \u201cepisodes\u201d began last February 2008 after an especially strenuous semester of teaching, compounded by a move at the end of the year and holiday pressures to boot.  By the time school began in late January, I was fairly exhausted and had undergone a lot of stress.  In retrospect, it appears fitting that the first manifestation of whatever this is happened in February.  The first episode took place after I came home from teaching a long weekend class, ate lunch, and then proceeded to have diarrhea and collapse.  I didn\u2019t pass out, but I ended up shaking a lot, feeling like I would faint, and just generally, feeling terrible.    The episodes that followed were much the same, except they primarily took place at night.  I would go to sleep, awaken with a weird feeling, suddenly my heart would race and I would feel like passing out.  During these first few months, I ended up crawling around on the floor to fight the fainting and the low blood pressure, which would end after anywhere from fifteen minutes to an hour with a bout of diarrhea and some relief/extreme exhaustion after that.  I also experienced about three months of diarrhea, which, as earlier noted, the GI has now said was a symptom of something unrelated to GI.  The times I went to the ER during this period were mostly because I couldn\u2019t get my blood pressure up.  After a few bags of saline and normal CBC results, I would be sent home to recuperate for the entire day.    That period of culminated in a week-long hospital stay of many tests in April:  a head and neck MRI, sonograms of assorted varieties (chest, abdomen, etc), endoscopy/colonoscopy, and general rest.  I left with no diagnosis, though I had stayed in the cardiac wing, with nothing terribly noteworthy except ongoing bradycardia.    During the summer, I rested as I was off from school.  I felt generally okay during the summer, with very few episodes.  My cardiologist diagnosed Neurocardiogenic Syncope during this period of feeling better.    Once the fall semester began again, I lasted until the second month of school until the episodes began again.  This time, they did not revolve around me shaking and nearly passing out, but rather, now I fall asleep, awaken suddenly and my heart either begins to race or I feel palpitations.  Sometimes, my stomach feels like it\u2019s pulsing.    As you noted, position actually seems to have an effect sometimes.  I can feel weird pressure/muted pain on my left side now and then, just on the side and on my back behind my breast.  If I lie on that side during sleep, I can feel my heart begin to speed up and am awakened.  Shifting off the side alleviates.  My doc said it\u2019s just because we can feel the heart beat more on our left side, but I think there\u2019s something to the actual positioning that brings on whatever is happening.  Otherwise, the previously accompanying shaking has mostly subsided, though I did have one recent episode when I was sick with bronchitis at the end of December that involved very low blood pressure and shaking upon waking.  Mostly though, I check my blood pressure when I get up to pace, and it\u2019s fine.  It is my heart that is sometimes racing, above 100 bpm, around 120 or so.  Normally, I\u2019m around 70 bpm.  Everything calms after I pace and often have a b.m., which has improved, as earlier noted too.  Writing this, it seems like a lot of the earlier symptoms were related to exhaustion, though the sleep-sudden-awakening episodes continue.  Stress does appear to exacerbate the episodes; I had a stressful day recently and couldn\u2019t even lie down without starting to shake a little.  When I finally did get to sleep, I awoke several times with smaller versions of a lurching/palpitating heart.  While uncomfortable, I was finally able to get to sleep by 4 a.m.    I assume stress can bring the arrhythmia out, assuming that is what I have.  I guess we\u2019ll find out once the EP study is done.  I\u2019m also planning on seeing an endocrinologist shortly as the GI recommended me too.  He wasn\u2019t sure if I had a food allergy or something hormonal.  My gyn also recommended an endocrinologist; he wonders if the episodes increase due to hormonal changes.  I\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019m covering all of my bases, so will follow through that way too.  I guess I should mention, especially as I\u2019m feeling it right now, that sometimes sitting a certain way (right now, leaning back on the sofa against some pillows in a slouch position with a computer on my lap) that I do feel some \u2018fluttering\u2019, mostly in the back behind my heart.  Add this to the already-mentioned weird pressure you addressed, and I guess that just proves I\u2019m trying to listen to my body and keep track of all of the symptoms, at risk of inundating you and my docs, with apologies!    Okay, this tome may not have illuminated what kind of arrhythmia, but maybe it will help someone with a similar array of symptoms.  The good news is that while everything was scary earlier on, I realized through it all that I would ultimately be okay and that it will take endurance and patience to press on and find out what needs to be done.  I feel better overall, after this many months, and am optimistic about the final determinations.  Finally, thank you once again for your response.  It is one of the most thorough and professional responses I\u2019ve received in person and online.  Kudos to you for your kindness and the sharing of your expertise!  Much appreciated~  I will be in touch about changes and further updates!  Warm regards,  Amy\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Amy, and you are very welcome.  All this is very interesting, and while I supposed we can always overthink things if we really get into them, it also doesn't hurt for the patient to be aware and paying attention and also to be as well informed as possible. Some doctors find that annoying, but it definitely is the wave of the future, and it's a good and positive thing for the most part.   Much of what you add here fits in with the earlier picture, especially the times when stress (emotional and/or physical) has been involved. Stress will definitely aggravate arrhythmias, whether they are the completely \"normal\" ones like an increase in premature heartbeats (PVCs, PACs, etc.) or if there is an underlying paroxysmal arrhythmia that is to some degree problematic. Stress will exacerbate just about anything.   I have a funny feeling what your doctor said (to fill in that blank) was \"junctional\" rhythm. I could be wrong, but because of the context and wording I kind of think that may have been the word. Junctional rhythms, while not dangerous, can be really annoying, mainly when accellerated or rapid. (You can also have junctional rhythms at a normal rate, and these we don't notice as a rule -- they just kind of fit in). When junctional rhythms perisist and are accellerated (around 100-120 BPM) or rapid (around 120-140 BPM) they are more noticeable for sure. This would fit your description as well, and these could show up on a Holter tracing during 24 hours without all of them (or any, even) having been noticed. It all depends on the rate.   Nocturnal arrhythmias are rather unusual, except -- and this is a big exception -- when they are triggered by position. Now many doctors will automatically respond to the suggestion that this is happening (especially to people who say it happens when they lay on their left side) with \"You can feel your heartbeat more acutely in that position.\" And that's true! But -- it also puts the the apex of the heart of many a person up against the chest wall, and -- surprise -- the heart does not like to be \"touched.\" So lots of times not only do we feel our hearts beating in this position, and not only are premature heartbeats far more common as we start to doze off or just get sleepy (or after a meal, etc.), but that position, in many people, is also enough to make the heart kick back against the \"touch\" of the chest wall. It's just an anatomical \"thing.\" It happens. Not everyone recognizes this, but enough do that it's a safe statement to make. One's doctor can always say \"Does not!\" If that happens, well, there's no real point and going back and forth over it. It's normal for those who have it happen, but not worth arguing over.   You also have mentioned in this update that sometimes your rate gets up to 100 - 120 (and while this is a range that can be felt by many and be annoying as well, it's usually not enough to get a doctor excited), it drops back to normal after \"pacing\" and/or a BM takes place. This latter is important, because even when one has diarrhea and the movement seems effortless, there is some degree of straining involved, if only involuntary, and this sort of maneuver is often also called a Valsalva maneuver. Any sort of straining -- at stool, by stretching certain ways, anything that causes tensing, momentary taking in and holding of the breath, then release, is a Valsalva maneuver, meaning it stimulates the sinus of Valsalva, which is located in the aorta (there are other, related, cardiac sinuses in other places), and this causes vagal stimulation which slows the heart rate. So that fits perfectly.  The business about lying back against some pillows and feeling a fluttering in the back of your heart (a subjective analysis, as it's really difficult for us to locate these sensations, so we say what it feels like, even though it may be coming from somewhere else), fits with the earlier observation that there could be an anatomical abnormality (such as an atrial septal aneurysm) and sometimes these are also very much affected by position. Again, interesting.  While this may not have clarified what sort of arrhythmia you've been having (and it could be more than one kind, as we all have random little bursts of this or that in odd moments from time to time -- but you have something consistent going on), it also may have. I keep visualizing \"junctional\" in that blank space. It would certainly make a good fit. So would \"accellerated idioventricular\" (AIVR) except that's so long and  awkward and is actually fairly unusual outside the hospital setting -- though it can happen and is bothersome to those who have it.   So we may not know more than before, but I feel as though I have a better feel for this and apparently you do as well, especially the emotional effect of it, and that's a very good thing. Your realization that this is likely very innocent-but-annoying is a big help to you in your day-to-day functioning, and the attitude that it will either be a nothing or will be fixed some way or another is very important, because it's true.  Again, you are very welcome, and I very much appreciate the kind words. I do what I can. I'll be looking forward to interesting updates. :)  My best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your note, Sheri!  I had postponed the EP study because I thought all might be due to a recently diagnosed, though longterm, case of H Pylori infection.  Though I'm still experiencing some palpitations, the episodes have abated.  Of course, it's only been two weeks since I began my alternative treatments (details on my blog noted below), and I fully expected, until yesterday, that everything would return to normal.    Anyway, here's a synopsis & update since my last post, with apologies, because I'm addressing a doctor here, and John Kenyon!, and would love to send the ECG to someone via email to take a look:  I have been experiencing strange episodes for nearly a year now that have had all sorts of accompanying symptoms (described in detail below); the end result recently was that I had gone undiagnosed with H Pylori for the year.  Since that diagnosis, I have been addressing the bacterial infection with a number of \"alternative\" medicines (under my primary physician's supervision - such things as Manuka Honey, Monolaurin, etc) and have become increasingly better by the day.  I no longer awaken in the middle of the night with the \"episodes\", though I still have some palpitations now and then.  At worst, I get up in the middle of the night feeling a bit uncomfortable, but then after a bowel movement five minutes later, am able to return to bed.   Overall, I'm feeling much like my former, \"normal\" self.  Which brings me to you.  As a precaution, I saw a new GI, who wanted to do an endoscopy (finished today -- result:  mild gastritis & reflux).  She did a standard ECG beforehand the other day, which registered as \"abnormal.\"  I sent this to my cardiologist, who is also an electrophysiologist, who had me come in for another ECG, which turned out to be normal.  In fact, all of my ECGs with her (Dr. Ibrahim) have been normal.  During the worst of my symptoms early last summer, she had diagnosed me with Neurocardiogenic Syncope, though I stopped the medicine for that after a week, and then a few months later the episodes changed to racing heart.  Anyway, Dr. Ibrahim still determined that I may have Brugada Syndrome based on the ECG (attached) that came from my GI's office.  I asked her if she felt strongly about it; she faxed it to another colleague, who replied immediately that he was \"underwhelmed\" and didn't think it necessarily indicated Brugada syndrome.  So my question to is, Does my one ECG, out of many over the last year, indicative or classic Brugada (I'm happy to send it along via email to anyone with some knowledge about ECG readings)?  I'm concerned because while I don't mind having the ECHO and the stress test, I am also scheduled for an EP study, which seems invasive and unnecessary if a) I'm getting better and b) my symptoms were caused by H Pylori, which is currently being eradicated.   Are there any other methods for discovering if I have this syndrome?  HISTORY (written on my blog, February 20th) --  * I originally had a racing heart, three months of diarrhea, and would nearly pass out, especially in the middle of the night.  I also could not lie down for hours after each episode.  Yes, I would leap up from sleep in the middle of the night to crawl around, trying not to faint, and then have many nasty visits to the toilet.  Follow that with the topper of being utterly spent and not being able to lie down due to weird chest/stomach pressure, and you\u2019ve got a nice recipe for exhaustion, missed work, and a social life put on major hold.  * Next, I moved on to leaping up from sleep to pace for hours while my heart raced and I shook.  A few times, my heart raced to the point I thought I was having a heart attack (I once wished I could just go unconscious to avoid the experience,which was painful and frightening), and then I would projectile vomit.  Yum.  I ended up in many ERs, to no avail.  * I have since graduated to heart palpitations and many bouts of bowel movements that are solid but frequent.   And am gaining weight back.  Okay, so day and night symptoms have included:  weight loss, shaking, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea alternating with constipation, loss of appetite, racing heart, syncope, shortness of breath, palpitations, weakness/fatigue, night sweats/hot flashes, and anxiety.  http://amyking.wordpress.com/2009/02/20 ... -h-pylori/  Any advice on this scary possibility (Brugada) is most warmly welcome.  Thanks,  Amy\n\n",

    "content": "John, This is to ask you about the EP study or ablation for someone that has a platelet disorder.  I have VonWillobrand and I was told by an EP I would need to be on a blood thinner 6 weeks before and 6 weeks after.  Being that I have this bleeding disorder I am quite concerned about it.  I like Amy have nocturnal A Fib, A Runs, A couplets.  I have lived with this since 2004 and to add, yes, stress, caffeine, chocolate, alcohol, bring it on.  Also, an important thing to suggest to AMY is \"has she had a thyroid panel done for hyper thyroidism and or Graves disease?  I was misdiagnosed for 3 years and almost went into thyroid storm.  I believe this is what started my heart arrhythmia's.  The EP doctors I went to said that it was to early to think of ablation.  They are all reputable EP doctors.  I do not take meds as I am very sensitive.  There are many opinions about Lone Paroxysmal A Fib and chronic needing to be on blood thinners due to stroke risk.  I have been told repeatedly by Cardios that one is in danger if they are in A Fib 24 hours straight, and then they are put on blood thinners.  There is controversy about that at the moment.  I am on an event monitor at the moment and that is quite enlightening as it picks up exactly what  arrhythmia's one has.  Anyway, thank you for your kindness in ready this...  Sherie  John Kenyon, CNA wrote:Hi Amy,  First, yes, arrhythmias can start at any time in life, and your age group is one of the more popular ones, statistically. You may have neurocardiogenic syncope (or plain vasovagal faint) syndrome, but I believe there is something else going on as well. I strongly suspect the GI symptoms  are related also, since the vagus nerve, which controls peristatic action in the stomach and intestines, also controls the slowing of the heart. If the vagus nerve isn't behaving appropriately the sympathetic side of the control system can allow the heart to speed up. Further, there are known arrhythmic syndromes which are triggered by position. While your particular problem, if it truly is happening (and the event monitor seems  to bear this out), is rather unusual, it's not unheard of at all.   There are some other distinctive things about this that you've mentioned, such as the \"odd\" feeling in your chest even when not having an actual arrhythmic episode. This could be due to anything from anxiety to a nerve acting improperly to a space in the  septum between the atria (the upper chamers of the heart). This is usually called an atrial septal aneurysm, even though it's not an aneurysm as usually understood and is not dangerous. These often are the cause of positional arrhythmias.   As for the electrophysiology (EP) study, I think this makes by far the most sense, since the sort of problem you're having, at best, is disruptive to your life and activities. At worst it could result in you passing out and being injured. Generally that's the biggest concern with these things.

    "content": "Amy, has anyone suggested a 30 day event monitor?  I am wearing one now, and it registers Atrial runs, Atrial fib, that was never picked up on a 24 hour halter.  My heart is sound, clear arteries, (had a CT angio) no valve problems, and I had the same (more or less) symptoms you did with the diarrhea as well.  It is no problem to wear, does not show, and has really enlightened my current Cardio and I know what my options are more or less at this time.  It would settle your heart rhythm problem if you wore one for even a few weeks.  If you have any heart arrhythmia's it would show, and then you would settle that issue.  Everything I had done with the heart was normal, until I insisted on an event monitor.  I was suffering terribly, with frequent nocturnal awakening, running to the bathroom as well, and knew there was something more going on.  I changed cardios and the new one was quite amenable to my wearing the event monitor.  I thought I was going crazy with the symptoms and being told there was nothing wrong.  The event monitor showed the arrhythmia's and identified what they were.  I almost have them just at rest while asleep, but now I know what I am dealing with.  I have been to two EPs and am quite shy of an EP study right now, as I would have to go on anticoagulants for 6 weeks before and six weeks after the procedure.  I have a platelet disorder so it is even more of a decision to make.  Again, just a reminder \"have you had a simple thyroid panel?\"  That would be to see if it equates to some of the problems you are having.  It could cause many of them.  Many times we have multiple symptoms and we neglect to check out  the simple things.  Anyway, keep me informed.  Warmest regards Sherie\n\n",

    "content": "For Sherie --  FIrst, I'm puzzled as to the reasoning of the EP specialist who a) feels (along with others you've seen) it's too soon to consider ablation; and b) feels prior and post EP study you'd need to be on a blood thinner (or more likely an anticoagulant). While sustained, intractable A-fib can certainly justify treatment with warfarin to prevent clots from forming, there are some considerations here that just don't seem to add up, at least in my experience. First, most EP studies are done with an eye always toward possible ablation, and are carried out with this possibility (and even hope) in mind. Second, if you're not experiencing sustained or frequent episodes of A-fib of 72 hours or more, most doctors I know would not ordinarily prescribe an anticoagulant therapy, although you might be placed on aspirin therapy. However, all this is made somewhat moot because of Von Willobrand's, which makes unwanted clotting rather unlikely. We don't generally look forward to doing any sort of cath on someone on anticoagulants anyway, and certainly don't try and get people on them prior and post cath unless they've already been diagnosed as being in chronic A-fib. Since your experience with this problem seems to be in intermittent and often triggered one, it hardly seems appropriate to have you on anticoagulants pre-and-post procedure unless the doctor is fairly certain A-fib will be triggered in the course of the procedure, and if this is so (and VWD already duly noted), anyone I know would want to ablate an induceable A-fib site.   So I'm perplexed by this.   Since you've been diagnosed with Graves' disease, magagement of this should keep your A-fib interludes at the intermittent to only occasional level anyway, and while it may account for the arrhythmia (and often does, in fact), if this is the case, why even consider an EP study? Is it because the A-fib continues despite management of hyperthyroidism? If so, why do the study, again, without the contingency of an ablation? And all through this, with VWD, why the fairly long-term anticoagulant therapy? Am I missing something?   Since more than one EP doctor has told you the same thing, I'm not so much arguing the issue as looking to learn what on earth could be the reasoning behind all this. I'm sure they have their reasons, but I just don't see it. If any or all of them believe there may be a residual irritable site causing the episodes of A-fib (and other, random, less noxious atrial blips), then why do an EP study without hoping to ablate the spot? And the anticoagulant business just stumps me completely.   Sorry to go in circles like that, but it seems a fairly straightforward situation, yet for some reason you've been told a lot of things that just don't seem logical to me. Then again, I am no doctor. I've just been party to so many of these procedures I feel fairly comfortable predicting how they'd be handled.   I'd like to say I hope this is helpful, but it probably hasn't been. If it at least raises some useful questions that might be some small value to you.   Best of luck to you. Please keep in touch with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "First, let me just say how kind and enouraging it is to be in touch with John Kenyon.  His generosity is consistent on this site -- he deserves some flowers and applause, if I may be sentimental.  Not too many sites on heart issues where someone with experience, real experience, shares fully his speculations and questions regarding a situation.  Kudos to John Kenyon.  Next, Sherri, thanks very much for your advice.  My doc checked for Graves last year, so I'm good on that end.   Oddly, it really does seem as though much of the heart issues was a response to the H Pylori infection.  This kind of heart response is not typical of an infection, but I guess when you're dealing with an ongoing infection in the central nervous system and, more than likely, nutritional deficiencies, all sorts of things can go awry.  I mean, I've been having palpitations beyond the episodes (which don't happen anymore), and the solution to stop the palpitations has been to take a good calcium/magnesium supplement and to alternate that with a good magnesium/potassium supplement.  It's working.  I do eat lots of veggies, chicken, fish, etc., but these still don't seem to supply enough of those ingredients, though my blood work has been sufficient in those areas.  Anyway, that's where we're at.  And as I noted to John Kenyon via email, I contacted Dr. Brugada through the Brugada syndrome website.  He read my ECG and replied that he saw no evidence of Brugada syndrome.  So I'm relieved.  I am still going for a second opinion to be sure, but overall, I'm less anxious and more relaxed, which certainly does have a considerable effect on the body and one's health.  Throughout all of this, I've had to learn to address anxiety in a way I never considered before because I was not an anxious person in the past.  Fine.  But now that medical issues have been raised, voila!  Yoga, a cognitive behavioral specialist, and lots of other magic later, I'm much more equipped for coping with bad news, though I prefer not to get any for awhile!    Anyway, good luck Sherri.  I hope John's advice will give you some better ground to proceed on.    Best, Amy\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I'm a 25 year-old female with normal blood pressure and good cholesterol.  I've had an echo, which was normal, and a 24-hour holter monitor that showed 65 PVCs and 1 PAC.

Sometimes my PVCs seem to come one right after another, and this scares me because I've read about ventricular tachycardia.  Can PVCs ever turn into something worse?  My cardiologist says that this is unlikely, especially given all of my normal tests.  I get very worried, though.  I worry about sudden cardiac death from these things.  Is this even possible?  I don't have any other symptoms besides the anxiety these skips cause.  What are the chances of getting v-tach, and does this or ventricular fibrilation occur in someone with an otherwise normal healthy heart?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Do PVCs lead to v-tach?",
    "content": "Hi there -  Your question is a very common one, and understandably a concern. I hopefully can put your mind at ease about this, though. PVCs, the most common heartbeat irregularity, occurs in almost everyone at some time or another. Some people have them very frequently, others only occasionally, others sporadically. Your Holter monitor findings are very ordinary, and 65 PVCs in a 24 hour period amount to an average of less than three per hour, which is actually infrequent, although in most cases they occur in random patterns, so some could be closer together than others. What sometimes feels like multiple PVCs (which sensation you describe in your post) can be one of several innocent things: most commonly it is one PVC which, for some unknown reason, can sometimes be percieved as a \"fluttering\" sensation. There's little correlation between the perceived force, number, etc., of them, and the actual characteristics of a given PVC. Group beating (ventricular bigemeny, trigenemy, etc.) means every second, third, fourth, etc., beat is a PVC in a given period of time. Some people have bigemeny as their normal rhythm. Some people aren't even aware it's happening. Also, you could actually have, on occasion,  more than one consecutive PVC, and as I'm sure you've found out, three or more in a row are considered, for technical purposes, a \"run\" of V-tach.  In reality this is an arbitrary definition, and a very conservative one.   PVCs, without any other electrical or structural abnormality, are of virtually no diagnostic nor prognostic value at all. They occur in everyone in various sorts of patterns, and again, absent any structural or neurocardiological disease, they have no real meaning. They can, however, be very alarming when they occur, and can provoke a good deal of anxiety which, unforntunately, causes the release of adrenaline, which in  turn makes the heart muscle more irritable, and often thus sets off yet more PVCs, sometimes making the sufferer a nervous wreck. This is truly unfortunate, because without significant left ventricular dysfunction PVCs have no meaning at all (and even with LV dysfunction they are only an indicator, not a cause, of potential trouble).   In  short, your doctor is appropriately circumspect in his answer, and PVCs really are almost always best ignored -- if possible. Sometimes it can be difficult to ignore them, which is the big problem. If they are very frequent or bothersome sometimes the doctor will prescribe a beta blocker to reduce the frequency of them, which usually helps cut down on their frequency and makes them more difficult to percieve, so  that is a fallback possibility if they start to really bother you.  Still, they have virtually no clinical significance otherwise, and often this knowlege is sufficient to ease the mind of a given patient enough that they are no longer seen as a problem. Hopefully this will be the case with you.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please do stay in touch with us if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you very much for that response.  It has been about four months, and I still have the PVCs.  I do my best to ignore them, but it concerns me when I feel like they come back to back.  I've been told this is a pattern called bigeminy.  I had an echo a year ago which was normal, and I was told that I do not need another one, is this true?  Also, I wore a second holter monitor about two months ago because I was concerned that the PVCs were increasing.  My first holter had 65 PVCs recorded, and my second one had 135 PVCs recorded.  The doctor said that this doesn't matter how many I have in a day.  I've been getting over anxiety, and on my first holter my average heart rate was 92 bpm, and on my second holter my average heart rate was 78 bpm.  I'd say I've improved there, but what about the PVCs?  Are they really still benign no matter how many or what pattern they're in?  I'm still afraid to exercise because I'm afraid of developing a dangerous abnormal rhythm.  I feel them if I sit down after walking around or if I go from sitting down to moving around all of a sudden.  I still worry that the PVCs will turn into something worse.  Do I have any reason to still be concerned?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi KatrinaS -  It's very difficult for a lot of people to reconcile the benign nature of PVCs with the way they feel (or at least as they are perceived in a lot of people -- not everyone feels them, which I find strange, but only because I feel mine quite clearly). Still, they carry no diagnostic nor prognostic value at all. It was once believed that frequent PVCs were ominous in very specific settings critical clinical settings, but now it has been determined beyond any reasonable doubt that even in those specific settings (people with severe heart disease and compromised function due to damage from prior heart attack or structural disease) half of those who die because of advanced heart disease have had no PVCs during or immediately prior to the terminal event. In other words, PVCs don't cause sudden cardiac death, nor do they predict it. They are rarely treated now, even in those serious clinical settings. They are normal in the general population, and some people have them extremely frequently (sometimes thousands in 24 hours) while others have them only occasionally. The rates of occurrence evidenced by your Holter monitor recordings would rank as occasional to infrequent, but the extremely unpleasant sensation (and some are just far more sensitive to it than others) makes some feel there must be something sinister going on. It's understandable, too. The heart, when it's working in an orderly fashion, is not usually noticed. However, like our breathing, once attention has been attracted to it, it is very difficult to ignore.   The phenomenon of bigemeny (and trigemeny and quadragemeny -- I think they stopped naming after every fourth beat) is based on a physiological rule that's actually rather arcane, but the rule itself proves that even bigemeny is a benign rhythm; However, it can be, for some people, extremely uncomfortable. I've found that sometimes people will notice it and at other times not. Part of the reason for this is the timing of PVCs, and bigemeny, since it is very regular in its irregularity, follows its own rule, that when a PVC fires while the tricuspid valve is shut, it causes a much more noticebale \"kick\" and sometimes a very creepy sensation of backing up into the jugular in the neck, which is exactly what happens. With bigemeny if the first one happens at that point in the cycle, then the rest in that \"row\" will also. It makes no difference and nothing bad will happen, but those feel even more \"wrong\" than PVCs that occur when the tricuspid valve is open and the extra blood that collects in the half second or less of the pause before the next regular beat can be pushed out more easily, so doesn't cause the \"water hammer\" effect.   It's all very technical and involves both electrical and plumbing issues, but the bottom line is that your doctor is absolutely correct: they are benign, and it doesn't matter how many you have (except in a psychological sense). There are some who have bigemeny as their \"normal\" rhythm, and in some it goes away with exercise only to return upon cooling down. The only time PVCs are of any interest at all is when they occur in a setting of severe left ventricular dysfunction or marked structural disease (causing the same dysfunction in a different way). Either of these will have far more troubling and debilitating symptoms that PVCs, either is quite evident of cardiac workup, and even with all that said, the patient may not have any more PVCs than a randomly chosen healthy person and they still aren't usually treated, just noted.  It sounds as though you've done a lot of calming if you've gotten your average resting heart rate down from the 90s to the 70s, which speaks well for your emotional health, which is the primary concern.  You're perfectly safe in resuming a fitness program, though you will likely notice PVCs when you change from an active to a resting status or sometimes vice versa. (For some they always go away with exercise and return after, and for others it works the opposite way). Avoidance of caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, sleep disturbances and stress are a few ways to possibly reduce the frequency of the palpitations, but even then there's no guarantee they won't just kick up now and again, and that's perfectly normal.   You definitely can put your concerns to rest. Following through by slowly learning to not notice or not attach any value to those occasional unpleasant sensations is another matter, and for most of us, only time and experience will really convince us they're harmless, no matter what our doctors tells us. It's hard to ignore someone who keeps tapping you on the shoulder -- or inside the chest.   I hope this helps dispel your concerns as much as is possible. It's a remarkably common concern, but people tend not to mention it to others for some reason. If they did, we'd all probably be better off. Thanks for bringing your concerns here. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you very much for your responses, Dr. Kenyon.  You provided such honest and detailed answers, and I really appreciate that.  One other thing that I forgot to ask is in regards to the testing I've had for my PVCs.  I had an echocardiagram done one year ago.  I had two holter monitors done during 2008 a few months apart, as well as a few EKGs, chest xray, and blood tests.  Like I said, these tests all came back normal, and the holter caught the PVCs.  Have I had all of the necessary tests done?  I've read many people getting stress tests, but my cardiologist and other said they didn't think that was necessary.  I'm almost 26 years old, and I've read other people's postings who are around my age having stress tests.  Is this something I should have?  Also, is there any need to repeat any of my tests?  I'm mostly referring to the echo because I had that a year ago.  I noticed you mentioned in a posting that you get PVCs and feel them, too.  Have you ever had yours recorded?  Do you know how many a day you get?  Just curious since so many people are in the same boat!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again -  You're very welcome. Given your overall history the choice of stress test vs. no stress test is a \"doctor's choice\" situation. It's really not indicated but would do no harm, and might help ease your mind. The doctor has to weigh the value vs. expense, etc., before suggesting pro or con. It seems unlikely it would bring anything new to light, but if you would feel better for having it done and have coverage or the means to pay for one, then my all means press for it. You've had all the requisite tests done to cover the problem that brought you in, and you're basically good to go.   People who've had one echocardiogram (adults that is) and have had it come back negative (which is a positive thing -- confusing, eh?) usually aren't suggested another unless new and different symptoms arise. So the answer, at least for the time being, is that you shouldn't need another.  Due to the nature of my work I've had the opportunity to \"play\" with a lot of testing devices (as well as some reason to at times, as well), including various cardiac recording devices, including the Holter monitor.I don't usually do this, but I'll tell you what my most \"interesting\" result was: one time (perhaps I was drinking more coffee than usual) I showed up more than 5700 PVCs in 24 hours. This actually wasn't so remarkable, but I was surprised nonetheless. And of course we all made jokes about it and that was that. Seriously, the number of them can be almost zero or can be in the tens of thousands and be equally irrelevent; it mostly depends on how bothersome the sensation is to an individual and if there is any significant structural abnormality. In the absence of the latter, it really doesn't matter.   Good luck to you and please stay in touch. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to bring them here.\n\n",

I wore one of those 30-day event monitors about a month and a half ago.  It was becuase I had \"complained\" enough about my PVC's that my doctor wanted me to wear one in case there was something I was feeling that was different than just PVC's.  I wore it continuously for a week, and then a few times the remaining time I had the monitor for because I was able to capture everything that normally concerns me during that first week of wearing it.  My doctor didn't have much to say about it after all the results were in, and he said there was nothing dangerous reported, and it was usual PVC's (some short bigeminy) with normal sinus rhythm.  I was able to get a copy of the summary of the strips, and there are just two things that I don't know what they mean and would like explained to me.  There was one time when the monitor captured PJC's...what is a PJC?  The other thing was (and I'm glad I was able to get this recorded) when I feel my heart sort of flutter for a brief second and feels different than a PVC skip.  The monitor said this was five beats of AIVR.  What is AIVR, and is it something I should be worried about?  I'm not overly concerned since my doctor said no news is good news, and he didn't have any news for me, but I'd just like to know what those things are and if I should actually be concerned or not.  Thanks again in advance for taking the time to read and answer my questions!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello and thank you for the kind words. I'm glad I've been helpful, and I never mind additional questions. That's what we're here for!  Your questions are very interesting (and interested,  too, which is good). While I usually don't mention PJCs (there are just so many types of premature beats) but since you asked, and it is your heart after all, I'll tell you: it stands for premature junctional contraction. What sets these apart from PVCs and PACs is, of course, their locus of origin, and since they originate in the atrioventricular junction (or AV node -- sometimes are called \"nodal\" premature beats),  they don't look very exciting on the EKG and, in fact, they aren't as a rule. They're a little less common than the other kinds, and are associated with less complaints in general, but they can show up and are, like the others, perfectly normal to have.  The runs of AIVR are a really weird, very benign, but extremely odd-feeling phenomenon. It is often seen in the ICU in patients who've had a blockage cleared, but also occcurs sometimes for no particular reason. It's a very odd sensation  because it does feel like a fluttering or forceful beat, but when one checks the pulse it seems pretty regular, but is usually just a little bit faster while this is going on, but not enough to be alarming. For instance, if the resting pulse is 68 and AIVR starts (usually not for a very long period, maybe 10-15 seconds) it will feel like something funny's going on, but if you check your pulse then it's usually only a little faster (maybe 80 or so). Then the sensation goes away as does the AIVR which, by the way, stands for (are you ready?) accelerated idioventricular rhythm. Just one more little trick our hearts can do to keep us guessing, but in and of itself means nothing, even in an otherwise serious clinical setting. It does look rather distinctive on EKG, however, which sometimes disturbs the inexperienced clinician. It's nothing, but it surely does feel strange.   I hope this clarifies these things for you, and don't hesitate to ask anything any time. It's good to hear from you and I'm glad you had such an uneventful, if interesting, event monitor experience. Take care and please keep in touch.\n\n",

On receiving this devastating news i was very sad and under a lot of stress. After two days of receiving the news i felt some uneasiness in my chest along with shortness of breath.On consulting the doctor he advised me to have a ECG.  On having the ECG the doctor got very tensed and said that I had a very CHAOTIC heart rhythm( my vent rate 107bpm) and quickly advised me to get admitted in an ICCU in a hospital. Later I found that my mother along with all her family had this arrhythmia problem  All the members are living to their old age and never had any prominent symptoms nor were there any instances of SCDs till my brother. In their ECG they had a missing P-wave.  The doctors said that my ECG was different from them.  As far as I remember i knew that I had an abnormal heart rhythm but never took it seriously as i had never had any symptoms such as palpitations or dizziness etc. I was perfectly fine and did some strenuous cardiovascular exercise daily, same as my brother.  In the hospital Angiography and Cartography was done on me. No physical defect, scars or any muscle problem was found, my hear was perfectly fine. The doctor said that extra pulses were being generated from nodes spread over a large area of my heart. Ablation was also done on a few nodes but had no effect and the doc said that he wasn't sure whether more ablation would harm or do good to the heart. He said he didn't know why these nodes had created. The report says: 1) Multifocal VPC's/Bidirectional VT                           2)Ventricular bigemini suppressed with atrial overdrive pacing                           3)focal ablation done in RV, unsuccessful. The doctor said that medical science still doesn't understand this properly and such cases are very rare. Considering the fact that my brother had expired in such a way he considered not taking chances and implanted within me a dual chamber ICD.  After all this and being under medications ( amiodarone and metoprolol succinate), i now sometimes feel palpitations with increasing pulse rate along with uneasiness in chest but no therapies have yet been done by the ICD. My questions : 1)Is this problem completely unheard of or there are a few cases?                        2)Is the ICD really needed?                        3)What is the possibility my brother expired due to this problem?                            His postmortem report shows nothing.                        4)Possibility of something like this happening to me(19 yrs) and                            my mother (49 yrs) who like me never had any symptoms.                            Her ECG is also quite scary but no EP studies have been done on                               her as yet.                        5)If my brother expired due to this what could have been the                            triggering factors.He only did some occasional drinking and                             smoking from past one year but I do none of these. I would be greatly obliged if you could answer my questions because I'm in a very miserable and confused state after this great tragedy. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Viper, I am sorry to hear about your brother. The same thing happened to my best friend when he was 24. To answer your first question, no it is more common than you would think. VT may occasionally come and go in young people without any evidence of heart disease. The person may have no symptoms, except for maybe a funny fluttering feeling in the chest. In your case you are not asymptomatic and have a family history of cardiac arrhythmia's, if left untreated could lead to a very serious arrhythmia one called TORSADE DE POINTES a type of VT that comes from around a central point with bidirectional forms of the tachycardia, the twisting around the central point gives it the funny name, french for curling or twisting. Without knowing all of your history that's why the ICD was implanted so yes you really need it. The possibility that your brother passed away from a life threatening arrhythmia is pretty high especially if his post mortem exam was normal I am sorry to say. The possibility of this happening in your case now is greatly reduced since you have had a full cardiac workup and the ICD. There is no reason at all why you can't live a long normal life as long as you stick to what your cardiologist says and cutting normal risk factors ie. smoking, weight etc. As for your mother please have her get a full cardiac workup and EP study. Again I am sorry for your loss.  Good luck to you and your mother,  Paul\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you very much doctor for giving such a prompt reply. I did not used to have any symptoms of arrhythmia before but as far as I remember my pulse was very irregular from childhood itself.I know this because I had an automated blood pressure monitor which also beeped whenever there was a pulse. After what happened with my brother, it was the first time I had the feeling of chest discomfort and shortness of breath i.e. the first time I showed any symptoms. Also after all these EP studies and implantation of ICD I now have palpitations with increasing pulse rate 'along' with the earlier chest discomfort and shortness of breath. Not only that, after having these palpitations some times during the night, I feel slight pain in my chest(to be precise in the center of the chest) the next whole day along with some twitching sensations in the heart. So even though I'm on medication I still have all these symptoms.         Actually I'm feeling as if all these EP studies, medications and surgery have worsened my symptoms, although my ECG is now quite stable and better than it was before, due to the medicines. Is it possible to have all these symptoms even when you are on medication and have an ICD implanted? Could all this treatment have worsened my symptoms? What is the percentage of people among the many having arrhythmia like me, have a sudden cardiac death?  Also how much is the probability that this problem may appear worsened in my future generation or it may even occur in them.I'm asking this because my ECG is much worse compared to the ECG's of my mothers side relatives( mine is so bad that the peaks in one section are crossing the graph of another section below it!).  I don't know how to thank you enough doctor, for helping me in such a difficult time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, That was very smart of you to notice the alarm on the b.p. monitor was due to your irregular heart rhythm. I couldn't even imagine the stress you are under with your brother and then dealing with your own condition. That would be tough for a person without cardiac problems let alone someone with. It would be normal for you to have an increase in all your stress hormones, one called catecholamine in particular. Increased levels of catecholamines increase heart rate, blood pressure and increase likelihood of cardiac arrhythmia. I don't see in your history if you are on any anti-anxiety medication, if not you might want to discuss taking them with your doctor. Stress, worry, lack of sleep increase catecholamine levels a good anti-anxiety med will decrease catecholamine levels and allow you sleep and may even reduce some of your uncomfortable side effects by lowering the stress hormones. It is possible to have all of these symptoms with the ICD and meds. Remember the important thing is you are asymptomatic and your ECG is normal. The ICD is ready in case you were to have an event so that is good. It may be that over time you may have to adjust to these unwanted side effects, but that''s all they are, you are asymptomatic at this time and hopefully always. I am wondering if maybe the shortness of breath and increase HR may be some anxiety added to the situation that's why I mentioned anxiety meds. The treatment could have worsened the symptoms but you are hemodynamically stable, no fainting or passing out so I doubt very much in your case this is the cause and your ECG is  stable with medication. The data indicates that sudden cardiac death( SCD) rarley occurs \"suddenly out of the blue\" which suggests that it is important to give at risk patients and families detailed information about signs so they can recognize warning signs (like your ICD going off so you can react accordingly. It appears you have a strong family history of this VT so chances would be high you would pass this gene on, but with gene therapy evolving virtually day to day there is much to be optimistic about.  Best Wishes,  Paul\n\n",

As for the anti anxiety drugs I will try without them because I am not used to taking so many drugs and this is the first time that I am on medication. Never had any problems before. If I still find that I'm not able to cope with the stress I think I will have to take them I suppose.  As you said as long as the machine is there, there is nothing to worry about. As for my mother, she has undergone Holter test and we should be getting the reports by today. Lets see how they are.  She has never had any symptoms till now and lets hope it  remains that way.

    "content": "Doctor, I had not told you this before because you may think as if I'm losing my mind. It has happened two times now during the night.  I have gotten up with the feeling of my heart beating very strongly along with very strong palpitations. The beating is so strong that I can hear my own heart beat when this happened. The pulse becomes random and some times drastically increases its pace and then it becomes kind of normal( the palpitation and the strong beat still persisting). But then it finally picks up the pace steadily until it becomes so fast that there is no gap between the pulses and its extremely fast. Then I don't feel my heartbeat any more and then after that I don't feel my body and finally I think I lose consciousness. After not much time, I don't know exactly how much, suddenly I regain consciousness along with my body getting very warm specially in my arms. I also can now hear and feel my body properly. But I still feel the palpitations for a few minutes, though not as strongly as before and  having a normal pace. I then feel chest discomfort and breathing difficulty along with a slight  pain in the center of my chest for the whole day.            The first time this happened I didnt open my eyes but instead tried to control my heartbeat but to no avail.Also although I could feel my body lying on the bed I was unable to move.        The second time this happened I tried to open my eyes but could only do so for a few seconds as It was very difficult and exhausting to do so. Also when i opened my eyes i could see but with darkness surrounding the border of my vision just like before you faint. I also tried to call for help but the sound that left me was very weak. I could also feel my throat vibrating when i spoke. I also tried to move but could move only very little. So in short the second time this happened I was sure I was hundred percent awake.             I thought that the ICD was used both the times but when the doctor checked it, when i went to his clinic, he said that there had been no episodes and the machine was also working fine, which  was a very shocking along with a slightly good news to me. Also my ecg was coming fine when i met. But im now very confused as to what is happening with me. Is this my mind or is something really happening. I'm unable to accept that I had been imagining or dreaming all this because i can swear and say i was perfectly awake both the times. Is there any explanation for all this or am I really losing it. Also I am not that kind of a person who takes pleasure in creating trouble. With all the suffering I have had to bear lately , this heart problem is now driving me insane.   Your help will be gratefully appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry for the absence, but I have been doing huge amounts of studying as I am taking  university courses. To answer your question, you aren't crazy. What has and is happening to you is a traumatic event not unlike PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder). I am not a psychiatrist, but your episodes could have a psychological component to them. I would suggest some counseling so you can talk with someone about what is going on. Psychiatrist can prescribe medications while a psychologist can not. I would start out with a psychologist or counselor since medications have side effects and you don't want that. I believe in your case cognitive therapy, i.e. talking, expressing your feelings etc..should be considered first.  Good luck, Paul\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  First,  there's no reason anyone who is not known to be allergic to Cipro should not take it, including people who already have PVCs (and we all do at some  time or another,  some more than others). It's also important to learn how to decode the drug information sheets that come with medications. In the case of Cipro, what you've seen is \"Additional medically important events that occurred in less than 1% of ciprofloxacin patients are listed below,\" followed by a  bunch of random medical events unrelated, by any known mechanism, to the drug itself. It is requisite that any untoward event reported by a patient in a drug study group be listed in this way, even though there may be  no earthly explanation for why it might be connected to the drug. This paragraph usually follows one that has already described the known potential adverse  side effects. Most people assume this means  the things listed in the second paragraph are \"associated\" with use of the drug in question,  but that's not the case. These things were merely mentioned by the patients in a given study or studies as having happened (they are required to do this, and it must be included in the literature).   So no, no problem with using Cipro unless you know you are specifically allergic to ciprofloxacin. Hope this answers your question. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Is there a family history of Long Q-T or of sudden death? If not, you're not looking like a prime candidate, although I don't have enough information to use the scoring system that's used to help decide whether a person is likely to have it or not.   Since you've had some episodes of V-tach, do you know if they were the type known as torsade des pointes?  The reason I ask is that this is specific to the diagnosis of long-QT as well as a number of other things.   I find it interesting that your doctor would have you perform a stress test but feels an angiogram would be \"madness.\" The stress test is, well, more stressful than the angiogram, although the risks are about even. You did well on the stress test, so maybe that's why she doesn't want to go any further with the testing. The symptoms are worrisome, but I think it's important to either feel you can trust your doctor or else get a second opinion.  Coronary heart disease and hereditary long Q-T are not relatead (although a person with a compromised heart can develop prolonged Q-T interval temporarily). Your interval of 452 is right on the edge between normal and long.    I hope I've helped shed some light  on this for you. Please follow up with  us as needed,  and if you have any other information to share, that would be great.\n\n",

There is no history of sudden death at a young age in the family. My episode of v tach was a non sustained 10 beat run of monophoric vt of 232 beats per minute.My t-waves were inverted directly before and directly after the vt. I had a dynamic repolirisation change prior to onset of vt. 3 cardiologists have said there is no need for angiogram so I suppose I should trust them it is difficult though when I am getting the symptoms.

    "content": "You're very welcome.  I'll just make a few observations on your long Q-T diagnosis, based on the information you've supplied: generally this is a genetic trait, so if there's no family history, there may be some other, correctable cause for it. It also usually produces the distinctive torsade de pointes (\"twisted points\") complexes that are considered more ominous than regular, monomorphic V-tach. Finally, 232 bpm is a remarkably rapid rate for V-tach (not unheard of, but unusual to say the least). I'm wondering if it might not actually have been an atrial tachycardia with aberrant conduction, which looks almost identical to V-tach but upon close examination usually will disclose some p-waves hidden in the complexes. At the rate of 232 bpm it might be very hard to pick out the p-waves, though.  I don't mean to take issue with the diagnosis, but there are so many things about this particular instance which are fairly unusual that it makes me wonder if something else isn't going on. Hopefully you are followed for this on a regular basis, and recieve medication (often a beta blocker can help correct the interval and offer some protection against dangerous arrhythmias).   If you have no other signs or symptoms of coronary artery disease then the angiogram wouldn't be of much practical value, since it looks mainly at the structure of the heart and especially the condition of the arteries supplying it. However, yes, if there is any ischemia going on, the Reveal monitor would likely (not 100 per cent certainly, but very likely) show some indication of it.   Hopefully this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  Just to update you on recent developments, the last time I saw cardiologist he suggested beta blockers, bisoprolol however I have not taken them as I am concerned re the side effects as my heart rate would be on the low side of normal. Howver he does not seem concerned with thisso should I try them? On my loop recorder I have had 2 episodes of 9 beats of supra ventricular tachycardia Is this of concern? I am attending the cardiologist every 3 months. I still however am very worried even though they have resasurred me that my negative ep study was a good sign. Wondering what you mean that you wonder whether something else is going on? My ecg shows pr interval towards the lower limits at 122 milliseconds with no pre exicition. Qrs duaration and morophology was normal with slight prominence of the r waves in V1 and V2. Also non specific st segment sagging in the inferior leads in leads v4 to v6.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Beta blocker drugs are very good prophylactic measure regarding Long Q-T, and the slowed pulse shouldn't be a problem. In fact, that sometimes is part of the solution to the problem.   The 9-beat run of SVT isn't a concern unless you feel these and they bother you. Again, beta blocking drugs should help prevent or minimize the occurrence of this. In fact, if the SVT is conducted with abberrancy, it can look like V-tach, and would probably reach a higher rate. While an EP specialist should be able to recognize this if it's the case, it's something to consider also.  The \"something else\" I was thinking of was that the prolonged Q-T interval could be acquired due to some medication or even an electrolyte imbalance, such as often takes place in the setting of dehydration or a lack of potassium in the diet. These are things that presumably have been covered, but may not have been.   The EP study does sound reassuring, and this may indicate that the initial finding was due to some acquired, passing situation that's now corrected itself. Still, to err on the side of safety, I'd probably go with the beta blocker, at least a trial of a week or two, and if the side effects aren't significant, then keep it up. (If they are bothersome, which sometimes happens, please contact your doctor before discontinuing the drug, assuming you do start taking it).  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  I think  I can clear up this mystery for you. It's funny (well, maybe not funny, but interesting) how some medical people look at things without the patient's viewpoint figured in.   Your Holter monitor report, while very good, actually, also most certainly does explain your palpitations. It states very clearly there were a few premature atrial contractions (PACs) and some occasional,  isolated premature ventricular beats as well. No sinus pauses (all the better), and a generally very normal and unremarkable set of findings, except -- you feel the occasional PACs and  PVCs, and some of us perceive these as \"fluttering\" or something else that feels like  more than just an isolated event. No one has been able to account for this entirely, although in some cases it can be due to a random pairing of premature beats,which just didn't  happen during your particular monitored period.   Neither has anyone as yet advanced a convincing theory as to why some of us feel every premature beat (or even other activity that doesn't even produce ectopy),  while others never feel any of it, even those whose every-other beat is a PVC!   The  good news is that this is  a very good,  very normal, healthy result, but the problem is in the perception, and anxious people are more tuned in to what's going  on with their bodies, especially their hearts (I personally am perplexed by the fact that some people are unaware of these things -- I feel every one). What's important is that just about everyone has some of this,  some have more than others, some feel them more than others,  but in no case are PVCs and isolated  PACs of any medical significance whatsoever. This, unfortunately, doesn't mean just telling you that will prevent you from reacting reflexively when you feel one (or a series of them, which still doesn't mean anything as a rule). While it may help, there's no guarantee that knowing this is normal will  make you more able to ignore them (or forget them more quickly). You suffer from something  much more troublesome than premature beats: you suffer from anxiety.   Anxiety is a very real and often disabling problem. The fact that it can precipitate more premature beats than one might  otherwise normally feel (and there's no rule there -- again, some people have thousands of them per day while  others have them only rarely) just complicates the issue. It's not your fault! I do believe it's a doctor's responsibility to reassure the patient by explaining what's there and why it's not significant and that's what I, no doctor, am trying  to do here. Working on the anxiety problem  will, if successful, minimize the seeming importance you perceive in the premature beats. Trust me, one can  change the other, and perception really is everything.   I hope very much this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here as needed. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

I wish you every success. The fact that you're so aware of what's going on suggests you're more likely to pull this off on your own. I certainly hope so.  There's nothing in your Holter report to suggest any reason for concern about getting your rate too high or setting off a rapid tachyarrhythmia. Should anything funny turn up that leaves you wondering, we're here to help sort it out, but I doubt you'll have any problems like that.  My best to you.\n\n",

It may be uncomfortable, and it probably suggests some other thing that needs correcting (and which if corrected would result in a normalizing of the heart rate), but no, in itself a rapid heart rate will not cause damage to the heart. It can, however, not only feel unpleasant but can contribute to fatigue in some people.   Hope this answers your question to your satisfaction.  Please follow up with us as needed.

This figure is defintely my correct resting pulse (not just temporary), since the same figure was recorded over a number of days at a number of times.  I have heard that anything over 100 is abnormal, so a resting of pulse of 97, although not pathological, is certainly unusually high. [ Additional Info: I'm male, 37, average weight, and my blood pressure is 130/77 - high average , no known heart problems]  I've learned that studies have shown that a high resting pulse is a risk factor for heart problems, the higher the resting pulse the greater the chances of a heart attack (however these studies were on people who had previous heart conditions, so it's not known if the same is true for healthy people).  Can anyone explain to me the wide variations in normal resting pulse (50-100) and tell me if I should be concerned with my own normal but high resting pulse of 97?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again -  The range of \"normal\" for heart rate is based on a spectrum of averages of healthy people, and is quite broad, mainly because during the coure of a typical day our rates do vary a lot from morning to night (and during the night as well), depending on a lot of factors. What may be normal for one person isn't normal for another, and the range of 50 or 60 (depending on which book you're reading) to 100 is really fairly arbitrary. Much of the average rate of an individual would be based on height, ,weight, body mass index, innate metabolic rate, and any transient stressors, illnesses, etc. So you can see there is naturally a lot of variation.   While the textbook average \"normal\" heart rate is 72, that's a ridiculous number in reality. By the same token,  if your average rate tends toward the lower end of the spectrum and becomes faster for a while, the cause could be anything from a change in metabolic rate to thyroid disease, etc. The fact remains that while it is sometimes suggestive of something having changed, it's not a definitive marker for anything (other than fever, which almost always will make the rate faster).  While it's true an accellerated resting heart rate is of some concern in people with certain types of heart disease, even this has so many qualifiers to it that it's not much use as a diagnostic sign, and in otherwise healthy people an increased rate won't cause any damage to the heart, although it can reflect (as a symptom or sign) that there is already some damage or disease present.   If your resting rate of 97 (average?) is normal for you, then it's fine. If it reperesents a change from normal for you, and it is consistently up near the high end of normal (which isn't cut precisely at 100, either, but they have to draw a line somewhere for reference purposes), then it may reflect a metabolic problem, anemia, a passing viral infection, or a metabolic shift. If cardiological workups show no problems then the rate itself is not the primary concern, and if there's no serious underlying illness present, then it's fine to have an average resting rate up around 100.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Impotence & Norpace",
    "content": "Hi there -  You're perfectly right to be concerned about this. The loss of intimacy places a big burden on the relationship. This  is an unusual but not real surprising side effect. Some beta blockers (as Toprol is) can cause this problem, but Toprol (metaprolol) is one of those far less likely to cause it.   Then there's Norpace. The drug does have some possibly potent and annoying side effects, including drying of mucosal surfaces (including the urethra), untoward effects on the prostate, and the two together can cause  a drop in blood pressure (as can Viagra, but that at least sends the  blood where it's needed, unlike most drugs that just drop the pressure uniformly and can cause impotence or weakened drive). Norpace, in particular, is known to cause genitourinary problems in males. Your husband really should discuss this with his doctor and if he gets the same \"either/or\" argument, he might want to consider a second opinion. All the Class 1A and 1C antiarrhythmic drugs used for management of atrial fibrillation all have potentially serious side effects, but primarily in patients who've had a prior heart  attack. The other drugs (such as encainide and flecainide) have the same risk in this regard as Norpace (disopyramide), but they don't have near the rate of complaints regarding genitourinary problems  and impotence. These are reasonable alternatives to Norpace. The only difference is that Norpace, along with beta blockers such as Toprol, does have the additional side effect of slight weakening of the heart muscle, something one doesn't usually find to be desireable, but in cases of IHSS it actually helps. However, changing  to a different (Class 1C) antiarrhythmic and increasing the dose of beta blocker should have the same net result and should control  the a-fib equally well. (Of course there's no guarantee this will happen,   and  your husband himself may be  averse to trying a different drug on the off-chance it may upset his thus-far good anti-arrhythmic result).   It's a tough situation, but I would think your husband would miss the intimacy as much as you do at least, and so would be motivated to correct the situation if possible. It is possible. I hope he'll consider looking into the alternatives to Norpace, which I strongly suspect is the culprit here.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed and keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 28 year old female with no prior extraordinary medical history.  I have had 2 normal healthy pregnancies.  Non-smoker, occasional drinker. After an emergency CT scan because of sudden stomach pain in Feb. 2008, they found I was almost completely blocked by a tumor, and I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Colon Cancer, had a colon resection (18 inches of upper colon resected).  I went through a round of chemo (Folfox), and handled it well.  I am about to have surgery to biopsy some spots they found on my lungs.  If it turns out to be cancer, then it will be another round of chemo. As far back as I can remember, I have had a very rapid heart beat (I remember getting over 100 bpm in elementary), heavy sweating, and shortness of breath.  (My mother has Paroximal Atrial Tachycardia, and taught me how to \"bear down\" to help slow the heart rate, which used to help.) The irregular heartbeats seemed to get worse with each pregnancy, then really bad with chemo, so I was sent for an EKG and Holter monitor.  They told me I had a hyper-dynamic left ventricular systolic function, extra heart muscle, irregular heartbeat pattern, and the arrythmia happened about 5+ times per hour on average.  (I can promise it happens WAY more often than that.)  With the flutter, I seem to get short of breath, dizzy, and uncomfortable.  No pain or fainting, but it's just like I am on a roller coaster ride constantly. The heart doctors didn't seem too concerned about any of this, and didn't have any advice on how to handle it. My question is this:  Would it be helpful for me to be tested for Hyperthyroidism, and could this be the cause of the irregular heartbeats, sweating, dizziness, shortness of breath?   And could the chemo have made this worse, and would more chemo make it even worse?  Are there any bad long term effects of this irreegular heartbeat? I know this is complicated, but thank you for your help and time.\n\n",

You are very brave and an inspiration to lots of people by virtue of having placed your post here, showing that one can beat cancer and rise above it.

This can sometimes take a while to return to pre-pregnancy levels. The same holds true quite often for the effects of chemo, for slightly different reasons.   I would  point out that while  you may have been abnormally aware of your heartbeat for a long time, a \"normal\" rate is considered anywhere between 60 and 100 beats per minute, and generally the upper end or slightly higher when one is younger, so a resting heart rate of 100 or more in elementary school is actually unremarkable. The  fact that you're aware of your rate and rhythm is more a matter of perception, and many people are very sensitive and attuned to their heartbeats, whereas others may have grossly irregular beating and not even be aware of it.   It certainly wouldn't hurt to be tested for hyperthyroidism if your heart rate continues to be higher than average for your age, size, etc., but your doctors have probably not assigned any of this that high a priority. Still, it wouldn't hurt to ask, as this can sometimes cause additional premature heartbeats, faster-than-average heart rate, etc.   The Holter monitor findings actually would suggest possible thyroid involvement, as it often causes what is called \"high-output heart failure\", which is a lot more innocent than it sounds,  and is often associated with \"hyperdynamic left ventricular function.\" This, in itself, isn't necessarily a problem, but if the extra \"oomph\" the heart uses is  caused by elevated thyroid function, treating that might make you feel more relaxed about the whole thing.   In short, this sounds very benign, but if it's bothering you then you need to persue it, and if your heart rate (the rhythm is \"normally abnormal\") is consistently above average, there are things that may be possible to help out with that, especially if you are hyperthyroid.  There are no long term detrimental effects caused by a higher-than-average heart rates nor by otherwise innocent arrhythmias and premature heartbeats, even though they feel really strange and disturbing sometimes. These things are actually very benign and relatively normal.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck , and please do follow up with us as needed here.\n\n",

    "title": "\"Prominent\" Sinus Arrhytmia w/ \"Borderline\" changes",
    "content": "I'm a 26yo Cauc female who was dx with sinus arryhthmia and sinus tach in 2003 from an EKG showing HR variability from 83-111. In 2005 worsening palpataions and fatigue led my primary to refer me to cardiologist. The stress echocardiogram was negative but there were parts I'm still concerned about: My HR went to 196bpm after 6min only going 4.0mph, this is consistent with my current exercise intolerance ie last time on the eliptical my HR reached 202bpm, and I had to stop.  Also, trace MR trace TR, are these considered normal? What was grossly normal was my EF of>65% So with the cardiologist said that my heart was strong but I hadn't grown out of the normal SA that kids typically have with respirations and that specifically mine was more prominent, also if my ST was out of control later on I might need BBlockers. I accepted this and decided that I was going to have to tolerate and get used to feeling the frequent drops and rises of my HR.   About a year ago in Dec 07, I got off night shift, lied down and felt a sudden sinking feeling, then rapid HR and SOB like I was at a high altitiude, I went to the ER. My heart rate was very irreg from 80's to 130's but all sinus. No CP. Sats 98-99, CXR norm, Ddim neg, doc said you have obvious SA, no PE, and this attack looked \"caffeine induced\" ( I had been drinking alot of caffeine working nights) So I stopped drinking coffee and very rarely have even soda. Then in April 08, I had gone to the gym for this first time since I injured my foot a year before and had to stop due to nausea ,dizziness, and palps. I lied down and after 15 minutes with still no relief I went to the ER, they put me on the monitor and my HR was still 140's, EKG ST, CK 266 obviously from the exercise, otherwise labs WNL. When my HR slowed down the got another EKG HR 84, SA. But I was still nauseated and had Orthostatic tachy so they had me stay and gave me IV Zofran which caused a brief run SVT strip and warm sensation, so they said I was sensitive to the med. Anyhow Doc told me to stay away from aggressive exercising.  Which brings me to now, I've had 2 ER encounters within a month, and both times I was simply sitting at my computer. I was never told I had anxiety or panic attacks, I'm thinking because my HR was never consistently tachy, and it was obviously SA. So I decided to order a pulse oximeter and hopefully catch what was going on if and should it ever occur again. When it occurred again I put on my oximtetry. My HR was irreg from 90's to 130's and again when I felt a sinking feeling the reading dropped off showing no values, then picked up at 52,70's,90's,100's...all the way to 178 within seconds, along with my sats hanging around 94-95% eventually going back to 99%. Again ER, EKG ST with borderline repol w/ st dep/abnorm T. Labs ok, CXR clear, Ddim 1.0, Trop neg. Referred to cards, wore a holter for 24hr, no events but prelim showed SA with prominent HR fluctuation even during sleep.   Again even though results were neg or normal, these things concern me:  Last three potassiums 3.1, 3.4, 3.5; Na 132, 134, 135- and this one was very peculiar as I had just finished half a bag of salt and vinegar chips that day. Also all my EKG's have been \"borderline\" And when looking back I'm concerned about the QTc of .448(HR 112)and .41(HR 84).   These symptoms are interrupting my life and seem to becoming more frequent. I feel like these \"borderline\" and \"prominent\" terms might lead to something worse one day. My dad has Afib/flutter, his parents both died from MI/CAD, and my mom's dad had a one time fatal MI in his 50's. The only med I'm on is Yaz for 3months now, before that other BC. I have a follow up appt with the Cardiologist to discuss my Holter results and I want to be prepared with appropriate questions and/or suggestions for further testing.  Any input is greatly appreciated, thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  \"Prominent\" SA in an otherwise healthy young person, with symptoms you describe and largely negative findings (those \"borderline\" things duly noted) is usually due to one of two or three things: you may have dysautonomia, a condition where the autonomic nervous system responds to various stimuli (such as positional changes, exercise, etc.) inappropriately; neurocardiogenic syncope (whereing the  barostat receptors malfunction, causing BP to drop inappropriately, with reflex tachycardia intervening to compensate); or sick sinus syndrome (SSS), which involves alternating too-slow with too fast heart rates, and can eventually progress to the point where the patient's heart gets too slow and a pacemaker has to be implanted. However, you also seem to have one of those rather mysterious metabolic problems where potassium levels will not hold despite a normal diet, hydration, etc. This may be related or may be a separate problem, but it certainly would be worthwhile to try treating this first, since patients with arrhythmias (and SA is an arrhythmia) are generally preferred to have something better than the bottom of \"normal\" or below normal K levels. A time-release form of K probably should be tried for a few weeks to see if this helps correct the larger problem. Low levels of K would explain the T-wave abnormalities.   Your Q-T interval, at least once, was over-long, which can be an acquired problem with too-low potassium levels, so this really should be persued first. If the tachy-brady problem persists after stabilizing K levels,   Neurocardiogenic syncope can be ruled out (or in) via tilt table testing. SSS can also sometimes be determined by tilt table testing, as well as collective observed signs and  symptoms, of which you seem to have many. When an adult fails to outgrow the normal pediatric SA, it often is because it has morphed into SSS. This needs to be followed with an eye toward correction, especially if K replacement doesn't correct this particular part of the cluster of symptoms.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I am a 33 year old smoker, 108 lb female who's been experiencing chest pains for the last couple years. However, it recently (the last year) gotten progressively worse.   My symptoms, (although I'm not sure if they are all related) are:  starts as like a  squeezing in my chest about an inch and a half to 2 inches from the top center of my chest (a couple inches down from the end of my collar bone. I don't know how to describe it other than that... it isn't sharp- it kind of reminds me how my arm feels in a blood pressure cuff) difficulty getting a deep breath left shoulder aching then the left arm tingles almost like it's falling asleep, but not quite as it goes numb lightheaded- which have led to fainting  sweaty and sometimes queasy sometimes, only more rare, sudden headache at the bottom left side of my head  I went to my GP and upon my arrival, he was quick to dismiss it as anxiety. Finally, He put an EKG on me and sent me to a cardiologist that week siting signs of a junctional rhythm.  At my cardiologist, his EKG there revealed a dip before my my QRS wave and a long pause after my S.( I think he said) He said he wasn't sure what it meant. Said he wanted to see the results of the 24 hour before deciding. 24 hour came back as follows: (the overview)  The average heart rate was 78. The maximum heart rate was 122. Pauses greater than 2.5 seconds were 6. Ventricular ectopy was 565 with 18 V-Runs and 43 V- Pairs. Ventricular Bigeminy  events were 1 and ventricular trigeminy events were 0. Superventricular ectopy was 88 with  0 SV Runs. 0 Superventricular Bigeminy events. 0 Superventricular Trigeminy events. Total A-Fib were 0 Mins 0 Secs. ST episode minutes totaled 4. The maximum Delta ST change was -1.4.  During my follow up to go over these results, the doctor did not have the results available, he had to get them faxed over, did not look at my blood work until I suggested it (which only showed a high sugar level of 108) and seemed rushed, so much so that he didn't even print the results of the EKG until I asked him to. After that, he proceeded to tell me all the areas that looked erratic were most likely artifact. And that the reading had to have been wrong or a computer glitch. He said he would do a stress test to make me feel better, but seemed relatively unphased by my concerns about these things I am experiencing. My father has heart disease, and strokes, and dimentia  and  had a triple bypass in his late 40's. My grandmother had medication for a high pulse rate as well as my great grandmother. My mother has a mitral valve prolapse, although mine seemed normal.   My GP requested a 30 day Holter Monitor from my Cardiologist. I am ok with that, and am going to the second part of my nuclear stress test tomorrow. My echo only revealed a mild regurgitation.  I worry that something is wrong, as when it happens, it can last minutes, or it can last hours. When it lasts hours is when it's most frightening as I'm worried it won't stop or that it will worsen. It has progressed to being something I experience on a daily basis, rather than every couple weeks. I don't want to have one of these things come on when I am driving or whatnot... the loss of consciousness frightens me.  Do you have any advice your insight you could offer? I'd greatly appreciate it.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Junctional Rhythm Mild Regurgitation and Chest Pains",
    "content": "Hi there -  The  symptoms you describe are disturbing enough, but are difficult to attach to the EKG/Holter monitor findings. The description of the resting EKG, as passed along by you, suggest you may have some sort of pre-existing damage (that \"dip\" before the QRS complex sounds  like a Q-wave, which can show up for no good reason, but often suggests prior injury). The dip also could have been a delta wave, which  would indicate a less worrisome, but still problematic electrical problem that is readily fixable, called Wolfe-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The pause between the S and T waves indicates an electrical abnormality, which is certainly borne out by your Holter monitor report.  It's difficult to say what exactly is going on, but there is something abnormal in electrical pathway. How this ties in with the symptoms is difficult to know at a distance.   You have a family history of early heart disease, which is never a good thing. This may have absolutely nothing to do with what's happening to you, but it's always a big red flag,  and nothing you've told us here would suggest your problem is anxiety-based, although you're probably feeling some very reasonable anxiety as to what may be wrong.   You may need to find another cardiologist. This one's  attitude toward you,  which is often seen in regard to young, otherwise healthy women, is not a good start. He's been dismissive and less than attentive. I'm also curious as to how you're having a nuclear scan/stress test done in two parts on two different days. Could you explain  this to me? I'd really appreciate it.   You could have something as simple as mitral valve prolapse (MVP) even though it didn't show up on echo (it often does not), but even if you do, this sounds as though it may be a more complex syndrome than usually seen with that. The family history   concerns me,  and  of course  loss  of consciousness always concerns me, as does relatively typical chest pain. The EKG abnormalities (I'd love to see the actual tracing) concerns me. The Holter monitor report  is problematic. There is plenty enough here to warrant a one-day, comprehensive nuc scan/stress test at least. You may need a consult with an electrophysiolgist as well (specialist in arrhythmias). Something just isn't right. It may not be terribly serious, but it's definitely disruptive and you deserve proper care, diagnosis and management of anything this disruptive, serious or not.   I hope this is of some help. I don't mean  to cause you to worry more, and please bear in mind that this has been going on for a while without progressing much,  so it's probably not anything terrible, but it certainly deserves a long, hard look and the appropriate tests and exams. Please update us on the  \"second part\" of your stress test (that really troubles me) and follow up with us as needed. Best of luck to you. Hopefully you'll know a lot more real  soon.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Dronedarone and heart ablation for atrial fibrillation",
    "content": "Hello Bernie -  First, I assume you realize the chances are atrial fibrillation is what caused your two TIAs and the stroke. It's wonderful that  you recovered from the stroke so thoroughly!   Now then: with atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation often can correct the problem, but if not, then there are a number of medications that can be used to control AF. Flecainide does often have some noxious side effects in certain people, and Sotolol tends to be the drug of choice in those who tolerate it (some people do experience pretty annoying side effects, bad enough that they have to go off it as you did).   Neither of the drugs you've been on, nor any cardiac problem you currently have would seem to account for the balance problems, dizziness and other seemingly neurological symptoms you're having, and they are probably more related to the stroke than medication (and clearly not the result of any failure of the heart's function).  However, flecainide has fallen out of disfavor because of potentially serious side effects.   The reason your doctor is hesitant to prescribe dronedarone may be simply because it is still under development and hasn't been  approved, so far as I know, for general use as yet. However, if you could get approved for it on an experimental basis, it  does seem to be one of the better drugs developed to control AF and so far all its clinical trials have it looking  like it will be  approved and will be extremely popular due to the low incidence of side effects. If your GP recommends it then you should be qualified to receive the drug, but I guess your cardiologist could block this. It also may be that your ablation was totally successful and that you no longer have AF, in which case you wouldn't need any medications to control it. If you do still suffer from AF after the ablation and your GP agrees about dronaredone, then perhaps he can argue on your behalf that you be allowed a trial use of the drug, as it has also done well in US studies and will very likely be approved for general use soon.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.  Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I am new to this board and I searched it far and wide prior to asking my question.   I am a 40 year old woman, suffering no anxiety or stress, and two weeks ago I started experiencing frequent 'palpitations'. I know that most often these are quite normal and harmless and I have had them on a very rare occasion previously.   The first day it happened, the palpitation would knock the air out of my lungs and I would cough; particularly if it happened while I was speaking. Kind of like being kicked in the chest. I ignored it initially but it is happening more than 100 times per day every day over and over again. It matters not whether I am active or sedentary; it even occurs while I am in bed and has woken me up from sleep. My heart rate is in normal range, about 76 bpm. When an attack (which is what it feels like) hits me, I have to cough sometimes as it forces air out of my lungs. I don't want to go to the doctor if it is nothing, but I don't want to ignore it if it is important.   I am a non-smoker and drink very lightly (less than 1 alcoholic beverage per week). No new medications, maybe 1 or 2 cups of coffee per day. My family does have a history of heart disease (my mother had several heart attacks and my father had a stroke) but they were all smokers; which I am not and never have been  Any advice is greatly appreciated as it has happened over 10 times since I began writing this (it has taken me less than 5 minutes)  Thank you, Dy\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 100+ Palpitations per day causing cough",
    "content": "Hello Dy,  First, you're correct, premature heartbeats, be they ventricular or atrial in origin, are harmless. We all have them sometimes, and some of us are acutely aware of them, while others never feel a single one (I must say I envy those people). They may come and go or become more frequent on occasion, then go away for no apparent reason. The list of benign causes of these annoying sensations is at least as long as your arm. Among items on that list would be any number of medications. One of those can  be Amitriptyline, just FYI.  The \"kick in the chest\" sensation is frequently reported, usually with some alarm. Part of the reason this happens -- for some people -- is that the timing of the premature ventricular contraction (PVC -- these are usually the ones that are sometimes felt as a literal kick) can make it seem \"light\" of touch or a \"kick.\" The more violent-seeming ones usually have happened just at the moment when the tricuspid valve is closed, which does, in fact, take one's breath away for a moment. It's harmless, but that sensation just adds to the disturbing quality of the event. When the valve is closed the blood can't be pushed out to the lungs and causes both that \"stolen breath\" sensation, but often also what are called cannon A-waves in the neck, as the blood then regurgitates up the jugulars, causing a sense of momentary fullness in the neck.   All this can be really disturbing if the subject happens to experience a brief (or not-so-brief) run of ventricular bigemeny, where every other beat is, for a while, a PVC. If this isn't troubling enough (unless one has become used to it), if the pattern occurs so that each early beat happens when the tricuspid valve is closed (easy for this to happen, since the beat isn't happening when it's \"supposed\" to), the result can be a sense of shortness of breath and something bordering on chest pain or pressure -- until the pattern shifts or stops what it's doing. It's still harmless, but it is essentially like getting that \"kick\" in the chest about 30 times in a row, sometimes even more (some people  have bigemeny as their \"normal\" rhythm,  but these rarely notice it). I only mention this in passing, since anyone who has a spell of frequent or even occasional PVCs can also have a run of bigemeny and might feel quite alarmed if this sensation were new.   Premature atrial beats (which arise, as one might assume, in the atria instead of the ventricles) are sometimes perceived as less noxious,  because the atria (the upper chambers of the heart) are smaller. The beat still gets conducted to the ventricles, but the sensation is often has less \"punch\" to it. These,however,  may cause more of a \"fluttery\" sensation, which is also disturbing if it is  new. Bear in mind, also, that while  these sensations are benign and common, one doesn't notice them until  one day one does notice them. Once they've been noticed it's a little more difficult to get past that, but if they get frequent enough most people do begin to ignore them.    Hopefully this will quiet down soon. Some people have this  on a daily basis, but just remember, no matter how weird they feel, they are benign. About all we can do to minimize them is try to relax, cut out caffeine (or at least accept that caffeine will cause them or make them more frequent), and if they become relentless and produce a lot of anxiety, they can be reduced in frequency and force by use of a beta blocker (a medication that slows the heart rate and reduces the force of the heart's contractions). This is something available when the problem just becomes intolerable.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this.\n\n",

    "title": "Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia Symptoms (IST)",
    "content": "Hi DoctorsLounge,  I'm a 19 year old male, and trying to figure out what exactly is wrong with my heart. For over a year (since the night of November 23rd, 2007), I've been having these weird symptoms.  After seeing three (!) different cardiologists over the period, one suggested IST (Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia). Through further research, it seems incredibly similar to what I am experiencing. My current symptoms are:  * Consistently fast heart rate (~100 BPM) even at rest, although some nights it seems to slow to ~80 BPM. * Periodic chest pain, sometimes sharp, others constraining and chest \"pressure\" * Out of breath most times * Increased fatigue * Intolerance to exercise or any type of physical activity, even walking up a few stairs (greatly increasing rate, likely to 140+) * I ALWAYS feel my pulse/heart beat, and it drives me crazy (24/7) ** With exercise, it's even stronger, and quite scary  Those are the main things. A little prologue: I woke up on the stated date to a very fast heart rate (150+) that night, which would trigger my heart to go fast (like a switch) off and on that week. Once it stayed fast for 24 hours, I went to emerge. They put my on a beta-blocker (Bisoprolol), which had terrible side-effects for 10 days of its use; then I came off from it. Before all of this, I was a relatively healthy individual with a moderately-healthy diet, some exercise (generally in summer months), and a HR of about 60-65 BPM when resting.  Since then, I've had every test under the sun that I can think of, or that's been recommended. Stress tests, blood tests, urine, multiple 48-hour holters, stress echocardiograms, x-rays, and more. I have also checked for a stomach bacteria virus (h.pylori) in desperation. The only thing that was picked up in relation to the heart is a valve that is somewhat \"floppy,\" but I highly doubt that's what's causing these problems. Apparently, I was told 1% of the world's population has it.  My most recent cardiologist has prescribed Propanolol (5 mg twice daily), another beta-blocker, to ease the symptoms. However, I'm reluctant to take it with my past experiences.  As it stands, there's not much I can do. I assume my options are to:  1) Take the medication, and likely a calcium channel blocker (/any other medications), for my entire life. 2) Undergo radiofrequency ablation, something I am not willing to do at this point. This is my last alternative. 3) Try and \"live with\" the symptoms my entire life, hoping it gets better.  I am scheduled to see an arrhythmia specialist in 3-4 months (it takes long here in Canada), so I'll know officially then. At this point, it looks quite like IST. What's odd is, it seems to be mostly middle-aged women that get this disease (?), me being the opposite.  This is driving me nuts, and SEVERELY affecting my University performance (which is a whole other story). I have officially run out of hope and faith, and have no idea what is causing this. Most doctors that see me refer it to a \"Medical Mystery,\" then simply stop caring.  Any sort of advice, or direction, would be greatly appreciated. I only pray that one has heard of this before, and can guide me in the right path to health once again. Thank you in advance for your time, and I look forward in hearing a response.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia Symptoms (IST)",
    "content": "Hello -  While the diagnosis of IST is almost certainly accurate, it is often only a symptom and not a proper diagnosis, as there is usually an underlying cause. While everyone you've seen has dismissed the obvious, I'm  going to mention it again, anyway, because this fits the picture (as well as a few other things): you mention one exam revealing  \"only\"  that one of your heart's valves was \"a little floppy.\" This is known as mitral valve prolapse (MVP), and actually probably more like 10-15% of the general population has it. It is often dismissed as a \"variant of normal\",  but some individuals can have along with it a well-recognized syndrome (MVP syndrome or MVPS), and some people are even diagnosed with MVPS without having the actual prolapse proven (and it can be hard to prove sometimes, since it may appear or disappear intermittently, that \"floppiness\"). They caught it with you, then totally dismissed it as a potential cause of your symptoms.   Now comes the strange part: no one is really clear as to why people with MVP often develop annoying cardiac-related symptoms, since no one has advanced a convincing theory as to why the floppy valve (we can do away with the quote marks, as \"floppy valve\" is a clinical term anyway) is usually seen in association with the syndrome. However, it's been  recognized since 1963, so it's not exactly a new phenomenon, but some doctors do remain reluctant to recognize the connection, there being no clear-cut cause and effect.   There is at least one major medical center in the US which has a large center dedicated solely to diagnosing and treating this sometimes infuriating problem. It is usually treated with beta blockers, sometimes with radio frequency catheter ablation (although in your case that doesn't seem appropriate based on what you've told us). Again, though,  the beta blocker you were first prescribed is not the one of choice for this problem,  at least not in the US. Bisoprolol is most often prescribed for control of elevated blood pressure, as it seems to have a greater effect on BP than other beta blockers. While some doctors consider all beta blockers essentially the same, they not only are not, but different people respond to different drugs differently, so please don't allow your bisoprolol experience to color your potential relief of symptoms because of it. That being said, propranolol has perhaps the highest rate of reported annoying side effects (it is also the oldest of the beta blocker family,  and is rarely used for the original purposes of blood pressure control and arrhythmia management now. It is, however, probably the cheapest).  Metaprolol, preferably long-acting,  once-a-day dosing version, is currently the first drug of choice in most practices in the US for problems such as yours. A concurrent calcium channel blocker also doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, at least to me. Further,  this is not necessarily something you'll have to take \"for the rest of your life\" although that seems to be a popular thing to tell people when putting them on certain types of medications.  It's almost never true due to the fact that not only do physiological things change, but so does pharmacology and technology. Metaprolol might well be a good starting point for you, though, and if it works and relieves most of your symptoms without causing too many untoward side effects, you could get to like it pretty quickly.  Hopefully the  electrophysiologist you will see in a few months will  be able to deal with this more appropriately than has been done so far. In the meantime, some suggestions would be: stay well-hydrated (drink more water than you normally would unless you're already a water fan), try to exercise regularly but ease into it and allow yourself to progress slowly. Also, consider what may have been going on in your life at the time of onset of the symptoms, since MVP, which usually announces itself in adolescence anyway, can often become  symptomatic after some stressful or traumatic event (physically or emotionally).   Finally, a floppy valve is sometimes actually a \"flail\" valve, although yours doesn't sound like it. Flail valve means the cord that  attaches the free end to the base of the  left ventrical is either broken or markedly stretched. This can cause more severe symptoms (and  they actually make sense physically) than \"regular\" MVP. While it really doesn't sound  like this is the case here, sometimes subsequent exams will show up things that weren't apparent the first time around, and flail valve is often a discrete physical event. This is very rare, and I only mention it in the interest of being thorough.  I don't think this applies in your case.   I hope this is helpful to you.  Best of luck to you and please follow up with us as needed. Also be sure to update us once you've seen the electrophysiologist.\n\n",

    "content": "Incredible. Never did I expect such a detailed and informative response. Thank you so much, John.  I was aware previously of MVP Syndrome, but I'm not quite sure I was told the floppy valve was in fact the \"mitral valve.\" If it had been, I'm sure it would have rang a bell. If anything I'll be sure to let you know, if you wish, what the precise valve was called. I believe an appointment with my Cardiologist is in January 2009. If it is MVP Syndrome, I'm less worried that I'll be living with this forever (since there are treatments available), and this so-called \"Medical Mystery\" may finally be solved.  I also forgot to add things in my original post, like not ever smoking, drinking, or doing any illegal drugs. All these things simply happened ... over night.  Thank goodness you mentioned Metaprolol. I was actually considering taking Propanolol, the new beta-blocker, until you mentioned it had a high rate of annoying side effects; which the main reason for my reluctance. I will hopefully get a prescription of Metaprolol in the future, and pray it eases my symptoms (with minimal side effects). I'm somewhat angered/disappointed that the emergency cardiologist first prescribed Bisoprolol, which as you stated, is generally to lower BP. My BP is almost always normal (and normal that day), except for a few instances where it is slightly low. Likely the reason my body reacted to negatively during that time period.  I am considering radio frequency catheter ablation, no matter how scary it may sound (I'm one you can't even watch these things on TV). If it finally gets officially diagnosed, and RFA seems like the best course of action, I may end up doing it. In your personal experiences, is the success rate as high as they say? Recovery time? I always get the feeling doctors are inflating the success rate when I read stories of those which it was unsuccessful, and are now living with a pacemaker.   Again, thank you so much (!) for your incredible response. Hopefully everything works out alright, and I overcome this obstacle in life. I will be sure to update you/DoctorsLounge once I have seen the electrophysiologist in the coming months. For now, it's all about focusing on school!   Take care, and best wishes!  Aaron\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Aaron,  You're very welcome. This is my area of greatest expertise (and not necessarily by choice, but I do like it), so I tend to get pretty detailed about it. :)  When I read \"floppy valve\" I assumed right away the reference was to the mitral valve, since one almost never hears the term applied to any of the others, although I'd still very much like to know if thats the one in question. The others are constructed differently, so aren't very prone to floppiness; they instead become narrowed, get vegetation on them, calcify or develop other problems. But we'll see.   I think a lot of \"system\" doctors try propranolol because it's generally effective and it's cheap but it's also more likely to make one feel lethargic and slowed down for some time before the body finally adjusts to it. Also, while there is now a time-release version, most often it's just prescribed plain, which means taking it 3-4 times per day instead of once as with most of the newer ones like metaprolol. Those newer ones are also less likely to aggravate existing asthma (if that should be a problem  for a given patient). It's become the drug of first choice for most doctors treating this sort of problem now, and it's also passed its generic date, so is available at far lower cost than when it went under brand name (Toprol XL) only.   If your tacharrhythmia is, in fact, \"just\" IST, I'm not quite sure how the ablation would work for you, since it isn't arising from an irritable focus the  way supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or atrial fibrillation (AF) (to name the two most popular paroxysmal arrhthmias) are. Those can be found and burned out via RF ablation, usually with no problem, although as you note, there is the occasional unintended (or sometimes deliberate) ablation of the AV node, which does  then require the patient to use a pacemaker for the duration. This is most  often deliberate nowadays, and usually to \"disconnect\" intractable AF, which thank  goodness you don't have. IST is usually due to some inexplicable derangement of the autonomic nervous system -- something that happens in various ways with MVPS -- but doesn't have an  identifiable \"target\" area for ablation. Of course the sinus node could be ablated, but then the patient would be pacemaker dependent forevermore, and the heart  rate would be  regulated that way. It doesn't seem like a practical idea, at least at this time. Your rate would probably be quite tolerable if you weren't so aware of it. Some people aren't. There's no accounting for that, either.  In general, when RF ablation is undertaken for the right reasons, the success rate is very high, although there is the occasional one that just won't work. Those are pretty rare, however. I'm just wondering how that would even fit into your treatment plan.   Again you're very welcome. Focusing on school is a great idea. Hopefully that will help distract you from  your heart's shenanigans. Best of luck to you and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 20 y/o A-FIB",
    "content": "Hi there -  While atrial fibrillation is, in and of itself not a serious arrhythmia, I'm sure you're aware of the main secondary problem it poses. You've been told you're at low risk for clots, which may or may not be correct, since no one can be certain when or for how long you're in A-fib (except for the documented 10 hour episode). A Holter monitor or, if you can feel the A-fib happening, an event monitor, would be a lot more helpful in determining what the frequency and average duration of episodes are. Still, this is probably not the biggest problem in your case.  What the greater problem may well be is that protracted A-fib is unsual in otherwise healthy young  men,  and usually has an underlying cause. Most often this underlying cause is something called Wolfe-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), where the subject is born with (or perhaps develops early in life) an accessory bypass tract that can redirect the impulses from  the atria (the upper two heart chambers, where the beat originates, in the sinus node in the right atria), directly to the ventricles without passing through the \"watchdog\" atrio-ventricular node (AV node) which lies between the upper and lower sets of chambers.   Why this can be a problem is, first, that for some reason people with this abnormal nerve tissue are also much more prone to develop A-fib. Again, in itself, this wouldn't be much of an issue in a young, otherwise healthy person, except, of course, for the possible risk of clots. However, because of the accessory bypass tract, the extremely fast and chaotic rate the atria beat at when in A-fib (normally geared down by passing through that AV node) can drive the ventricles to identical rates and rhythms, which may be intolerable and even life-threatening.   WPW needs to be conclusively ruled out for you. This is normally easy to do, because most of the time it is given away by a very conspicuous EKG abnormality called a delta wave. The delta wave is not always present in all cases, however, so one more reason the Holter monitor could be helpful in sorting this out. If WPW is present, people under 35 years of age are at greatest risk of developing a dangerous arrhythmia. By the same token, WPW is relatively simple to \"fix\", by means of catheter radio frequency ablation that destroys the accessory bypass connection and removes the risk.   Even if WPW is conclusively rule out, A-fib can be troublesome, bothersome, or at least uncomfortable.  It can accompany other types of heart abnormalities as well, and can often be cured by the same ablation method that WPW can. If possible,  it should be eliminated unless there is a known  precipitating cause such as periodic heavy alcohol consumption (there are a lot of people who have this problem only around the holidays, because they drink more than usual, which sets it off temporarily; This is known as \"holiday heart\"). At any rate, this definitely deserves further study and a comprehensive cardiac workup by a cardiologist. The stress echo would seem to have ruled out coronary artery disease and structural heart disease, and no one has noted delta waves (or else, as is sometimes the case, they have been noted but unfortunately dismissed as unimportant). WPW definitely needs to be doggedly ruled out. After that a Holter monitor or other personal event monitor should be carried by you to see how often A-fib occurs. Then, if it seems problematic, an eletrophysiologist should evaluate you  for possible RF ablation, after which you  would likely never have the problem again. (The RF ablation is an in and out procedure which at most might keep you in  the  hospital for one night,  usually allowing the  patient to go home the same day).   At your young age it is especially important that this not be blown off as a \"nothing.\" It's not at all normal, although a few rare individuals do have it for no apparent reason and  don't suffer any serious problems. There's just no reason to put up with the annoyance and risk when it is usually so easy to resolve. The beta blocker you've been given may or may not control the problem, but then  you're married to this medication infefinitely. There really is a better, simpler way in most cases.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello I have been to a cardiologist because I have had heart palpitations. The first time that I experienced this problem, I went to the ER, the doctors didn't find anything at all.  They diagnosed me with chest pains.  Then 2 days later, I was re-admitted to a hospital for Palpitations again.  This time, it felt like something was grabbing my heart.  I also had weakness and a radiating pain throughout my body.  They did an EKG, ECG, Chest X-ray, blood test, and urine test.  They didn't find anything either. I had normal cholesterol, normal everything.   So I went to a cardiologist who put me through a stress test, a nervous system test, a blood test, a urine test, EKG and another ECG.  This time, they found a problem.  I was diagnosed with a Supra Ventricular Tachycardia. The Doctor put me on Beta Blockers (propanolol 10mg). Now, this is over a period of 2 and a half weeks.  It has now been 3 and a half weeks and I still feel the same, but, now my heart is beating very weakly, My resting pulse before all of this usually was between 80 to 90 BPM, now it is about 54 to 65 BPM, my extremities get cold fast, the last time my blood pressure was read it was 90/60, my body temperature has been fluctuating between 97.0 degrees Fahrenheit and 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit.  I have been feeling dizzy, I have been having unusual dreams, I have had trouble concentrating, random muscle spasms, a traveling pain throughout my body from my head, to my neck to my left arm, my legs, my stomach, chest, and, back.  I told my cardiologist about all of this and he didn't say anything about it.  Most of this has been going on since before I took the beta blockers.  I am only 18 years old.  I have only been inactive for the past 4 months.  I was starting to gradually become more active in September only to have this happen to me. Do I have a possible blood clot somewhere in my body?  Should I get checked out again?  I am really worried about this.  May I please know what is happening to me?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: I have been diagnosed with a supra ventricular tachycardia",
    "content": "Hi there -  While beta blockers are one of the first-line medications to treat supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), they will cause every single one of the symtpoms you report (except that wandering pain you describe). Most of these will tend to resolve over a few weeks time, but not everyone tolerates the beta blocker side effects as well as others. For this reason there is at least one other very effective medication available (not a beta blocker) for SVT, and that is verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, although since it also will lower blood pressure, the potential remains for lightheadedness and other symptoms of lowered blood pressure.  Ultimately SVT is often cured completely by a minimally invasive procedure called radio frequency catheter ablation (RFA or RFCA), in which the patient is sedated, a catheter is inserted via a tiny incision in the groin and into the femoral artery, a catheter is threaded up into the upper part of the heart, and a fine wire capable of stimulating the tachycardia at its source, then destroying the culprit cells with radio frequencies. This is a highly effective and usually permanent cure for most cases of SVT, although there are occasional needs  for follow up and the rare failure to cure. It is something well worth discussing with your doctor, since it is a permanent fix for the  problem,  is an in-and-out procedure (if you get in early enough in the day), and usually eliminates the need for any medications with possibly annoying side effects.  No reason to suspect the presence of a clot anywhere.   The underlying problem is not dangerous in young, otherwise healthy patients, but can be temporarily disruptive or disabling and can sometimes break through even with medicinal treatment, which is why the  electrophysiolgical testing and ablation is the preferred route.  I hope  this answers your questions. Please feel free to follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

Ususally when these episodes of fast heartbeat occur they will last around an hour and then my heart will slow down to normal, but it still bothers me a lot because it's very unsettling and I get very dizzy and kind of nauseaus.   Also at random times my chest feels very tender and I will have brief sharp pains in the middle of my chest, and occasionally I have trouble breathing.  So I would like to know if all this is normal because it's never happened before, it has only been for the past month or two.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Fast Heart Beat Related To Caffiene, Alcohol, Pills",
    "content": "Hello -  While caffeine has a very clear cut and well-established realtionship to increased heart rate and palpitations/premature heartbeats/etc., it isn't as well known that even decaffeinated coffee still contains some caffeine, and some people are just sensitive enough to have some effects from it, although it is far less common that with regular coffee. Also, alcohol, in sensitive people, can cause the same symptoms and, in most people, will produce at least some increase in heart rate anyway. This is because alcohol causes a reflex dilation of blood vessels (causing that \"warm\" feeling that seems so pleasant as a rule, when having had a drink or two), and the more, up to a point, the greater the effect. When this happens, blood pressure drops due to the blood vessels' capacity being increased. As a result of this, the heart is programmed to respond by speeding up its rate to compensate for the drop in pressure. It's a subtle mechanism but the effect is pretty commonly reported. So yes, that's all normal. Trazadone (and other tricyclic drugs) are often responsible for increased heart rate as well.   Tenderness upon manual pressure on the chest, as well as \"brief, sharp pains\" in the chest are, together or separately, not symptoms of heart disease, but usually of either anxiety and/or inflammation of the cartilage where the ribs connect to the sternum. This is called costochondritis and usually responds to over-the-counter anti-inflammatories such as Advil or Aleve, as directed on the label.   What you've been experiencing is well within the range of normal,  given the provocations (alcohol, caffeine and even reduced caffeine). You sound like an otherwise very healthy 17 year old woman.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck to you, and please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Ectopic beats and flipped t waves",
    "content": "Hi,  I've had strange sensations in my chest for several years but having visited my GP recently when they became more frequent, I've been told that they are ectopic heartbeats. I'm happy with this and they don't worry me, but I recently learned that my grandmother, who died when I was very young, had a valve defect and died on the operating table from an unrelated arrythmia while she was having a valve replacement. This has got me a bit concerned that the ectopic beats may be related to something more sinister. I've had an ECG which I am awaiting the results of. I also had several traces done at University as I had recurrent episodes of waking up during the night with a heart rate >200bpm, they were all normal except for showing flipped t waves.   What I really want to know is whether I should be concerned about the ectopics and whether the ECG that I had will be sufficient to rule out any problems like those that my grandmother had.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Ectopic beats and flipped t waves",
    "content": "Hi there -  The  resting EKG should be able to reveal any truly ominous or troublesome causes of the ectopy,  which is almost never problematic anyway, even in most people with actual heart disease. These premature beats are perfectly normal, if alarming, and are almost never of any diagnostic or prognostic significance.   The problem your grandmother experienced was very likely one of those anesthesia-related events which, while rare, are more likely to happen in certain individuals who already have some sort of structural or electrical heart problem.   I would be slightly more concerned about the nocturnal epsisodes of tachycardia in excess of 200 beats per minute that you've experienced. While this likley is totally unrelated to your palpitations, it's not normal. It is not uncommon in otherwise healthy young people, but if it becomes persistent or frequent it can be disruptive and disturbing. When it occurs in conjunction with flipped T-waves it's usually associated with electrolyte depletion, specifically a lack of potassium. Fortunately, this sort of thing can be managed medically (medication to prevent the episodes or potassium supplements if that's the problem) or ablated entirely by minimally invasive catheter procedure. If this becomes an issue you certainly do have options. As far as the ectopic beats, we all have them and if we are aware of them we can try to reduce the factors that can  provoke them (such as caffeine, alcohol,  tobacco, stress, etc.), but there's always some of this  at some times. A lucky few are unaware of them. The rest of us just have to put up with the aggravation. Again, they are almost never significant for anything unless the subject already has serious, symptomatic heart disease.  I hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Frequent sensations of ectopic/skipped heartbeats",
    "content": "Hello there, my name is Dave and I am a 26 year old male. After witnessing a traumatic event in 2001 i started having panic attacks and generally just being very anxious about alot of things. This has steadily become worse over the course of 7 years and along with the mental strain, i have been suffering with physical symptoms aswell for many a year. Sometimes these symptoms are present when i am not even anxious so i am considering the possibility that years of relentless negative and stressful thoughts and long term affects of a heart being overworked during anxiety/panic attacks has caused damage to my heart.  As it regards my heart, it is hard to describe but it feels like it is enlarged or congested in some way. It is a scary sensation but it does feel like that. In addition i suffer with paused and skipped heartbeats very regularly with this occuring mostly after consuming food or a meal or after waking up. The heart can very regularly pause for 1-2 seconds and then start again beating normally for afew beats and then repeat the cycle. When the beats commence after a pause i experience what can only be described as a headrush sensation. Upon standing i also get frequent headrushes, even if i have only been seated for afew minutes.  With the aforementioned i also have trouble obtaining a proper breathe and sometimes concentrating on taking a deep breath results in a varying bradycardic and tachycardic heartbeat sensation occuring within inhalation and exhalation. It is not a gasping for air type of difficulty breathing but all the same, i can not gain a full deep breathe.  I don't know if this has any importance but for afew years now i also have a visible beating in my abdomen (seen clearest when laying on my back). These beats occur about an inch above my navel. I have had this now for at least 4 years. I am 5 foot 11 and 170lbs and some people say when you have a more slim build you will notice this more anyway. Anxiet sufferers are also said to have these pulsations.  I have not had any drastic change in weight at all. Now and again i will go up and down within afew days but there is no real change in weight. I have a home bp test kit and when i do check my bp i usually range between 120-135/72-90. My skipped heartbeat is see n on the display screen of the BP machine when i check my blood pressure.  Doctor, can you in any way advise me?? Should i be concerned? And is there anything i can do to aid myself re the arrythmias and palpitations?  Thankyou for taking the time to read and acknowledge my question.  Yours Sincerely  Dave S Birmingham UK\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Frequent sensations of ectopic/skipped heartbeats",
    "content": "Hello Dave -  First of all, let me say that I sympathize with you regarding the anxiety problem. Chronic anxiety punctuated by panic attacks is a very common manifestation of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is no doubt what has caused your lingering anxiety disorder. Although some people find this rather amazing, the problem usually does not resolve on its own over time, so it's not surprising that you continue to experience these symptoms.   The good news is that the problem will not, in itself, cause damage to the heart, even though many people also find this difficult to believe because of the way it makes them feel physically. The bad news, as you've learned, is that the heart learns a number of bad habits in reacting to the constant stress and higher levels of adrenaline in the bloodstream, and this makes it more difficult for the patient to differentiate between what is \"normal\" and what might actually warrant concern. Worse, it often makes it more difficult for clinical personnel to differentiate between the two also, and in some instances this results in the patient getting lumped into a subgroup of hypochondriacal patients,  which is absolutely wrong. Still, it often happens. As a result, the patient with panic disorder, PTSD or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) must become especially assertive with his healthcare providers if there are any unanswered questions.   Given all that you've described in your very well-worded  post, you draw a classic picture of chronic anxiety and panic disorder, with a secondary tendency (almost unavoidable) toward somatic sensitivity (an unhelpful awareness of ordinary and common bodily behaviors). For instance, while  you've mentioned having been told that anxious people often \"have\" the visible abdominal pulsation, in fact a great many people of all  sorts have this phenomenon, and if a really trained eye is applied, virtually everyone has it. Anxious people are simply far more likely to notice it, focus on  it, and wonder about it.   By the same token,  there are other arcane symptoms you describe which also capture the attention of the anxious patient and while these are almost always benign, there is that layer of symptomology that just might be masking something else.  It is an acquired art to learn when something rises above the daily,  anxiety-rooted symptom to the level of something potentially wrong, since even anxious people can  get sick. It's  just harder for them to know when  they are.   Again, everything you've described is classic for the  problem  from which you suffer. This doesn't mean  there couldn't,  at some time (most likely in the distant future) be something wrong which might otherwise cause some of these symptoms, but even so, most of them are so subjective that they really are  easily explained away.   What I would suggest, if you haven't explored it yet, is one or both of two approaches to managing (and possibly even curing) the underlying problem: first, the discipline of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a self-limited (that is, not never-ending) form of  psychotherapy wherein the patient is taught how to recognize the symptoms, triggers, and overall mechanism of the problem and how to short-circuit the process, abort panic attacks, relieve chronic anxiety, and begin to live free of the dark cloud hovering over everything. The other possible approach, usually also temporary, is pharmaceutical, in that there are a number of medications which can  be very effective in suppressing anxiety and preventing panic \"seizures.\" These drugs do not, however, fix the problem, so they are best used in conjunction with a comprehensive CBT program, so that the patient can get immediate as well as long-term relief.  All in all I'd say you are very likely in perfect physical health, but you do owe it to yourself to be certain when there are questions lingering, and for that purpose this website can  serve a unique purpose. Some of the symptoms you experience would  happen anyway in a \"normal\" person (such as the premature heartbeats,  which we all have from time to time anyway, and which are of no diagnostic nor prognostic value anyway). The goal is to reduce the frequency of these symptoms and, moreso, to reduce your awareness of and concern for them.   I hope this is helpful to you. This is not  a simple problem, as I'm  sure you know, but increased awareness of and sympathy for sufferers of this sort of problem have led to a huge opening up of the field in terms  of management,  treatment and even sometimes complete cure. If you have any further questions please don't hesitate to follow up with us here. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thankyou Doctor for a very in depth and helpful response to my original post. For you to take the time to send such a detailed reply is sincerely appreciated!  If i may have a little more of your time however Doctor, alot of my negative worry has alot to do with specific scenarios and situations, most likely born of the panic and anxiety issues i have suffered. I have the physical symptoms i mentioned in my first message on this forum and my main worries that occupy most of my day are fainting in a public place (as this was my initial trigger back in 2001), being a victim of sudden death (hence my heart questions in the initial message about heart enlargement, skipped and paused heartbeats, congestive sensation in heart etc) Another factor that bolsters my negative worries are the fact that alot of these cases occur in young people (usually between mid teens to late 30s) and this fear doesn't help matters whatsoever.  I know very frequently an anxiety sufferer can be their own worst enemy for escalating fears and thus feeling physical symptoms but i also have been told and have heard on many an occasion that if you have physical symptoms your body is trying to tell you something.  Doctor is there anything you know that could allay my concerns regarding those things mentioned in the second paragraph please?  Also if i may, is a normal/safe blood pressure reading indicative of a healthy heart or is there no way a home kit can give clarity to the health of the heart??  Thankyou again Doctor for your time. I have a job interview tomorrow and so i have nerves about that and its at times like this the additional strain isn't warranted.  Yours Sincerely,  Dave S Birmingham UK\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again -  You're very welcome. We do what we can.  To respond to your specific concerns, you've posited the classic intellectual/existential basis for much anxiety and even depression. What sometimes sets the stage is intellectual doubt and questioning about the very nature and tenuousness of existence, bolstered by some incomplete medical information we've picked up along the way, and what \"could\" happen. If one is already wired to be inclined to experience more than the usual anxiety and perhaps panic attacks, this line of thinking will almost certainly help tip the balance in favor of dread and anticipation of events which are either out of the question or are statistically unlikely (and often even improbable). The fact that we hear about things that may have happened to others with whom we can relate really isn't helpful, and many people are skillful at tuning out this essentially useless information. Others, for various reasons, tend to go the opposite way and lock into them, matching them up with the subjective physical symptoms they feel and finding it difficult to disconnect the two. This is my aim: to try and help you understand why your concerns are unwarranted. Here we go:  Over the past six years you've entertained a fear of fainting in a public place. Has that ever, in those six years, ever actually happened? Apparently not, or you'd have mentioned that in your history. You've probably felt as though you would, ,but you haven't. The longer you go without having this happen, the less likely it is that you ever will, but the more likely you will anticipate it over and over again as \"possible.\" Well yes, it is possible, as sometimes, for various (usually innocent) reasons, people sometimes do pass out. But more often than not they don't. That's the fact of the matter. That you haven't, even though you've feared you might based on symptoms not well understood by you, should be helpful in bringing you to the realization that while passing out in public would probably be inconvenient, embarrassing, etc., it's apparently not going to happpen, even when you feel it \"should\" happen. We latch onto the worst case and dread that. Same thing with sudden death. This is actually a pretty rare event among otherwise healthy individuals. Once we've done some pretty simple and straightforward tests (such as a resting EKG) we can pretty much rule out any chance that a person has one of the extremely rare conditions that can cause such an outrageous event. If your Q-T interval on EKG is normal then you're almost certainly not ever going to just spontaneously fall over dead. It's really as simple as that. The fact that many young athletes suffer from overdeveloped left ventricles or have electrical abnormalities in their hearts is overemphasized simply because it is so very unusual. That's why when it does happen we hear about it. If it were truly common it wouldn't be news. But it is not common, and again, it is very easily ruled out, usually by a simple EKG and sometimes also an echocardiogram. Every young athlete should be screened for these disorders, since if one in a million  turns up with a potential problem (even though there is almost always a family history to suggest it anyway), then there's a life that can be saved. Otherwise it usually shows up in a routine physical. Anxious people actually have an advantage in this area, as they have eventually had pretty exhaustive cardiovascular workups which show there is nothing of the sort present. These are not conditions one can just suddenly acquire. They are almost always inherited. If you don't have one of them, you're not going to develop one later. If that were truly possible, no one could function without undue anxiety and dread. That many of us don't realize this leaves many crippled by their anxiety and anticipation of catastrophes that are almost impossible. It is easy to tell you this; it is not as easy for you to embrace it as truth and break the habit of reacting to your own thoughts and fears, which many times originate due to some other, more obscure psychological basis. Being prone to weird, scary symptoms doesn't help. However, understanding that almost everyone has the sensations from time to time can be helpful. Knowing that premature heartbeats, odd chest sensations, and even the occasional lightheadedness, can help put things into a more positive context. This is why cognitive behavioral therapy is often so wonderfully helpful, since it teaches the anxious patient how to recognize when he is headed into that psychological \"house of mirrors\" where he allows himself to become unhealthily aware of little things his body is doing that are basically normal. One concentrates, then, more on the apparent unhealthiness rather than the  overall good health. The trick is to reverse this tendency, as we do need to be able to recognize when we have an actual problem, and anxiety just makes it very difficult to tell the difference. It makes life a lot less pleasurable when we're always feeling our pulse or waiting for that Sword of Damocles to fall on us.   Regarding blood pressure, in someone with a known heart problem (which you do not have) it is useful to check the blood pressure on an infrequent but regular basis. Also, if there is any remarkably different symptom taking place (such as lightheadedness, throbbing in the  head, etc.), it may be useful to check, but a normal blood pressure (or a just slightly high or low one) tells us very little other than that the subject doesn't have the risk factor of high blood pressure. So checking it frequently without a concrete reason only causes more anxiety, since it can vary greatly during the day, from moment to moment, depending on one's activity or lack of it, and one's state of mind at any given moment. Not an extremely useful exercise, all in all. Another word about blood pressure: if you're feeling fine, it doesn't matter how low a figure you may read; if it's working fine for you, then it's fine. If it's not working for you, you'll already have passed out or at least sat down. If it's too high, a routine physical should uncover this and you'd then be put on medication to manage that. Again, although sometimes the numbers seem disturbingly low, if one is up and around and fine, then that is only something to make a casual mental note of, and perhaps check it again later to compare. Again, as long as it's working for you, it doesn't much matter what the reading is (and the equipment, especially home-use equipment, can be fooled and give erroneous readings).   There is the whole issue, also, of hyperventilation, which would take an entire additional post, but involves the sensation of not getting enough air when clearly everything is working correctly. This often causes lightheadedness and can even cause fainting, can also cause numbness and tingling around the mouth and in the hands, and can be very frightening. It's a product of faulty breathing, usually set off by (unconscious) deep sighing, which throws off the CO2 balance and tricks the  brain and body into thinking it needs more air. It becomes a cycle which can be terrifying, but actually corrects itself or can be corrected by rebreathing into a simple paper bag to restore CO2 balance.  I hope all this  is helpful. Please follow up as needed. It can sometimes take a while to properly address all the underlying questions. That's why we're here. Best of luck to you. Do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 52-year-old woman, perimenopausal, with heart flutterings that I've been experiencing since the birth of my youngest daughter 13 years ago.  At the time, I thought it might be related to hormones, since I'd never experienced this until just after the delivery.  However, my PCP didn't seem to take it too seriously, and told me flutterings or feeling as if my heart was \"skipping a beat\" was \"common\" and not to worry.  Well, this fluttering has never gone away, and I regularly experience it several times a day, almost everyday, even at rest.  I am currently on estradiol and progesterone replacement therapy, so if this issue was related to estrogen drop, it doesn't seem to be alleviated by the estrogen I am taking.  Although, I should note that my blood values on estrogen are still not in the optimal range that I'm seeking.  Please, can you tell me what might be some causes for sudden onset of fluttering heartbeat, and are there any tests I should be asking my current doctor for?  Most have just shrugged it off over the years, and never really addressed it.  I KNOW there must be some cause, and I'd like to know what it is and what I can do about it...or if I should be worried that this could develop into some sort of life-threatening arrhythemia.

    "title": "Re: Heart fluttering",
    "content": "Hello -  The good news is your doctor is correct, that these palpitations  (usually premature ventricular contractions -- PVCs) are common. The bad news is that is so often the case, he didn't go into much detail about them, so you're left to wonder if something serious has been missed. So here's the deal with that: PVCs (and also premature atrial contractions or PACs, and a number of other less \"popular\" arrhythmias) are all not only common, but also harmless and of no particular diagnostic nor prognostic significance. They happen in almost everyone at some time or another. Some people  develop them during some stressful event after never having had them before (or at  least never having noticed them), and then they seem to be more frequent forever. Pregnancy is a very common reason for them to become noticeable and maybe more frequent as well, and once we start to notice these we rarely stop, but sometimes we do get used to them and they tend to become more like \"background noise.\"  People who have mitral valve prolapse (MVP -- more common in women than  in  men and extremely common in the general population) usually have a greater frequency of these \"fluttering\" sensations, and again, usually some stressor or traumatic event (and pregnancy can be both) often start them up.   To put perhaps too fine a point on the prosaic nature of PVCs, some  people  have as their regular rhythm something called ventricular begeminy, in which every other beat is a PVC, and which, if it occurs in someone only occasionally, can be quite alarming, but usually in those who have it all the time they are totally unaware of it. Also, PVCs are more likely to occur when we are sitting quietly than when physically active (although in some people it is just the opposite), and also occur commonly after a meal (the same nerve which sets these off is also the one which controls digestive tract activity,  so there's no getting away from  it there), and are often felt when trying to fall asleep, especially when lying on one's left side. Caffeine and nicotine can send the heart fluttering, and hormonal changes (as with pregnancy, menopause and other such channges) can cause an increase in their frequency. In other words, just about any thing you can think of might cause them. Then again, very often there is no obvious cause. They are still benign. Twenty years or so ago they were considered to be a concern but during that time it's been realized they actually are quite normal, common and of no significance. People who aren't aware of them are very fortunate, but most of us feel them to some degree, and they are one of the most common  causes of acute anxiety and visits to the emergency room. It is this very commonness and innocuousness that makes them such a problem because,  as with your doctor, they are usually blown off without much of an explanation,  leaving the patient feeling not heard. This is extremely unfortunate, because this is one of the most common questions raised here.   I hope this has served to ease your mind somewhat, and we really are here to answer questions and explain things, so if you have any further questions, please feel free to follow up here.

    "content": "John,  Wow!  Thank you for the AWESOME reply to my concern about heart fluttering.  I really appreciate all the information!  If any doctor had ever given me even half that amount of information when I'd asked, my mind would've been put at ease years ago.   Likewise, I could really relate to a number of the factors you mentioned as being catalysts for an increase in this seemingly random fluttering.  So, at least I know that I'm not imagining that there are certain times when it seems to get more frequent or noticeable.   By the way, now I'm wondering just what distinguishes PVCs, PACs, and MVP from true arrhythemias?  Thanks again for your time and all the great info!\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome. I'm happy that it made sense and helped clarify things some. I suspect that between the fact that most doctors now understand the irrelevance of the most common arrhythmias such as PVCs, and the relentless time factor involved in moving patients in and out of the office, this is just too time consuming for a lot of them. Still, it could save a lot of office visits and worry if they'd take the time to say it just once.   It's helpful, too, that you are able to recognize some of the aggravating factors and correlate them with increased awareness of these episodes.   A quick answer to your question about what differentiates premature beats of one sort from another and from \"true\" arrhythmias (something I basically feel the same way about, although these are all usually lumped together as arrhythmias) would be that the difference is in the locus, the origin of the errant impulse. PVCs arise in the ventricles, which are the lower, larger chambers of the heart, so they really seem to have a life of their own. Premature atrial contractions arise in the upper chambers (atria) so often feel less forceful but more \"fluttery\", and can sometimes (given the right conditions) trigger an episode of rapid heartbeat, but this is also usually easier to manage than a ventricular arrhythmia (often referred to as a tachyarrhythmia, meaning fast and irregular or, more precisely, wrong). Ventricular tacharrhythmias, almost always associated with some more serious underlying disease or disorder, are more problematic, but rarely occur in otherwise healthy hearts, so they are over in another class all by themselves.   MVP is not an arrhythmia because it isn't a rhythm but rather an often slight abnormality of the leaflets of the mitral valve, in which one or both leaflets are just a tad larger than nature intended, and so close, sometimes, a little bit sloppily (\"floppy\" is a word commonly used). This almost never has any practical, useful meaning, but it is a finding, and so it's recorded. It also just happens, for reasons yet to be understood, that people with this abnormality often also have more frequent premature beats of all sorts, as well as occasional atrial arrhythmias, usually only momentary, which can feel like a sudden flutter or rush. These same people are, for equally inexplicable reasons, also more prone to anxiety problems, panic disorder and migraines. It's an intriguing mystery, and not everyone who has MVP has this syndrome, or even any noticeable symptoms. Many do, though. They also usually have, at least part of the time, a distinctive murmur, called a \"click\" murmur, which also means nothing, but is usually considered a diagnostic sign for MVP, even though at the next exam it may not be heard. MVP is generally considered by most doctors, now, to be a \"variation of normal\", but people with MVP syndrome somtimes do require extra attention because of the weird, disturbing, and often seemingly unrelated symptoms they sometimes have (which is precisely what a \"syndrome\" is: a collection of symptoms that is recognizable).   The more you understand about these things the easier it is to react to them in a calm manner, which can only mean less disruption of one's enjoyment of life. That's why I tend to spend as much time as necessary explaining it. I know what a difference it can make.   There are other \"true\" arrhythmias that can arise, for other reasons, and they are generally manageable and most of them are more annoying than anything else, but we all get the \"skips\" once in a while.   Thanks for the followup and the kind words. It makes it all worthwhile. I'm glad I was able to help.\n\n",

    "content": "I, too, am greatly appreciative of your very detailed explanation of such an uncomfortable condition!  When I read the post from VickiL56 it basically mirrored what I have been going through for the past 10 years.  I originally went to the ER, wore a Holter monitor for 24 hours, was sent to a cardiologist for a stress test and not one of the doctors, either in the ER, my regular primary care physician, nor the cardiologist told me anything about what I was having.  I was just told by the cardiologist that I had MVP and that was it!  If I have caffeine or MSG the racing heart, heart palpitations and awful panicky feeling in the pit of my stomach start up. Over the years these have gotten worse if I especially accidentally eat food with MSG--it's much easier to stay away from foods with caffeine. I have a post in the Rheumatology section I would appreciate your consideration of an answer to my question. After the initial answer I got (which scared me at first) I added a reply, but did not get any other answer to my question.  It is entitled \"strange back cramp\". Again, thank you so much for your wonderful descriptive answer to this puzzlement of many years for me (and I'm sure many others)!! Sincerely, Almost51\n\n",

I've also noted that many people with the associated syndrome are also very sensitive to MSG, something no one has been able to elucidate clearly as yet so far as I'm aware; it is, however, sufficiently well-documented and I'm glad you've mentioned it here, as it can often be a hidden trigger (especially since MSG itself is so often hidden in foods). A very useful and helpful addition to this thread.   I'll be checking on your other post regarding \"strange back cramp\" in a bit, and will follow up accordingly.\n\n",

    "content": "I am stuck with this horrible dry cough that is persistent and rarely goes away after having a breathing tube down my throat after just having RF ablation for the 2nd time.  I first had a RF ablation in July 2008, and it fixed my atrial flutter, but not the a-fib. So I went back in october 1 and had another one and this fixed my afib. However, this time due to the side of my heart they were zapping, they put a tube down my throat. 3 days after I came out of surgery/procedure (2nd ablation) I had this horrible crackling/wheezing sound in my chest. Well, I had pneumonia in January this year 2008, so I know what pneumonia is like - so I thought it was coming back. Went to the hospital, they said it wasn't pneumonia, and they just gave me an antibiotic. Well, it appeared to work for 4 days as the crackling/wheexing stopped but here we go. Now I hav this god-awful/horrible i want to die 'dry cough' that just doesnt seem to let up. So I go to my PCP a week later thinking it was reminents of the \"fake pneumonia\" I have earlier. She listens to my chest and says she cant hear the wheezing. So I breath out harder then she hears it. I never had asthma a day in my life. What does she say? \"you have asthma\" this is complete BS. I may be a diabetis, and a heart patient, but darn, my lungs are the one thing i don't have a problem with! LOL Anyay, she gives me advar and singular. the advar appeared to work for the first 3 days, and now it doesnt do a darn thing for me. I have a followup appt with my e.p. for the ablation on the 20th nov this month. Help me here will ya? I never had a problem with my lungs until that stupid breathing tube went down my throat. Now don't laugh at me, but I have always had a bit of oh I don't know call it, esp, being able to predict things - im no fortune teller but my sense of bad things (never good) happening well, i'm usually right about 90% of the time. I had a good feeling about going in for the first rf ablation, but not the 2nd. And I knew that it had something to do with the tube, I didnt know what. I even asked the e.p. 2 times before the surgery (one on the phone one the day of procedure) if he didnt have to use the tube and he said NO. Nothing to be afraid of. Well, apparantly I was right on - again.  A. What could of this tube done to me? B. Is it permanent?  Thank you for reading this and hope you can give me some advice, because my PCP is a clueless walking zombie with the heart of a rock, and my e.p. will not talk to me about this over the phone nor his nurse practitioner, only on the day of my followup visit and I have a hard time sleeping because of this A. keeping me awake B. my chest hurts from coughing and C. I'm tired of coughing every 2-10 minutes.  Thanks for answering this - just in case you do.  S.L.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Boy, this post-intubation cough thing can really be a bear! It doesn't happen real often, but often enough that we hear about it from time to time (sometimes combined with annoying hoarseness). There are a number of possible secondary causes, and the good news is it almost always resolves on its own, but it can be so crazy-making that it's not unreasonable to want some sort of symptomatic relief in the meantime.   If it can be ascertained that you don't have asthma nor is there any lower respiratory infection (and even though you've been told you have asthma, which of course would probably be spasm secondary to the intubation anyway), there are cough-suppressant medications that can be given, along with an expectorant (like the active ingredient in Mucinex) to reduce the coughing. A cough can be a wonderful device for clearing the airway of unwanted stuff, but when it's just due to irritation from something having been down there (the tube) it becomes a useless function that can be exhausting.   It would be great if you could have a consult with the doctor who actually did the intubation, and that mostly likely was not the EP (probably an anesthesiologist or pulmonologist on call that day), or someone else familiar with this really annoying syndrome. Even so, your GP, who really doesn't seem too interested, would normally be able to figure this out and handle it. Since he's apparently done all he's going to do (to very little effect), I would try for a referral for a consult with either a pulmonologist or ENT specialist, either of which should be familiar with this well-recognized problem and be able to put together a simple treatment plan to get you some short-term relief that would allow the airway to relax (the coughing, which you obviously cannot help) only serves to perpetuate the irritation that causes the cough, a sort of vicious cycle that needs to be broken. It's pretty clear the methods that have been tried haven't worked, and a more direct, medication-based cough suppression should probably be tried. You might have to be seen occasionally during this to be certain there's no stuff collecting in the bronchi or lungs during the time you're on such a medication, but you'd probably have some symptoms to tip you off if that were to happen anyway.  I hope this is helpful to you. I can certainly sympathize with your frustration at this point. It's great to have everything else fixed at last, but now something like this must just seem ridiculous. Please keep us updated, and see if you can get a specialist to take a shot at this. It really shouldn't be this complicated!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  When  a patient presents with palpitations that wind up being premature heartbeats such as you were having -- and which most people have at times, some more than others,  depending on the circumstances -- it is often  more of a problem for the doctor than the patient. While I commend your ability to look past this generally normal, if annoying, phenomenon, it may be that the cardiologist coincidentally saw something on your EKG which he felt warranted the stress test. If so you ought to have been told, and frequent premature beats in themselves are not generally considered a reason to persue further testing, but some doctors are more bothered by this -- and still believe the old school idea that frequent premature ventricular contractions have some potential significance, even though it's been determined over the past 20 years that they do not, even while they are happening.   It strikes me as a little odd that blood tests were done first to rule out causes of PVCs and then an EKG was done which showed they were, in fact, taking place. This,  if it actually happened in this order, is backwards.   All that being said, I would go with the stress test or  at least the echocardiogram. The latter does make sense, in that it could rule out (or in) some structural abnormality, usually a totally benign one such as mitral valve prolapse (MVP) which can cause some people to have more frequent (and so more annoying) \"spells\" of PVCs. While this is generally \"useless\" information, it  can be very reassuring to the patient (or, sometimes,  the doctor),  as it is almost always a benign and  convenient explanation for episodes of palpitations such as you experienced (and I take it this has only happened the one time).   If  the echocardiogram shows nothing, and if there is no family history of premature heart  disease (meaning close relatives with heart disease prior to age 60) then the stress test would seem unimportant, but it also couldn't hurt anything.   If the cardiologist did see something he felt was a potential problem, it  would help rule this out and clear  the air. A patient really ought to be apprised of what's going on, but some doctors have their  own peculiar ways of working through these things.   I strongly suspect the tests will show nothing, but  either way it's a win-win, as negative results would be welcome and if something were found, it could then be followed and managed as needed, even though, again,  this seems like a very unlikely outcome.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needes.\n\n",

    "content": "I agree with the doc on this one. Listen, Im now 24 y/o. I've had an arrhythmia since 2000 when I was 26. Who knows how it was brought on... heredity, workout pills when I was in my teens that had ephedrine ine it or whatever. Point it is I started with just atrial flutter and atenolol helped. I eventually was diagnosed with afib on top of the flutter and had my E.P tell me that I was the word case he ever seen.   So they put me on flecanide and metoporol, and that worked for a while - then wuit. I had it. I got tired of feeling wore out, my hair and nails appeared to not be growing at all anymore, literally had no color to me. I had black and hispanic guys I worked with joke with me saying 'what happened to you, you are whiter than Casper. Man you need some sun.\" And I didn't realize it, but it was true. Saw my mother for the first time in a while and she said something along the lines of \"I need some sun.\" The flutter and fib were constant and never went away. My body just rejected the flecanide and metoporol cause they got used to it. So I opted for rf ablation. I've had 2 zaps now, and feel wonderful. I need one more and am hoping to get it done before the end of the year so I don't have to pay another deductible.   Don't mess around, if you want a permanent fix if your problem persists, definitely get rf ablation or cryoblation. There are bests and worsts of both. RF ablation has a higher success rate of not returning but has a wider uncontrolled area of zapping, where as cryoblation is more precise in the area its targeting to ablate and getting the bad area - but has a lower percentage as far as arrhythmia returning later. If your a doctor, I believe I stated that pretty accurate, but feel free to correct me if I am wrong in describing what I just mentioned.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Digoxyn isn't the ideal drug for SVT, but it can be effective in many instances. A beta blocker would be preferable, or, especially, a calcium channel blocker such as verapamil, which is the usual drug of first choice for most types of SVT. However, Digoxyn is a reasonable stopgap drug for this purpose, at least so long as there aren't any truly annoying side effects.   Increasing magnesium intake is believed to sometimes also be beneficial in  controlling at least some forms of SVT, and if taken according to directions is unlikely to do any harm and may help.  Hopefully you'll be able to afford a more appropriate drug soon (acquiring insurance). In the meantime Digoxyn, so long as it works for you and can be tolerated, is certainly an acceptable alternative.   I hope this answers your question. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am 36 years old and have suffered from anxiety and panic attacks for about 10 years so I am use to feeling an occasional irregular heart beat. Another problem I have suffered from for a little over 2 years now is constant diareah (sorry for that information but it might have something to do with my heart). I thought it was from having anxiety because that was about the time I went back to college for nursing. Well, about 11 months ago my doctor sent me to the hospital and they told me I had crohns disease (even though the only symtom was the diareah that I suffer from). Anyway, The doctor is not sure of that anymore and just took some blood work for absorption in my small bowel. Sorrry, i just wanted to give a little history before I got to my question.   I have been feeling abnormal heart beats for months now and I have been under so much stress that I had to leave school. My primary doctor sent me to get a 24 hr Holter Monitor put on and I just went to pick up the results yesturday and brought them to my doctor who didnt tell me anything but referred me to a cardiologist. Here is what the results said:       The average heart rate was 84, with a minimum of 47 and a maximum of 145.  Ventricular ectopic beats totaled 7979, with 6 VE pairs and 0 V-Runs.  Supraventricular ectopics totaled 59, with 9 SV-Runs.  Pauses in excess of 2.5 seconds totaled 0.  The number of minutes of analyzed ECG data was 1396.      ST episode minutes totaled 2.  The maximum Delta ST of -1.1 mm occurred at 20:04.  Thats the end of the report and I am so scard. Can someone PLEASE tell me what this means and what I should expect. Do you think this is something very serious?  I was also wondering if this could me from all the loose bowel movements I have been suffering from for the last couple of years combined with having anxiety on a daily basis. Thank you any information you can give me.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Please help, 24h Holter Monitor results and scared",
    "content": "Hi there -  We need to address two separate issues I think: first, the meaning (if any) of your Holter monitor results, and second, why you've had all this ectopic activity.   First, the test results are fine. In an otherwise healthy (GI problems aside) young person, this number of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) is not nearly as great as it can be in some subjects, although it probably seems (and felt) like an awful lot. Broken down into  per-minute average, it comes to about 5.5 per minute, just enough to be really annoying. However, nothing malignant (scary) showed up. You did, also, have 59 supraventricular beats (usually called premature atrial complexes or PACs), with 9 supraventricular runs (very brief bursts of rapid heartbeat originating up in the atria). While this can feel very disturbing as well, so long as it isn't of concern medically, and even if it were to become sustained, it's almost never truly serious, but more of a major annoyance. That didn't happen.   This is all consistent with the probable causes of what was recorded and you've been feeling. Situational stress, chronic anxiety and, yes, GI upsets, can all contribute to both PVCs and PACs. While we all have some of these once in a while, some have more than others (and believe it or not, some have many more than your test showed up). At other times you may have few to none, but when it's not happening we rarely think about them, except perhaps to anticipate that they might start up again. This causes more anxiety and stress,which releases more adrenaline, which is handy when needed, but otherwise just makes us jumpy and irritates the heart muscle, which reacts by throwing off these premature beats.   The cause of the bouts of diarrhea, whatever it may turn out to be, still has to be in part caused by stimulation of the vagus nerve, which will usually cause premature beats in otherwise healthy people. Just digesting  a meal will often cause them (a lot of people complain of this). Eating, digesting, GI upset, drowsing off, laying down to sleep,  fatigue, sleep deprivation, caffeine, nicotine, gas (GI again), anxiety, panic attics (in particular), certain medications, and on and on and on -- these all can trigger the really annoying and sometimes unnerving premature beats, but even though they may be relatively frequent, if there is nothing seriously wrong with the heart (usually with the left ventricle specifically), then they actually mean  little-to-nothing diagnostically. It does help to know they're happening, as the discomfort can be explained. Unfortunately it rarely is, at least sufficiently.   As far as the palpitations go, what you can expect is that they will come and go, sometimes act up for long periods, then for no obvious reason will go away for a while. It's normal. Some people actually have a PVC as every other beat, which would mean, given an average heart rate of only 60 beats per minute, somewhere around 43000 PVCs in 24 hours,  with nothing serious going on. Hard to believe, but it happens. Since some of these people don't  feel them at all (for whatever lucky reason), they are surprised to find out they're even having them. Others feel every single misfire. This can produce terrible anxiety  -- and, ironically, it can be caused  by anxiety as well.  Your doctor, after reviewing the report, and considering your problem with PD and  generalized anxiety (GAD), may well prescribe something to reduce the frequency of the premature beats, but only to give you a little break  and some peace of mind. It's preferable to not treat them in general, but for those who are seriously troubled by associated anxiety will often be prescribed a beta blocking drug which slows the heart rate and reduces the threshold for PVCs, PACs, etc., and  this often helps reduce the anxiety. You may also be offered (if you don't already take one), something to address the anxiety and panic attacks directly. In some cases this is a good approach and can really be a life-changer for some people.  In  short, managing your anxiety ranks right up there with diagnosing what's going on with your GI tract.  Either or both may lead to relief or reduction of the frequency of palpitations, which are actually not a medical concern. The other things are, and once they're resolved, it's very likely you'll feel a whole lot better. If the doctor chooses to treat the palpitations  and/or anxiety medically together, that's fine too. Something else to consider (assuming you haven't already tried it) is cognitive behavioral therapy, a self-limited form of psychotherapy which is interactive and helps the patient learn how to manage stress, anxiety and even some  physical symptoms. It works for a lot of people to some degree.  I hope this helps ease your mind. Your heart appears to be fine, just in a cranky mood. This sort of symptom is almost never a true problem and yours is no exception. It does take time for this to sink in sometimes, though,  once it's been explained. Get that stomach issue figured out. That's medically a lot more important.   Best of luck to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank You so Much for replying so fast and all the information. I have to go to the cardiologist today at 2:00 and I will definatly let you know what they tell me. I do go to counceling for the anxiety and panic attacks. I have been going for a very long time now and learned about cognitive behavioral theropy (it's just a little hard  when you have 5 kids running around). I have also tried a lot of different medications to help with the anxiety (SSRI and others) but my body is so sensitive to medication they had to keep taking me off of them. They basically just have me on xanax 1mg. 2-3 times a day. I only take it in the morning and at night right before I go to sleep unless I start having a severe panic attack which actually has been under controll compared to years ago when I couldn't even leave the house (then I will take that 3rd one but I really try not to). I have been on xanax for so many years now and I do know that it is very addictive and thats why I will only let myself take the 2 I mentioned.   I am more worried about the diarrhea now because I do feel that it is causing the heart problems. I will see the doctor next week regarding that because she ran a blood test and I'm going back for the results. You have really put my mind at ease regarding my heart and I thank you so much for that, you have a graet day and I will write back after seing the cadiologist.  Thank you So very Much\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the follow-up and we'll be looking for the update as well.   Regarding the anxiety problem, you've done a lot of work toward managing that, and it can be really difficult sometimes. Medication can play a role for sure, but SSRIs often have the unfortunate result of increasing agitation and anxiety in certain people, so they don't always work. While Xanax is a great \"rescue\" drug (for aborting a panic attack), it's not long-acting, so you're very wise to use it as you have so far. Another, related medication, clonazepam (brand name Klonopin) sometimes works far better as a maintainance medication and can make the Xanax a fall-back in case of symptom breakthrough. It would be worth discussing this with your doctor unless it's already been tried and found not to work for you. Most people who respond well to Xanax do very well with clonazepam. Just a thought.  I'll be watching for your next post. Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Well, I just saw the cadiologist yesturday and he put me through a bunch of test. When I first arrived the nurse brought me in to do a EKG (which she did twice after seeing so many palpatations the first time). She brought the results to the doctor and he came in the room and spoke with me about my family history and some other stuff. He listened to my heart and at that point he decided to have a sonogram done on my heart and sent me into another room. The person doing the sono let the doctor know that I did have a small heart murmur (but nothing for me to worry about). I heard them say something about MVP's (I hope that is right or is it MPV?) but again, nothing that was a big concern. He basically told me everything you explained to me about the PVC's and PAC's (hope i am putting the right initials). They decided it was safe enough for me to do the srtess test and I was so scared I would die but I trusted the doctor. Well, I did great on the stress test from what the doctor said. Actually, the palpitations stopped when I started getting a work out. My blood presure first started off at 130/100 then when the machine speeded up it went up to 160/100, but the strange thing is when we went to the next level and it went faster it was 168/90. The doctor told me all the palpitations stopped which I knew because i didn't feel them at all anymore (plus I know when my heart speeds up when I'm having an anxiety attack at home they always stop). He told me that a little exercising (even if its just taking long walks each day) will help me a lot. He definatly said my doctor had to find out what going on as far as the diarrhea beause that can put a strain on the heart with the amount that I go. (In Jan. 2008 I weighed 152 and yesturday I was 126 lbs.). I know that might sound good to some people but I am losing weight in a very unhealthy way and I keep losing weight each week, last week at the doctors office I was 132 and the week before I was 136. So basically, I need to start walking each day to get some excercise and I don't have to see him again for 1 year regading the small heart murmur that I never knew about so they can just follow up and make sure everything is o,k,. Of course he told me that if I felt anything that was bothering me I could see him before that. He also told me when i first came in and he saw the results from the Holter Monitor and then the 2 EKG's they did he was going to put me on Beta Blokers but he feels I don't have to take them now after doing the stress test which was such good news to me because I am so scared to take medication.  I would like to Thank You So very much because when you explained everything to me before seeing the doctor it made me less anxious when I went to the cadiologist and I already knew everything he was explaining to me because you already broke everything down to me in a way that I could understand so when he was telling me the same thing you explained I already understood. You are doing a GREAT job on here explaining things to everyone and i hope I am speaking for everyone when I say that \"We really appreciate You\".   Thank You So Very Much, Mia\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mia,  I'm so glad you had such a positive experience with the cardiologist! It's always really reasurring to be able to see the evidence that everything's OK even when it seems something must be wrong. Oh, and you got the initials of the premature beats right. :)  In most people exercise will reduce of eliminate PVCs, especially if they occur at rest. In a few people it works the opposite way (they come on with exertion and seem to go away at rest), so this has become part of the conventional wisdom, and you got to see just how that works with the stress test. Also, during a stress test we like to see the blood pressure go up just as yours did. Not through the roof, but appropriate to the amount of stress being placed on the heart by the test (which is exactly why it's called a \"stress\" test). You did great!   I'm glad you won't be having to take a beta blocker, mainly because of your aversion to medication. And you can still know that's there as a fallback plan if the palpitations ever really start driving you crazy.  You're  very welcome by the way, and thank you for bringing your concerns to the site here. We all do our very best to help clarify and reassure. I'm very happy things turned out as they did. (You're right about the weight loss, too, and the GI issue can now be addressed with less anxiety, which may actually help that part).  Best of luck to you. Don't hesitate to bring any further questions to us.\n\n",

I will often lay down and listen to my heart with a heart monitor...this has a soothing affect on me and helps me relax believe it or not...But i noticed that when i swallow my heart rate seems to accelerate for about a millisecond then goes back to normal. It unnerved me a bit and wanted to know if this was common for a heart rate to do that. Is it normal for one's heart rate to be affected by swallowing?  Also, after eating, is it normal for your BPM to go up? or should it stay at its regular pace?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Heart rate affects from swallowing",
    "content": "Hello -  Because there are both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves lying in the neck/throat, swallowing, as well as the passive act of digestion, can either slow or increase the heart rate. While usually it is the vagus nerve (the \"brake\", which slows the heart rate), which is stimulated, in some people the opposite can occur as well. Neither is abnormal nor abnormal for any give individual, although the slight speeding up usually draws less attention, since it tends to suppress the premature beats that often happen when the heart slows instead.   In  short, a normal finding.\n\n",

    "content": "When I was younger I passed out several times in situations like a scary movie, sight of too much blood, excessive worry, etc. I wouldnt pass out quickly, rather I knew it was coming and could recognize it was happening and lay down before fully blacking out.  I wore a halter monitor for a while, but the doctors never found anything. They suspected some sort of over-reaction to adrenaline but I didnt really understand what they meant at the time.  Last week, I broke my nose. The shock from it was much worse than the actual injury, as my heart rate slowed to about 20 bpm, and was barely noticeable my pulse at the wrist and neck. I was barely able to remain conscious, and couldnt stand without coming to the brink of passing out. After about 10-15 minutes my heart rate went back to normal.  Im having surgery on my nose tomorrow where I'll have to be put under for about 30 minutes. I have two questions.   1. Does anyone know what might be causing this massive reactionary slowdown? I would expect my heart to race in such situations like breaking a bone, etc., but its doing the exact opposite. 2. I realize I cant take this as official consult, but what is your hunch on the anesthesia? In your opinion, would it be ok for someone with the described conditions to go under?  Thanks in advance!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Instant heart slowing",
    "content": "Hello -  Very good questions! What you describe sounds like classic vasovagal reflex, which means your autonomic nervous system (parasympathetic side) works a little too well. In people with this problem, which is in itself benign (except for the potential to strike one's head when falling due to a faint), it can be disabling at times, and is always annoying at best. Most people who have it know there are certain situations  which will  trigger a faint or near-syncope, and, like  you, they learn to get close to the ground before they fall down. This is very wise.  While vasovagal syncope (or as it is now sometimes called, neurocardiogenic syncope) is relatively common and not dangerous in itself, there is the potential for there to be some other, more serious problem (extremely rare, but you should have it ruled out). There are tests for all of this, to help sort it out, but while  I truly believe you have no serious problem, it still should be evaluated. I also feel that because of this problem you should definitely have cardiac clearance before having any sort of general anesthesia. I would, if I were you, insist on this, and explain the reason for your concern. While  normal events are tolerable, anesthesia is a whole different ballgame, and not something one encounters in everyday life. I personally believe everyone having surgery involving anesthesia should be required to have cardiac clearance, and in many centers this  is a requirement anyway, so I don't think it would be seen as an unreasonable request.   I  hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please stay in  touch with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I'm a 33 year old female with no signifigent medical history. In June I had an episode of incredible chest pain accompanied by difficulty breathing and sweats. After 20 hours of rest and no improvement I let my husband take me to the hospital. They kept me for 2 nights and started me on blood pressure and cholesterol medications. Because I was breast feeding my 5 month old, have a 2 year old and because I couldn't get any of the test results or speak with a doctor I checked myself out. I figured if no one was coming in to see me they must not be that concerned.  I put off seeing a doctor until one day  a month later when I felt dizzy, sweaty and light headed. I went to my general who gave me the usual you're a female, you're too young just ignore it speech, then after listening to my heart he heard constant bigeminy and immediately referred me to a cardiologist. Who then gave me the same speech. After he did an EKG and saw lots of pvc's he decided to do a 24 hr holter. I wore the holter for 20 hours and there were over 35,000 benign skipped beats. I also got my test results from the hospital.  sgot-ast 63 cpk 227 lactic dehydrogenase 730  My Cardiologist is unconcerned. Should I be? What does this all mean? Yesterday I felt nauseaus, lightheaded and shaky. Today I have mild chest pain. I don't want to ignore this if I shouldn't, but I also don't want to get all worked up over nothing.  Any advice from Cardiologists would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: over 35,000 skipped beats in 20 hrs (cpk,ldh,sgot result)",
    "content": "Hello -  While your initial symptoms of severe chest pain, shortness of breath and sweats made your decision  to be seen urgently a wise one (and if this ever happens again I would recommend you go to the ER immediately and not wait so long, even though it seems everything has turned out negative so far). These are symptoms which cannot be ignored, even though there is no known  heart disease.  As for the PVCs, when one's heart goes into fairly constant bigemeny, it produces what seem like an incredible number of PVCs. Given that this was over a 24 hour period puts it into some perspective however, from a clinician's point of view. It means you averaged 24 PVCs per minute,  which still seems like a lot, but only if your average heart rate was 48 beats per minute. So you see, you actually had periods where the rhythm corrected briefly. This is not to dismiss nor minimize the discomfort and anxiety this must cause, but to try and put it into some sort of context. PVCs are, in and of themselves, almost never of any diagnostic value. They are not, in themselves, predictive of anything. Some  people actually have ventricular bigemeny as their regular rhythm. Of these, some have it go away when they become active, only to have it return when they are at rest. For others it works the other way around. Generally, though, in the absence of any significant heart disease, they mean nothing -- technically speaking. And yet they are among the most disturbing of symptoms  and one of the most unpleasant sensations one can experience.  Yet, again, some of those who have this as their \"normal\" rhythm never are aware of them. It is a very random thing as far as perception goes.  The lightheadedness and dizziness is, in all likelihood, a by-product of the blood pressure medicine you were put on, if, indeed, you are still taking it. If you had high blood pressure while in the hospital, however, you may have simply been  stressed by the (justifed) anxiety over the symptoms that brought you there, and then the experience of being in the hospital (some patients run a higher than normal pressure until they are discharged and, after returning to the relative peace and familiarity of home, it returns to normal).  The cholesterol medication would suggest you have elevated cholesterol, but I wonder at both  of these prescriptions. Among your lab results provided, you don't include your lipid profile,  nor do you provide a figure for your blood pressure while  in the hospital nor currently. These would be helpful, if available, since you are young and presumably otherwise healthy.   If your cardiologist is not concerned about the PVCs I can understand this, but you need to have the reasoning for that conveyed to you. Too often doctors forget that what doesn't concern them may still concern the patient a great deal. I am more interested in your blood pressure and cholesterol at this point, since the reason for those meds is not given.  The PVCs, as horribly unsettling as they can be, are almost never a cause for concern.  That  doesn't mean, however, that nothing else could be going on. I'd love to be able to take a deeper look.  I hope, at least as far as the PVCs are concerned, that I have been able to ease your mind somewhat. I know this must be very difiicult to put up with, but when  you are able to relax it will  likely become less and less of an issue. It's not easy, but it's true.   Best of luck to you, and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 59 year old male, and was diagnosed with a benign arrhythmia a few years ago. The symtoms are PVCs, and occasionally my heart goes haywire for approx 15 seconds with irregular beats. This usually stops on it's own, but I can stop it by coughing or holding my nose and blowing down it. I was prescribed 2.5mg bisoprolol, but I have now cut down to 1.25mg. I am also on 40mg statin and one 75mg aspring a day. This is because my chol was 4.9 (HDL .75).  Anyway, over the last couple of years I've picked up half a dozen viruses, the last one affecting my chest. These usually take about two months to clear up, with wheezing and a dry chesty cough. I've read that bisoprolol can worsen asthma. I don't think I've got it however (peak flow around 500 when I have a virus), but I was wondering if bisporolol can inhibit and prolong recovery from these viruses by affecting the tubes.  If yes, then I'm ditching the drug, as I'd rather have the palpatations. Would aprreciate any views and advice. Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Side Effects of Bisoprolol",
    "content": "Hello -  Like all  beta blockers, bisoprolol can, in certain selected patients, aggravate pre-existing bronchospasm, but it is beta-1 selective (cardioselective) and less likely to cause this problem  than most beta blockers. Your peak flow is excellent,  so it doesn't seem likely that you have asthma, and the drug is unlikely to predispose to bronchitis.   The treatment of PVCs is usually optional and reserved for patients who can't tolerate the sensation of them.  The fact that you can abort rapid or irregular episodes of heart rhythm by performing certain types of Valsalva maneuvers suggests strongly that you also have atrial arrhythmias. These are rarely serious, and if the PVCs and other arrhythmias don't cause you undue anxiety or otherwise hamper your functioning,  you could probably do without the bsoprolol, even though it's unlikely to be contributing to your respiratory infections.   That being said, if you should decide to discontinue  the beta blocker (any beta blocker), you need to inform your doctor, and then be tapered off over a  period  of one to two weeks to avoid an unpleasant and possibly dangerous rebound effect.   You could  try tapering off the drug for a while to see if your chest infections  are reduced in frequency or  severity and if so, and you can deal with the palpitations, then you'll probably feel better about the whole situation. It's a personal choice, but be sure to discuss it with your doctor first  if you decide to go off the  drug.  Hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "title": "Arrhythmia and Prehypertension",
    "content": "I am a 25 year old male who is becoming increasingly nervous about his health.  I've been checking my blood pressure pretty regularly lately with an electronic blood pressure meter that I bought.  This blood pressure meter also detects pulse and irregular heartbeat.  Ever since I started monitoring my blood pressure (roughly 2 months), it's been in the pre-hypertension range.  I started around 145/85 and now am down to about 140/80 or thereabouts.  I saw a doctor just to establish because I'm living in a new area.  For one amazing day my blood pressure was about 120/80, and it happened to be when I was at the doctor.  As there was no indication that my blood pressure was high (or borderline high) he made no mention of it.  I had been trying to eat healthier and to me it felt as though it was working, and I did not mention that my previous measurements of my blood pressure were not in line with the ones at the doctor's office.  I even checked again with my personal blood pressure meter and it was in line with the doctor's (119/75).  Ever since then, while it hasn't risen to dangerous levels, I have not seen a systolic pressure lower than 127, and it's typically between 130-135.  Diastolic has been pretty close to normal during this time.  I've been trying to eat healthier and have lost around 10 lbs.  I've been walking/ jogging close to 4 miles about 4 times per week.  I'm 6'1\" 190 lbs now.  Though I have seen improvement, I'm still worried.  In addition to my blood pressure being on the high side, the sensor for an irregular heartbeat has been going off with frequency (though not all the time) on my blood pressure meter.  The only time I remember a doctor speaking to me about me having an irregular heartbeat was around six ears ago when I visited my college campus' clinic because I didn't feel well.  The doctor described my heartbeat as \"regularly irregular\" at the time, and I had borderline high blood pressure at the time as well.  She kind of brushed it off as nothing to be extremely worried about as I was a stressed college student during finals.  At that time I also consumed a lot of caffeine and (very rarely) smoked, which I had told the campus doctor.  In the last two months I've had a total of 2 cans of soda and a few glasses of iced tea, and I've had absolutely none within the last week.  I've essentially sworn off caffeine, but the irregular heartbeat seems to remain.  I'm currently applying for a job that requires that I pass an annual physical.  I don't know if these (pre-hypertension and irregular heartbeat) are things that could potentially cause me to fail that physical.  I don't want to lose a job opportunity over this, and I really want to make sure I'm taking the right steps to correcting my health issues moving forward.  Any advice you can provide would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Arrhythmia and Prehypertension",
    "content": "Hello -  You know,  blood pressure can vary quite a bit during the course of a day,  depending upon myriad factors. This is why people who haven't been diagnosed with hypertension are not encouraged to monitor their own blood pressure,  since it is difficult to assign meaning to the findings. You mention your BP has been \"borderline\" frequently. Actually it  may be  your anxiety (which causes you to check so frequently to start with) is causing your cardiac output to increase and your pressure to rise a little when you're checking it.   That being  said, now that you've established a statistical baseline that's  higher than normal, you may as well continue to monitor it, but try doing it this way: do it only once or twice a day, at specific times, for instance in the morning when you first get up, seated on the edge of the bed, and again late in the day, perhaps after dinner or during your quiet time in the evening (if you have a quiet time -- some of us don't). When you're relaxed (and as an anxious person you may actually be more relaxed when at the doctor's), your pressure is likely to be more accurate. There are peaks and valleys during the day, just as with blood glucose. Imagine if people had access to blood sugar  testing without a diganosis. They'd discover their BS levels to be quite high at  various  times during the day and many would  diagnose themselves as diabetic or pre-diabetic (a status which is somewhat controversial  anyway).   Then there is the matter of irregular  heartbeat. First, the electronic home BP testing devices are easily tricked by bodily movement or deep, sighing respirations.  Second, we all have occasional premature heartbeats, some of us have them most all the time, while others have them only occasionally. If you're one of those who is actually \"regularly irregular\" (bigemeny, trigemeny or one of the other  variations on the \"group beating\" theme) then you'll  likely always get that alert from  the machine. It doesn't mean anything in and of itself, but once one becomes aware of it, it starts to become another anxiety-producing issue.  This is one that's much better ignored by the patient unless there are actual symptoms associated with it (such as dizziness or annoying palpitations). Even then they are almost always benign, but with symptoms they become harder to ignore.   An occasional  premature heartbeat, which would probably only show up in a very detailed pre-employment physical which included an EKG (rare), would be unliikely to disqualify an otherwise healthy young person. \"Borderline high\" blood  pressure might elicit a comment or a re-check, but likely wouldn't get you knocked out of the process either. Blood pressures consistently above 140/90 are conisidered worthy of following and, if they don't self-correct, then continued,  occasional  monitoring and possible medical treatment is considered. It's usually only when there is significant elevation on two or more occasions that healthcare professionals begin to pay close attention to BP as a potential  problem, and then they want to rule out possible underlying causes first.  Again, if you are going to continue to monitor your own BP, try to do it only 2-3 times a day, and preferably during quiet times, as close as possible to the same times every day or so.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with as as needed, and good luck on your possible new job.\n\n",

    "title": "MVP, Caffeine, Working out",
    "content": "I am a 32 year old female. 5'4\" 110lbs. I have been diagnosed with MVP. Both my grandmother and mother have this condition. Lately  mine has been becoming increasingly bothersome. My heart will \"flutter\" causing me to catch my breath and cough-as per usual. But, recently my heart will begin to pound rather hard and it makes me feel weak and lightheaded. This feeling usually only lasts for a moment, but it causes me great anxiety. I definitely notice these symptoms if I have any caffeine at all. I have cut all caffeine out of my diet, but accidentally drank a caffeinated latte yesterday, which may have exacerbated the problem. My blood pressure is always normal and my pulse, even when my heart feels like it's racing and pounding, is usually around 70-95. My questions are these: Could I die from MVP? It frightens me every time I have a MVP episode. Also,  not sure if I should go on Beta-Blockers or not. I've always heard \"once you start them you will have to always take them\". Is this true?  I used to work out 3-4 times a week, but now am afraid too, as I think I may cause myself to have a heart attack! I know this is totally silly, but is it ok for me to work out even though I have MVP?  How much caffeine is too much?  I am a hypochondriac, of sorts, I think; however, this issue really bothers me and is starting to affect my daily life. I also notice MVP episodes if I become really tired or have a lack of sleep. Thank you so much for taking time to possibly answer my questions. I certainly appreciate any advice.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: MVP, Caffeine, Working out",
    "content": "Hello -  FIrst, you are not being silly. You have a family history of MVP, which is an extremely benign condition, but which carries with it a greater incidence of the sort of arrhythmic episodes than normal (and which are common anyway in the general population, but people with MVP seem to have them more often and react to them with more anxiety in general).  The fact is these episodes are so normal and common that the  importance of MVP becomes exaggerated beyond its actual significance. Still, it is worth knowing one has it, if only because it helps explain why the episodes occur and why you feel more anxious about them than someone without MVP might (there is no understood reason  for this, but MVP and anxiety/panic disorder tend to go hand-in-hand).   Aerobic exercise is actually encouraged for people with MVP, and in most cases this will cause a reduction in the frequency of premature heartbeats and other sensations of palpitation. Caffeine will cause more premature beats in any person, as a rule, and wth MVP the frequency is just that much more likely to increase; caffeine is usually the first thing suggested to reduce. It won't do any harm, but you should be prepared, if you choose to ingest caffeine, to experience more palpitations than you would if you did not. It's as simple as that. It's a stimulant, and usually the first of a series of usual suspects when palpitation is the main complaint. You simply have to decide whether or not you're willing to put up with more palpitations or not vs. caffeine use. Again, it won't do any harm,  except to possibly make you more anxious. If you can manage that part, it's ok to drink the occasional coffee or soft drink. Just be aware you'll be more likely to feel some flutters or flip-flops during and for a while  afterward.   The fatigue and sleep deprivation factors also hold true for the general population where palpitations are concerned, and are sometimes slightly moreso in people with MVP.  MVP is so common, especially among the female population, that  it is considered by some to be a variant of normal. However, people who have MVP Syndrome are inclined to be anxious, consider themselves hypochondriacal (but really usually just more aware of their own somatic sensations such as those palpitations), and  often suffer from inexplicable fatigue, although they still tolerate exercise as well as the general population, and benefit from it even more.  I certainly hope this is helpful to you. Please stay in touch with us, especially if you have any further questions. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

As one who has chosen to depend on caffeine to get my energy level up in the morning, I have accepted the annoyance of premature beats myself. It's really just a personal choice, and there was a time when I excluded caffeine in order to get some relief from the sensations it caused.   Exercise is a very important part of keeping everything in balance, so your intention to return to a regular program is also good news. Take it slow at first, mainly so as to not pull any muscles. The most common mistake people make after a hiatus is to plunge back in at the level they were doing before they took time off.  Best of luck to you and please to stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 22 y/o female and I have had random little \"flutters\", or flip -flops that feel like they are coming from my heart as long as I can remember. The last 3 months  they seem to be getting more frequent though, and last night I had a particularly long episode of these \"flutters\" and also seemed to feel a slight pressure on my chest, but i\"m not sure if that may have been just me psyching myself out since it was lasting so long. Usually it will flip-flop every few heartbeats for a few minutes and then stop, and it usually seems to happen when I am resting, like just sitting reading or watching tv. I am 5'6\", 140lbs and I work out 4-5 times a week, running and light weight lifting, and eat pretty healthy. I've drank coffee since I was about 14 up until about a month ago, when I switched to decaf, thinking that it might stop these palpitations. it did seem to help until last night when I had a really long episode of them that lasted about 30mins. I don't smoke, but I am on birth control pills. I don't have a family history of heart disease, although my uncle suffered a minor heart attack about a year ago due to stress (he's in his 40's). My dad (54yo) says that he has always had the same little flutters since he was a kid, and he's in excellent shape and has never had any problems because of them. I've never had any chest or arm pain with these palpitations. Sometimes I feel a shortness of breath and light headed and try to breathe deep to calm down but again I'm not sure if i just get nervous and freak myself out. I've never felt nauseous or like I was going to pass out. They tend to happen more often in the evening, when I'm lying in bed or watching tv. I've never had a problem with them while I was exercising. Do you think that they could just be stress related? I know lately I have been a little bit stressed, but nothing overwhelming. I am thinking about seeing a doctor but in the area I live in I have to drive 40 mins just to get to a clinic and I don't curently have health insurance so I thought I ask here first and see if these are symptoms that could be dangerous, or warning signs that I should look for.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Krista_279,  Heart palpitations are very common and are often not dangerous.  However, occasionally they can be a sign of an underlying heart rhythm problem.  If at all possible I would recommend you see your doctor to have an EKG performed.  If your doctor agrees you may need to see a cardiologist to determine if you need more heart rhythm testing such as a holter monitor (basically a portable long recording EKG machine that can record heart rhythms continuously for 1-3 days).  The holter monitor is particularly helpful when the symptoms are only intermittent and not able to be caught on an EKG in the office.  With some heart rhythm problems medication may be needed to keep it under control.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pregnancy and palpitations",
    "content": "Hello -  Your doctor is absolutely correct on this one. Palpitations are fairly common anyway in the general population, and much moreso with MVP. Add pregnancy and they become almost unavoidable and are completely normal. Only if you were to experience significant symptoms (prolonged, rapid, forceful beating and/or lightheadedness) would you require any sort of medical intervention, and even then it's usually just a hormone/crowding issue. However,  with symptoms such as I just described, it becomes more difficult to ignore, especially in pregnancy, and there are things that can be done to minimize that sort of thing if it should take place, which is fairly unlikely.   I certainly hope this is helpful and that you have an otherwise uneventful pregnancy. Congratulations!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 21 year old female in pretty good shape and lately the past 5 months Ive been having palpitations. I have never had them before so this is scary to me. I am a student so when i first started having them i went to the University hospital where they only did a resting EKG on me which was normal and the doctor said not to worry about it. I first starting noticing going up stairs. Now I only have them during exercise and its freaking me out! Sometimes it feels like my breath gets taken away for a split second and other times i just feel a skipped beat in my chest. The very first one I had, which was goin up steps, made me light headed but that was the only time. I don't drink caffine or any other stimulants. I drink alcohol but not very often maybe two weekends out of the month. My family has no history of heart problems once so ever. I have chronic costochondritis for about a year now and occasionaly protein shows up in my urine... i don't know if that has any link to it but just to let you know.  I feel very nervous now when i start to run because of these skipped heart beats, so i usually try to avoid it but i love to run! Should I be worried? Do you recommend gettin more tests done?\n\n",

    "content": "I would advise you to seek further evaluation for this.  There are several things that may be going on.  Often, the \"missed  beats\" that people feel are early contractions of the ventricles known as premature ventricular contractions (PVC's).  PVC's are generally normal and when the heart rate goes up, the PVC's go away.  PVC's that increase with increasing heart rate are concerning and should be further evaluated.  There are a few tests that may be helpful for you.  One is an EKG stress test.  Basically they put you on a treadmill or stair stepper and monitor your heart rhythms.  Also, a 24 hour holter monitor may be useful.  This is basically an EKG machine that you wear for 24 hours to make a continuous recording of your heart rhythms.  These tests can be helpful in assessing rhythm problems that occur during exercise.  You may need a referral to a cardiologist to have some of these tests done.  Keep us updated.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello KCDwv32 - While waiting for Dr. Lowe to add his thoughts in response to your most recent post I thought I'd throw in some of my own, as I have been unable to post for a couple weeks here due to strictly computer-related problems. At any rate, first of all, yes, I think that, as Dr. Lowe had already suggested, you might want to consider cutting back your fitness regimen, at least until the stress test has been completed. I suspect it will likely turn up nothing abnormal, although you may have some PVCs or PACs (Premature Atrial Contractions) show up during the test. Although it has long been believed that exercise-induced PVCs are a potential cause for concern, that mainly applies to people with known heart disease. It is fairly unlikely that you have heart disease, but you could possibly have a fairly common condition known as mitral valve prolapse (MVP) , which can cause a whole variety of benign arrhythmias including PVCs, PACs, atypical chest pain, intermittent fatigue (although exercise is usually well tolerated), and even anxiety.   The nature of PVCs and PACs is to come and go, and  sometimes they can be linked to something (caffeine overuse, stress, etc.) but just as often the underlying cause remains an annoying mystery. They are almost never diagnostic of anything serious unless found in the presence of significant heart disease. You sound like you are a healthy and fit young woman (which makes it all the more difficult to slow down the usual fitness regimen, but bear with us here). Since your doctor has decided to do a stress test you may as well go along with the program and not test yourself by jogging or running until the stress test has been done. Brisk walking should be fine, however.   Oh, regarding that cramping in your right chest during jogging, that doesn't sound cardiac related, and probably is just a variation on the \"stitch\" some people get when running. However, once again, since you have a stress test coming up anyway, you may as well keep the exercise at a fairly low level until you know for certain that everything is fine. I'm betting it is, but medical issues aren't decided on a bet.   Please do keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again - Well to get straight to the point, yes! A lowered potassium level can definitely affect your heart. Now a lot of people would say 3.5 is the lower limit of normal and 3.4 is just a hair below that, but some labs now place the lower limit at 3.8, and many cardiologists will, when dealing with a patient with arrhythmic complaints want it to be at least 3.8 and preferably a little higher. Low K can cause palpitations, premature beats, various tacharrhythmias, etc. Also, some people seem to have a metabolic flaw that causes their serum potassium to be low much of the time, despite eating foods containing K. When this is seen consistently a doctor often may prescribe a slow-release potassium supplement. It's worth a try anyway, given the complaint and the lab results. If your heart were to settle down that would answer the question for sure.   Good luck with this and we will be waiting to hear how things turn out.\n\n",

Your potassium level is \"borderline\" low but when cardiac rhythms are in question, it is nice to have potassium levels closer to 4.  Eating potassium rich foods or taking a multivitamin will likely solve this issue for you.  I would agree with the assessment of the right sided chest pain also.

I was walking to class going up the hill and I realized that as I reached flat land and slowed down my heart rate didnt and I couldnt get it to stop. Then it started skipping. Luckily i was at the Hospital already for my class so I walked into the ER. They did blook work and said everything was normal except my K+ was low at 3.2 but that wouldn't have caused what they said was SVT's. They gave me a holter monitor for 24 hrs and it did skip while i wore it I just have to wait for the results.  The ER doctor said not to worry about it and the nurse said it might have been an panic attack which could be true because I have been really nervous about this whole heart thing. Anyways what do you think of the situation? thanks for the replies!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - Well here's the deal: for some reason your body is not maintaining an adequate potassium (K) level. This happens in some individuals for reasons that can be figured out with a little detective work, but in some there's no readily apparent reason. This will cause a lot of symptoms including rapid heart rate, irregular beats and, yes, even SVT. K is essential to the proper functioning of the electrical systems in  your body, especially your heart and those serving the large muscle groups. Loss of K can come from something as simple as a diet that doesn't include enough (some foods high in  K are bananas, oranges, potatoes, avacados, dried apricots, etc. Adequate (but not excessive) fluid intake is also important. Getting dehydrated can lower K levels. People  who take  diuretics (fluid pills) have to take a potassium replacement, and some of us just need a medically supervised K supplement to maintain normal levels.   As I think I mentioned before, a K level of 3.2 is not considered extremely low, but most cardiologists will prefer it to be closer to 4.0 (3.5 - 3.8 is considered normal). Don't try over-the-counter potassium supplements,however, as too much is as big a problem as too  little, and can be very dangerous. There is a relatively inexpensive generic form of controlled-release potassium available by prescription and can be very helpful in cases where there's no obvious explanation for the low levels.   Panic attack is another possibility, but as I gathered from your post and I know from observation and experience, panic attacks are caused by symptoms as often as they are the cause of symptoms, so while it's important to determine if panic attacks are a part of the overall picture, it's not something easily measured as by a laboratory test. On the other hand, potassium levels can readily be measured by blood testing, and you have had,on more than one occasion, a low K level accompanying these symptoms. Based on that alone I would say this is the likely underlying cause of the symptoms and the symptoms may have caused a panic attack, which would only make all  the symptoms worse and longer lasting.   Interestingly, panic and anxiety cause increased production of adrenaline by our bodies, and adrenaline release can cause loss of K, so the two problems can  be interrelated on  more than one level.  Still, it makes sense to go to the obvioius first,  and in this case the obvious  thing is that your K levels have been low on occasions when you've had these unpleasant symptoms, so it would seem reasonable  to ask if your cardiologist might prescribe a slow-release potassium supplement for you. Make sure the cardio doctor knows about the ER visit, what led to it, and the low K level it turned up.  In the meantime try adding some potassium-rich foods to your diet (unless you're already doing that). And again, don't try the do-it-yourself approach to potassium replacement, as too much can be more dangerous than too little.   Good luck to you and please stay in touch. We'll be interested to know what your cardiologist has to say about all this.\n\n",

I have had an echo for mitral valve prolapse which was clear, my potassium level is 4.5, my thyroid and hb are normal and I don't have any stimulants. I had a stress test and my cardiologist said he wanted to make my heart rate so high that my normal sinus rhythm would \"knock out\" the ectopics. They started straight away and were very frequent (average 1 in 4) - I had to take my heart rate up to 180 before they stopped - I don't take it this high at the gym, and therefore have the ectopics for the whole time. My cardiologist wasn't sure if they were related to benzo. withdrawal or not and I have to go back in 6 months. I am scared of exertion now because I know what's coming - have you known this before, and was it a positive sign that even though it took almost to the end, the stress test did wipe them out even though it was at a high heart rate?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Tinytears - Boy, I certainly can empathize with you on this one. The problem, such as it is (and it is a great one for a lot of people who are otherwise just fine, because of the intense anticipatory anxiety iit can cause), is a common one. While \"overdriving\" the ventricular ectopic pacemaker can work, there is also a paradoxical factor which often affects these beats. Some people have them mostly at rest and they go away with exertion, only to start up again when the exercise is over. Then there are others who get them when they start to exert, which is even more disturbing and frustratiog. The latter situation is more often seen in people with a high resting level of stimulants/irritants in their bloodstream,and so is often associated with benzo withdrawal. That doesn't mean that's definitely the cause in your case, but it certainly must be considered.   In some patients this pattern also just comes and goes, usually showing up during times of stress. Since benzo withdrawal can be associated with stress in a number of different ways, it does seem like a likely culprit in your case. At any rate, if you find  this pattern lingers you will probably start to become less sensitive to it, but if you don't, don't feel bad. It is extremely unsettling to have this stuff start up whenever you try to exercise. Try to walk through it if you can, unless, of course, it makes you lightheaded, in which case you should advise your doctor. Apparently that doesn't happen or youw wouldn't have been able to push yourself past the overdrive threshold during the stress test.   It's scary stuff, but I think you've proven that in your case it is benign -- but that doesn't make it any less worrisome when it happens, which only releases more adrenaline and produces more premature beats.   It's crazymaking, but it really is benign. Good luck with this, and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

I have read a lot about benzo. withdrawal so that I understand fully what I am doing, but although some people complain of palpitations, my heart rate can be quite slow but still throwing out ectopics. I understand that when in withdrawal, however controlled, the brain appears to be in a \"hyper sensitive\" state and therefore overreacts to things like adrenaline and noradrenaline. Does this stop when you eventually get off benzos. altogether? I can put up with this temporarily but not for ever! Many thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again Tinytears - Sorry to be so long in getting back to you with this reply, but I've been having some computer problems. Hopefully that's out of the way now.   You seem to be very well-read on the problems associated with benzo withdrawal and how the brain and descending associated systems react under these circumstances. As for your specific question regarding withdrawal-induced hypersensitivity and how long that might last, the answer is necessarily a little vague. While theoretically this should resolve fairly quickly once withdrawal is complete (and by now it may be), sometimes ectopy can be persistent once it has been awakened. This is often something that happens following an emotional stressful or physically traumatic event, and I would certainly call withdrawal from benzodiazepines something that could fall into one or both of those classifications. So, while it is likely the ectopic beats will diminish or disappear, chances are about even that they will not go away entirely, and may persist frequently for an indeterminate period. Once you're throught the withdrawal stage you should have a better idea about how this is likely to go. Eventually, in the absence of organic heart disease, they should go away or at least become intermitten (like most of us have them) once again.  The lack of feeling hypersensitive in itself should be such a relief that the accompanying symptoms, of which ectopic heartbeats are just one, should make everything seem a lot better, assuming there is no underlying anxiety problem which may still require medical management, as this can often be the sole cause of a hyper-alert central nervous system.   Oh, one other thing you mentioned was that your heart rate can be quite slow and still throw premature beats. This is actually a normal situation, although that may seem contradictory. Slowing of the heart rate and/or an overall slow rate involves stimulation of the vagus nerve, which is one of the primary causes of otherwise benign PVCs. I realize this doesn't seem fair, but it really is normal.   Hopefully by now things have already quieted down. Please do stay in touch and again, my apologies for taking so long to reply.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi John - Many thanks again for your reply. I don't know if you know much about benzo. withdrawal, but it seems to get harder the lower the dose. I have been on 5mg Diazepam at night for 3 weeks  and usually I have stabilized by now, but I am still getting the ectopics - really easily - I had a rich chocolate pudding last Thursday and that was enough to bring them on in 15 mins! , someone has suggested that it may be the tyrosine as well as the caffeine. Even if I just walk fast at the moment they start. I have never been so sensitive before, but I guess I've never been in this withdrawal position before either! It's going to take about another year to get off them at the rate that I am going (Ashton Manual) and it just seems like forever. Can you explain what's happening to me physiologically so that I understand? Hope I'm not being too technical! Many thanks indeed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there - No, you're not being too technical, and this sort of thing can be really scary and annoying. Diazepam, among the benzos, seems to be the one with the greatest withdrawal difficulty. Not impossible, but as you point out, often seemingly endless. It depends on the individual, but generally diazepam is harder to \"disconnect\" from than most of the others. That's in great part why it's fallen out of favor for long-term use.   What happens (and I'm sure you know this already) is that the effect of the drug blunts the body's reaction to normal stimuli. When it's withdrawn, the threshold is so much lower that everything seems to be hot-wired. It's a relativity problem, and the sensitivity takes varying times to adjust to normal while this is going on. For this reason it does seem to become more difficult as the dose gets lower, because at the point where you are now, you're stuck between a rock and a hard place for a while because you can't really just stop taking the medication, and yet each time you do, it causes something of a rebound effect in smaller and smaller increments, until you finally reach the point where it's really no longer \"touching\" the nerve center. At the same time you have to consider the body's innate ability to adjust after the blunting chemical is gone.   During this long, slow period of withdrawal, your body continues to be \"teased\" by the lower amounts of the drug and the rebound is more noticeable. To stop outright, as I'm sure you know, could result in anything from unbearably intense anxiety to grand mal seizures. You've definitely taken the less bumpy path. It's hard to realize that unless you've seen or experienced abrupt withdrawal from something similar.  Since  the heart is such a great barometer of the emotional state in normal (non-drug-altered) situations, it is rather like a voltmeter run amok during this  period.  Very sensitive and irritable, much like the post-heart surgery patient. (The heart doesn't like being touched or handled either, and it takes a while for it to get over the insult, often with similar results). The continuous introduction/reduction of diazepam keeps the heart in this \"cranky\" mood til  the whole process is over. It should become less so over time, but it is different for each individual.   I'm  not sure I've made things any clearer, but I sure did use a lot of words! Hopefully this is some help to you. It will get better, and the upside/downside is that you will likely, at some point, develop a certain degree of tolerance for all the ectopy, at which point it  will start to subside,  because then your own emotional response and (natural) anticipation of the premature beats will then start to go away. As you've said, we can only stand so much of this. Luckily, there is a balance in things that makes our tolerance slowly go up over time, and this, in turn, shuts down part of the built-in \"other drug\", adrenaline, which is what is really the culprit.   It is, of coure, possible to try and counteract the overproduction of adrenaline during the benzo withdrawal by use of a beta blocking drug, but then you have the same situation all over again when  you want to quit that -- although the beta blocker is far less of a problem in many ways than diazepam. You just can't stop either one of them cold. It is worth considering, though. Metaprolol or another beta blocker might be a short-term way to ease this particular symptom (the premature beats) during the benzo withdrawal. The beta blocker could then be withdrawn over a period of weeks instead of months.  Just a thought.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi John - Blimey, that was a quick and thorough reply! I guess I sort of know all of this, but wanted to make sure that I wasn't kidding myself and hear it from someone else! My biggest fear is that after I withdraw, if the heart doesn't settle, I'll end up having a cardiac ablation which I really wouldn't want to do! Diazepam is the chosen benzo. for withdrawal because it has the longest half-life, which is meant to give you a smoother blood serum reduction - makes sense actually and is what Prof. Heather Ashton tells you to switch to - I was on a short life benzo. before and you practically get a mini-withdrawal every day on those because they come and go so quickly. Anyway, beta bockers would be a last resort for me because I'm trying not to depend on anything else but my determination, so wish me luck! Thank you so much for your time and I will keep you posted. I've got some liquid Diazepam for my next cut so I can make it smaller - think I cut too much last time and that's why I've suffered for longer than usual - slow and steady wins the race as they say! Regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  As strange as it may seem, it is perfectly normal to have occasional premature beats (PACs, PVCs and even premature junctional beats -- PJCs) during exercise. While exercise can sometimes make them quiet down if they occur at rest, they can also occur during exercise because of the adrenaline factore. And since your echo and stress test were clean, there's really no need to be concerned, although I realize they can be pretty hard to ignore. Do your best, though.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello all,  I'm 35,female,smoker.  End of February, went to the ER with pain on the right side of my chest, rapid heart rate and a hot feeling going up to my neck. They ran all sorts of tests (stress test, EKG, echocardiogram, chest x-ray, CT scan, bloodwork). All came back fine.  Two weeks later went back to ER with heart rate of 120. They tested for thyroid. It came back normal and sent me home.   First cardiologist put me on Atenolol and said it could be perimenopause (history of early menopause in the family).  Second cardiologist said nothing was wrong with my heart and said anxiety/depression.  Family doctor ran more bloodwork and only thing that came back was slightly elevated cholesterol. She recommended a different cardiologist.  I like this one because he actually listened to me. He thinks this could be inappropriate sinus tachycardia and told me to wean off the beta blocker to prepare for a holter monitor.   3 days after I went off the beta blocker I had an episode where from counting my pulse I could tell it was 120. This lasted for a couple of hours. No chest pain, but the warm feeling was there and I was very tired. The cardiologist said to go back on half a tablet of the Atenolol for 2 weeks and I'll go off it right before I get the holter monitor.  I don't have these episodes all the time, but it's very frustrating. I've also lost 20 pounds and I generally only eat once a day because I get full very quickly and I'm just not hungry anymore. Take today. I got some wings. I ate 6 of them around noon and I couldn't eat any more of them.   Could this by inappropriate sinus tachycardia? I haven't found much online about this, and what I have found doesn't sound very good. Sorry this post is long. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "The condition of inappropriate sinus tachycardia simply means that the heart is going faster than normal when it shouldn't be.  Thus, by definition, if you are not exercising or doing something else that should cause an increased heart rate and you have tachycardia then you do have inappropriate sinus tachycardia.  The problem then becomes this: is the tachycardia actually a symptom of some other thing that is going on.  With your weight loss I would be very suspicious that something other than a purely cardiac issue is brewing.  Checking the thyroid was appropriate.    They are quite rare but pheochromocytomas are also a cause of intermittent sinus tachycardia.  There are other causes as well.  I would recommend you follow up with your primary doctor and cardiologist to continue to search for other possible causes.  Make sure you've had a thorough search before it is called idiopathic tachycardia (unknown etiology) or designated a purely heart issue.  Best wishes.  Keep us updated as to what you find out if you don't mind.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello senagod -   When you  went  back to the cardiologist I hope you got the answers you were looking for. This doctor seemed easier to work with anyway, so hopefully that went well. There is one thing I would take issue with, however: beta blockers are not generally used, at least for cardiac purposes, as an as-needed drug. By the time the drug would start to work the problem would  probably be gone, and stopping the drug has the potential to just aggravate the problem all over again (rebound effect). While beta blockers are used at times for migraines and stage fright (fear of public address situations), the former has time to have an effect since migraines usually last a while anyway, and in the latter it is given in advance of the event. One-time use may not cause much of a rebound effect, but in someone who needs the beta blockade effect therapeutically, as-needed (PRN) is unlikely to work very well. I'd be more inclined to want to see the lowest possible effective dose taken on a daily basis. However, I'm not the doctor.   Hopefully by now this has all been resolved. Please do keep in touch.\n\n",

My blood sugar is great, my cholesterol is low, and my blood pressure is normal. No surgery history.  Recently (last month or so) I have been experiencing a sharp stabbing pain in the heart area that lasts for a few seconds and I also get a rapid heartbeat which occurs after the sharp pain or on its own with no pain. The pain usually only comes when I am sitting down watching TV and sometimes after I have eaten although not always.  I do not have any other symptoms besides sharp stabbing pain and rapid heartbeat.  Sometimes I will also get what I think is PVC and my heart feels like it skips a beat and then I get a pounding heartbeat which takes my breath away.  This always seems to happen randomly when I am at rest. I run sometimes and run a mile or more on an incline and notice no pain in chest or heart area.  All of these symptoms seems to happen when I am at rest. I might also note that I have slight anxieties.  As a side note, I have an inflammation of the breastbone near the heart area because if I press on a certain spot it produces a very sharp pain but I do not think this is related to the above symptoms.   Any ideas or help is appreciated. I am really worried about all of this and I can't stop thinking that something might be wrong with me (which may be making it worse?).\n\n",

    "content": "I am 31 year old female and my past history of asd repair,mild to moderate mvp,moderate to severe tricuspid leak,low blood pressure and questionable vtach(meaning questionable to me because I still don't understand it). If someone can give me insight of vtach and how severe can it be. I been having some episodes for about 1 1/2 now. When I got tested last year it did not show up but something showed up on my echo. I had ekg done about 2 weeks ago and it showed something on my ekg and my heart rate was high. I have had a few episodes that it would go anywhere from 110 to 169 and sometime to 210. The only reason why I went to my cardio early is because I had an episode while driving and became short of breath,lip turned blue,right hand/arm turn ice cold,and chest pains. I usually go for check ups every 3 months due to tricuspid leak but went in a month early. My cardio diagnose me with vtachycardia and warned me to be careful. I am not allowed to participate in any strainous activity or pick up anything heavy until I go for another echo in which I go on Wed  and eps study. The only thing that concerns me is lip turning blue and right hand/arm turns completely ice cold before being diagnosed with vtach. I had symptoms of right hand/arm being ice cold and palpations not knowing this was not normal. I am currently taking toprol xl 25mg. I had complete blood work and it was normal. I am not in any stress and stress does not play a role in this-it was confirm by my cardio. Can family history of vtach play a role(on my mother side there are quite a few that needed pacemaker to correct this and the youngest is only 22 year old cousin) or can the valve problem play a role in this?  I do not smoke or drink any alcohol nor do I consume any caffeine and eat very healthly. Should I be concerned about this?  Can surgery correct this if necessary? Can history of asd repair be cause? Can asd repair with residue murmur be the cause?  Why can't I participate in strainous activity or pick up heavy objects until further notice? I do remember from my pedi cardio who did the surgery said that surgery is maybe needed in the future but he did not say when and on my record it does have this info. What does this mean?  I am pretty much calm about this and try not to be excited about this and be normal as possible and do my normal things like I was doing before but without strainous activity. Am I in denial or is this normal because I do not have any feeling toward this,I really feel calm being that I went through this before. Why do I feel calm about this? Any info will be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rosie75 -  I think what you're asking is what is the nature of V-tach and how serious can it become. That covers a lot of ground, actually, but I'll try to give you an overview. Here goes: V-tach (ventricular tachycardia) is one of the potenially more serious rapid arrhythmias one can experience. It originates in one or more irritable spots in one or both ventricles (lower 2 chambers) of the heart. The reason it is potentially serious and that your cardiologist has asked you to take it easy until more is known about the cause and potential of your particular problem is that it V-tach sometimes can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, a truly life-threatening arrhythmia.   All that having been said, V-tach is usually defined as 3 (or sometimes 5) premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in a row, and virtually everyone has PVCs from time to time and some of us have \"runs\" of them as well. While 3 to 5 in a run may constitute a definition of V-tach, and certainly warrants further study (especially if the patient has, as you do, some structural heart abnormalities), it is sustained V-tach (lasting more than 30 seconds) that is generally of the most concern, and even then some people tolerate it fairly well for even much longer periods.    So what's the big deal? It all depends. There is one measurement of the heart's ability to pump effectively, the ejection fraction (EF) of the left ventricle. A low ejection fraction is considered a sign of heart failure (failure of the heart to do its job up to normal expectations, not a sudden and total failure). In patients who have heart disease or abnormalities and who have shown even short runs of V-tach, a closer look is warranted and the EF is the most important number doctors look at in these cases. If the disease or abnormality is affecting the left ventricle severely enough to drop the EF below 50 per cent, then the patient will be treated, either by a beta blocker or perhaps with an implantable defibrillator, if V-tach is showing up on a regular basis. The lower (below 50) the EF, the more potentially serious the presence of occasional V-tach. If the EF is normal (50 and above - up to the 70s) then the V-tach is usually tolerated fairly well and sometimes nothing more is done than to prescribe a beta blocker. Your upcoming  echocardiogram should help determine your EF. The concurrent EP study is also going to tell the doctor a lot, because if V-tach cannot be induced during the study and your EF is near normal, you are less likely to be at risk and so less likely a candidate for an implantable defibrillator.  Your defective mitral valve is the most likely cause of your episodes of V-tach, and a defective mitral valve may cause weakening of the left ventricle (meaning a lowered EF).  The fact that you're feeling calm about this is just a personality thing. Some people would be worried, but others. if they feel fine between episodes, tend to forget about it. Your feeling calm about this is a positive thing, as it is one less stressor to make your heart misbehave.   Good luck to you and please let us know what you find out.\n\n",

I had fewer episode with rapid heart beating with toprol but it still happens, mainly if I go up or down a flight of stairs or extreme cold weather. I still get cold hand but now feet also with my lip turning blue sometimes. Just trying to be normal and hopefully be able to go back to the gym soon so I can be active again. Do you know why hand and feet turn cold eventough rest of body is warm and lip turning blue? Is the lip being blue due to being cold?Let you know more once I get the results.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again - Good that you got the echo done and hopefully that will help unravel the mystery.  Also good that the  Toprol has helped slow the heart rate some. The fact that your heart compensates for exertion (like stair climbing) is probably a good sign, although it depends in great part on what the echo shows.   There are a number of things, given your history,  which could be going on, but since there is an active investigation going on I wouldn't want to speculate too much, at least until we know more. As for the cold extremities and blue lips, at first I  was thinking  Raynaud's phenomenon,  but this actually sounds like your heart and/or lungs is/are causing a reflex shifting of resources. It may well be an inappropriate response to something, but it's hard to tell without further information. The  fact that your pulmonary valve is incompetent is consistent with this sort of thing happening,  and that may be at the bottom of all this. Again, the echo could possibly provide the answer if that's the case. We'll be very interested to learn what that shows.   Hang in there and let us know what you find out.\n\n",

Did blood work again to make sure and this time it showed something with thyriod. He thinks it's inflamation of the thyriod but endo will know more. Who knew it would be as simple as this. I go to my primary md tomorrow and get referred to endo to see about this. He is sure this is causing all my symptoms. This is such a relief that it is not my heart because I did not want to face another surgery eventhough I am strong enough to face anything but in back of me I was scared. I will still be on toprol for awhile until he see it more stable and will wean me off so I think by June when I have another follow up with cardio. I will go on medication for the inflamation and hope it will  go away. I can go back to the gym but if I feel off to slow down or stop so now I am happy to go back to my excercising routine. I am still alittle stump about this whole thing with thyriod and how if effects the heart. I don't know if you can answer this because it's not in cardio field but I will ask you just incase, How can you get inflamation of the thyriod and will it go away? Hoping that this will be the end of my heart trouble. Just want to say thanks again for all your help with infos.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rosie - Well  hindsight is 20/20, but the thyroid problem does make total sense. You may have had a low-level thyroid problem for a long time, and it finally got fired up. It would explain the symptoms for sure. I guess that's not something normally looked at when there is a more closely-related history already established, and of course it makes for a really weird coincidence, but someone found it and it really does make a lot of sense and fits the symptoms, so that's likely what it is.   You can develop thyroiditis at any age, but it usually shows up in the teens or early to mid 20's. You may just be  a late bloomer in that department, and some people really don't get diagnosed til there is a flareup anyway.   No one is quite certain why this happens to some people. It can be virally mediated in some, and in many cases there is either a family history of thyroid disease (not necessarily all the same type, either), The majority, though, are just programmed early on to develop it for reasons that aren't totally clear, and it rarely appears after the 30's.   This may wind up being something of an annoyance, but is so much less traumatic than another heart problem! It can be managed by one of a number of ways, whichever happens to be appropriate, and the symptoms should then pretty much go away. It could take a little while for it to get stable, but once it does you should notice a huge difference.   It's also nice to know that the pulmonary valve is functioning relatively well and that you have been given the caution light to return to working out. That should make you feel a lot better in itself.   Good news! Please do keep us updated.\n\n",

She is sending me for sleep study to find out my heart rate at night and to see if they are any breathing problems occuring at night just to be safe also I will be seeing a doctor who specialize in the electrical system of the heart and have a study done. She seem that something is not right with the electrical system of the heart and feels safe if something was done asap. Due to the fact that I have congenitial heart defect she thinks that there something going on with the electrical system either scar tissue or something she said. She does not want me to wait until June to see cadio so she will talk with him tomorrow and get me in sooner and also schedule with electrophyilogical doctor to have test done. I will let you know more when I get my results.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rosie75 - The thyroid issue is fairly easy to understand in light of the fact that thyroiditis can be an intermittent problem, and is not always recorded as an official diagnosis, at least not the first time it comes under suspicion. It still makes sense so far as the symptoms, but if the labs came back normal then your doctor has to move on to the next logical thing. In this case that move is driven by a concern about V-tach. I don't know  whether you've had any other episodes of possible V-tach, and if you haven't  had any unusual symptoms like the ones you originally described then we're back to square one. An EP study would be the one definitive way to rule in/out any electrical problems  that aren't shown on a resting 12=lead EKG. Even then, if V-tach cannot be induced through the study then there is no life-threatening  problem and you'd probably only be treated with a beta blocker at most, which you are already on.   I'll be very interested to hear how things turn out. Please let us know what happens.\n\n",

I am still tired from yesterday. So I called my cardiologist office this morning and they told me to come in this afternoon. I went and my heart rate was high and he upped my toprol to full 25mg tablet instead of 1/2 tablet. I have to go for stress test next week and holter to find out what's going on and if it shows something he will do eps the next day but if it doesn't he will do eps the first or second week in April. He said something is going on and needs to be taking care of because it putting a strain in my heart. He also put me on 81mg of asprin just to be safe. The fatigue is from my heart working hard because of the rapid rate and palpatations. If my rate goes to 200 or more he wants me to go to the er and will admit me for futher testing. So for now I have to take it easy. If still not feeling well by Fri to call the office and come in. Let you more after next week.\n\n",

It would have been a great explanation, too. The Toprol Dose was pretty low to start with, so the increase may help some while you're waiting to have the tests done. Hopefully this battery of tests will expose the culprit and enable the doctor to help you manage the problem so you can return to normal activity.   We look forward to hearing from you.\n\n",

I been off of it since June 2006, I started taking it in 2004 for gastroparesis due to a virus that I caught. He kept saying something about maybe meds  are causing the problem but I haven't been on meds since. He does not know that I was taking zelnorm back then either. I forgot that I was taking that, the only reason why is that my mother woke me up in the middle of the night when it was on the news and looked in the medicine cabinet and found the bottle. She's concerned about it. I don't want to blame zelnorm but was just wondering can it be?? When he calls me on Monday I will let him know that I took zelnorm in the past. I really don't want to blame zelnorm because it really helped me at that time but can meds do good but do harm later? As soon as I find out more I will keep you posted on the outcome.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rosie - Given the recent, if obscure, suspension of Zelnorm, I think it would be wise for you to mention this to your doctor, more for the record than for anything it may imply about your current problem.   Zelnorm was voluntarily made unavailable until a statistical abnormality in its patient profile could be explained. The abnormality involved a larger-than-normal number of paitients who had taken the drug and then experienced a coronary event of some sort. Please bear in mind that in each such case, the person involved already had a history of coronary artery disease. While this does not sound at all like something that  could be connected with your current problem, it is still well worth recording, since no one yet understands why  this statistical abnormality among Zelnorm patients exists - no one knows by what mechanism, if any, the drug caused the problem. That makes it at least worthy of noting in your chart. It probably is not the cause of your problem, but until the \"bump\" in the number of Zelnorm users with CAD who had subsequent issues is explained, it remains a loose end.   I'm glad you remembered this even though its relationship to your problem seems pretty tenuous right now. By all means do tell your doctor about it. Every potential influence on heart function is worth recording in order to fill out the bigger picture and help figure out what is - and is not - going on.  We look forward to hearing about your doctor's findings.\n\n",

He told me my stress test and holter is normal but have some periods of high heart rate can go up to 200's but everything is normal.

No need to see him. Asked him about the recall and he had no clue to what I am saying and I showed him the paper and he said that it does not pertain to me because I have no history of heart problems and had no surgery in the past to be concern about this zelnorm med. Is he kidding me because  I do have a scar for nothing so it seems to him? I ask him if he wants the paper just incase of other patients and he said no. He does not believe about the zelnorm issue. Why did he ask me if I was taking something and keeps belaming the meds but I wasn't taking anything but now I  tell him about the zelnorm and have no clue? Should I just let this go and seek second opinion? He can not tell me a good reason to why I have periods of  high heart rate but he said that maybe I was excerising while working in the office and doing computer work. Also he said that maybe I know why and to let him know when I know. So basically I am confused and alittle upset about this and my parents want me to seek second opinion should I take this advice?

    "content": "Hello again -  I've been away for a while and am getting caught up and saw this post. I think I can answer part of it (the \"everything's normal but don't stop the toprol\" part), but I also do think it is time for a second opinion, something everyone is entitled to anyway, but sometimes is very important. I think this is one of those times. You could start with a clean slate and have someone work with you and explain what's going on and what appears \"normal\" and what does not.  Remaining on the Toprol seems like a very prudent thing, in part because of your history of nonsustained V-tach, even though the cause is likely already known and everything on your stress test was \"normal.\" I use quote marks because it seems odd that your heart rate got into the 200s, which would almost have to be above your maximum and is at least very unusual I have to assume \"normal\" in this case means no ischemia and no evidence of any corornary artery disease, no malfunction structurally, etc. This is all great, and I would concur with the decision to continue the Toprol, but the heart rate at or above 200 isn't \"normal.\" It may be OK, given all the things the doctor knows, him having been present during the test, but that and a few other things certainly do support your wish for a second opinion. I hope you've gotten one. Please let us know how you're doing.\n\n",

There is also a feeling of discomfort when my heart starts beating regular again. This can go on for hours at a time. I do feel them all day but sometimes they are much worse. My EP told me to restrict my caffeine intake, I don't drink coffee but drink a can of diet pepsi every morning to get me going. He said that PVCs are usually not harmful but in people with Long QT Syndrome like myself they can pose a problem if they occur to much. He is away for the next month and I am wondering if what I am feeling is normal for PVCs or if I should get it checked out in the meantime. Thank you Stevie\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Stevie-  Normally a young, healthy person can tolerate a 4-beat run of V-tach (3-5 PVCs in a row is arbitrarily considered a run of V-tach, although this is a controversial measurement). However, in someone with LQTS it becomes more problematic and while a beta blocker is sometimes effective in preventing these runs, it is of more concern in your case, especially since your son has established, with you, a familial pattern of LQTS, meaning it isn't just acquired due to use of some offensive medication. While the PVC activity you are experiencing would be perfectly acceptable (if terribly annoying) in most healthy people, the fact that you have a familial pattern-based LQTS leaves me feeling that you should be followed more closely, and if your EP  knows about this and has taken  off for a month then  there should be someone covering for him and you definitely shold be in touch with whoever that may be, as it would seem appropriate to consider what more can be done to manage what is a potentially very serious problem.   Many people are subject to increased PVCs and other arrhythmias following ingestion of caffeine, whether contained in coffee or a cola drink, and many of those are willing to put up with the annoyance of the ectopy that usually follows. Caffeine alone will not cause a dangerous arrhythmia in the absence of any abnormality.  LQTS is a distinctive and unique abnormality, however, and since you are aware of frequent and complex PVCs (and probably PACs as well) during the day, given the presence of LQTS, it may be appropriate to seek a second opinion as to the current management plan. The Atenolol may confer adequate protection, but caffeine aside, it doesn't seem to be doing an adequate job of suppressing the PVCs. It is my personal opinion that getting this checked out in the absence of your EP would be appropriate.   Please do stay in touch and let us know if anything new develops.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there - I've been out of town for about a month due to family matters, so am just getting caught up.    What you describe here, incredible as it may seem, is an extremely normal scenario. All people have some PVCs (and PACs too) and some have more than others; some have a lot but are unaware of them. Others feel every single one. So long as there is no serious disease of the left ventricle (in which case there would  be a lot of other  stuff going on that would probably overshadow the PVCs, like chest pain, shortness of breath, a prior  heart attack, etc.), PVCs are almost  always unimportant and rarely of any diagnostic significance. Most importantly, they do no  cause damage to the heart,  although they can be so  pronounced at times that they can be almost painful.  Nope, no wear-and-tear factor despite the fact they feel like it.   Caffeine is one of the biggest causes of frequent  PVCs (also nicotine and sometimes alcohol), but we all  have them at times anyway. The caffeine issue is a matter of personal choice and how much you are willing  to tolerate in exchange for the benefit of using it to get moving. There's no harm in using it, but it will very likely cause you to notice more PVCs than you otherwise would. The trick is to be  able to feel secure in the  knowlege that they won't do you any harm. They won't.  That's the bottom line.   Hope this helps!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi - It really is odd the way those things work, but a lot has to do with the  push-pull relationship between  the sympathetic nervous system, which causes the heart rate to increase,  and the parasympathetic (vagus nerve mainly) which serves as the braking mechanism to slow things down. As all this is going on, with the heart connected somewhere in the middle of those two circuits, it gets involved in ways that feel really strange for some of us. Most any glandular activity can have some effect on it too, which is why the mentrual  cycle can definitely get these things stirred up at certain times. Actually the list of innocent  things that can  cause palpitations and PVCs (and  a few other harmless things) is  as long as one's arm.  One of the really odd but extremely common things on that long list is what you asked about: digestion. Yep,  that's  one and I can tell you exactly why that happens. See, the vagus nerve (major component of the parasympathetic nervous system) not only serves to slow the heart's rate, it also controls many of the functions of digestion, such as the release of stomach acid and the peristalsis (churning) that takes place during digestion. Anything that  causes the vagus nerve to become  active affects all  the  functions, since the nerve is not real intelligent. It just does what  it knows how to do. So when we eat and then sit and digest our food,  the vagus nerve is a major player. Since it also causes the heart  to try and slow during those times, it triggers PVCs naturally in most people. If you have a caffeinated drink with dinner, that makes it all the more noticeable.   There is also a paradoxical effect that happens  at times such as you describe re: taking out the trash. If you've been sittiing and not  having PVCs, getting up and doing something may trigger a few. If you're sensitive to them, you'll really notice them with the  activity and change of posture.  Then again, if you're having them at rest (like after dinner), often getting up and  moving around (taking a walk or whatver) may make them go away. If this works, however, they may well return as soon as you're sitting down again. It doesn't mean anything at all, it's just a side effect of the body's various functions interacting and our noticing it.  It's hard to believe, but some people have every other beat a PVC, as their normal rhythm (it's called bigemeny).  Often when  they are active it goes away, only to return when they are relaxing. When  PVCs are this frequent the person having them rarely even  is aware of them. It's when they are not constant that most of us are startled by them, and  that feeling  of your heart being \"gone\" is just a kind of void feeling that  we suspect is caused because of the early beat  not giving the heart enough time to fill adequately, so it feels  like something has disappeared in  our chest for a moment.It's crazy, but it's also very normal. People tend not to talk to each other  about it too much, usually because it  is difficult  to describe and others tend to look askance. This is unfortunate,  because even those  who aren't bothered by these things are having them at some time or another, whether they feel them or not.\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome! It is often very important to pass along simple reassurance, especially about this subject, since it comes up quite often. I know a lot of doctors  prefer not to \"talk shop\" with their patients for a variety of reasons, but I've worked with some fine doctors over the years, including some very distinguished cardiologists, and the best of them always try to explain the peculiar nature of PVCs because it is such a common problem and so much anxiety could be avoided if the  patient understood that they are almost never significant and that we all have them at some time or other. The reason I know a good deal about the subject is that I have a long history of involvement in emergency medicine, dating back to the late 1960's, and began to learn a lot about cardiac arrhythmias back then when I was chosen as part of  the original staff of the first paramedical pilot project in the state of Maryland, known as The Heartmobile. Not long after that I co-founded the first fire department EMS division in the state. I've worked as a cardiology tech and in cardiac rehab, and studied a great deal (for personal reasons) about electrophysiology (the specialty involving cardiac arrhythmias). I worked with one of the best EP doctors in the west for a number of years. I've just been very fortunate in that regard and am convinced that a little knowlege and reassurance can often help to alieve tremendous anxiety, because PVCs can be very scary or at least feel very strange.   I could try and give you at least a partial list of potential benign causes of PVCs (there are a very few serious  causes, and they usually have more bothersome symptoms that  overshadow them). Some of the more common ones are:  - Digestion and digestive upset - Onset of a viral infection - Anxiety or stress - Respiratory disease - Use of caffeine, tobacco or nicotine - Use of many recreational drugs, especially marijuana and methamphetamines - Any number of prescription drugs - Mitral valve prolapse - Stress - Sleep deprivation or disturbance - Alcohol use - Inhalation of volatile fumes (ie- airplane glue) - Anything which stimulates the vagus nerve - Fatigue and/or sleepiness - Lying on the left side at bedtime ... and the list goes on and on. Sometimes there is no apparent reason for them, also. It is just the nature of the heart to backfire from time to time.   There is at least one book, by Dr. John Barlow, who has done some of the most important work regarding mitral valve prolapse, which contains a complete list of potential triggers. I can't remember the name of the book now. I came across it at the US National Institutes of Health a long while back. I think the list above is pretty comprehensive.  You are in very good company. We get this question very often here, and also hear it frequently in the ER, as many people, not knowing what is going on, panic and wind up visiting there, where they are told not to worry about it. A brief explanation, I believe, might save a lot of people a great deal of anxiety, since \"don't worry about it\" just leaves too many loose ends.   I'm happy that you feel reassured by this information and thanks for utilizing the site. Best of health to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there - Nope, you're definitely not crazy. This is something that few people realize: the connection between the vagus nerve, the heart and the digestive tract. The vagus nerve (parasympathetic nervous system, the side that acts as a brake on the heart's rate of beating as opposed to the sympathetic, which speeds it up) is also responsible, in great part, for the rumbling and grumblings of our stomach and intestines. Anything which might make the gut growl (like a bowel movement) also stimulates the vagus nerve, which then carries the signal back to the brain \"mission accomplished.\" Since it branches to the heart, and anything that stimulates the vagus can be interpreted as a signal to try and slow the heart, that's what happens. The heart slows anyway if there is any straining at stool; if the gut is rumbling at this time there often is no need to strain, but the vagus is still stimulated. At average or higher heart rates the attempt to slow it by the vagus nerve often results in \"backfires\" - PVCs. It is common, normal, and not usually a problem beyond the annoying or sometimes scary sensation it causes and the fact that it seems so unrelated to what is going on at the time. In fact, any time the heart rate slows - from deep relaxation to sleep to a change in activity - the is a potential for PVCs to happen. There's no deeper meaning to it.   Just as taking and holding a deep breath can slow the heart rate and often cause PVCs at the same time, so can straining, and so can the involuntary growling and grumbling of an active stomach or gut.   So no, you're not crazy. In fact, you're quite normal! It's just not something one hears about a lot because it doesn't always happen, many people are unaware it is happening when it does, and few people would bring it up in ordinary conversation anyway.   Hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Well Hello again! Good to hear from you,  and I'm sorry your palpitations have found a new way to unnerve you, but that's how that seems to work; if you are reassured about once sort of presentation, eventually they find some new way to disturb you. (And by \"you\" I mean anyone who is bothered by them, not just you). What you describe is something I've heard from any number of people, and there are three things that commonly can cause that rapid, pounding on change of position: one is  just plain sinus tachycardia. That's too easy, though. There also is the possibility that all of your premature beats are not PVCs, but are mixed with (or even entirely) PACs or even junctional premature beats. While these are even less of a concern than PVCs, when they come all in a row like that, rather fast, it feels pretty unpleasant. It is likely a tachycardia (meaning a heart rate of more than 100 beats per minute) and the origin of it is what is in question. Change of position -- such and bending, stooping, etc., can trigger any of the premature beats, but especially PVCs and PACs. The latter can  sometimes come in a flurry, which is then known as a brief burst of SupraVentricular Tachycardia (SVT), any tachycardia which originates above the ventricles. This is very common (aren't you tired of hearing that?) and can be triggered by position change or by nothing in particular. It is very startling, but short bursts of it are not nearly as frightening (although harmless) as when it is sustained, and some people periodically get this for minutes, hours or days at a time! Then something needs to be done to control it, because it can become mentally and physically exhausting. But short bursts such as you may have experienced are common and  not a real problem -- except that it is startling and nervous making.   It is also possible, although not as likely,  that this is a series of PVCs. Non-stustained ventricular tachycardia can happen on occasion, caused by the same triggers that set off a single PVC. In an otherwise healthy heart even this is no longer considered much of a problem, although if it happens often enough to really bother the patient sometimes a beta blocking drug is  suggested. In  random samples of otherwise healthy people there are frequent short bursts of both SVT and V-tach, neither of which are considered dangerous. If they happen too often and make the patient very anxious then a beta blocking drug like a slow-release metaprolol, can be prescribed, and often will reduce or eliminate the runs of whatever it is. It can even be what's called junctional tachycardia, which is probably the  least concerning of all the tachycardias,  but there is usually no treatment recommended.   The important thing to remember is that so long as your heart is otherwise healthy and electrically normal, some people are just more prone to any number of arrhythmias, including what you have described. It can be terriby annoying, and if it becomes a frequent occurence it wouldn't hurt to let your doctor know about it, but usually even these episodes, unless they are accompanied by lightheadedness, are of no consequence.   I sure hope this helps to reassure you. Take care and do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again -  While I've been away for a while, this thread also went onto another page, so I didn't see this post til just now.  Can you tell me which valve is affected? It is a mild leak, so that's probably not a really bad thing. Many people have one or more mild valve leaks and never need surgery. I suspect the doctor meant there's nothing to be done at this time (now \"that\" time, I guess) and may not be anything that needs to be done. It is scary, especially when the physician doesn't have the time to answer all the questions, and most especially when the questions come to you a few minutes after you've left the office.   A lot would depend on which valve has the mild leak and what, if anything, seems to be causing it (as I said, many people have mildly leaky valves for no particular reason). A lot of those people are quite young, too, as you are. Age doesn't necessarily have anything to do with it. The only thing I would suggest, and I'm sure your doctor has this covered, is that the valve should probably be checked annualy or maybe every six months, with an echocardiogram every year or two. The only exception to this would be if some new symptoms appeared, in which case the same thing would just be done sooner.   In all likelihood, given what you've told me, you shouldn't need surgery for a long  time, if ever. Of course that's based on what I know, which isn't much at this point.    Please do follow up and let us know if you've learned more about this problem since your post. I'm here on a regular basis now, so you will get an answer.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  I know of no studies correlating altitude (or lack of it) and atrial fibrillation. In fact, in the majority of cases there is no clear reason why it happens. It does need to be converted or controlled by  one of several possible methods, but if there is no pulmonary disease (chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease or fibrotic lung disease, two of the few things known to be associated with the onset of A-fib) then it's just going to have to be addressed when it starts up. Hopefully it can be managed with electrical cardioversion and/or oral medication. If not, there are other things that can be done, but it does have to be controlled to prevent the formation of clots in the atria, which can then break loose, find their way to the brain and cause a stroke. A-fib in and of itself is not life-threatening, but the tendency for clots to form during sustained A-fib is why it is considered a serious problem. It also doesn't always feel very good while it's going on, although some patients are completely unaware it is happening.   I hope this answers your question.\n\n",

    "content": "Im 34 yr old male and for the last 6 months have had almost daily pvc's, somewhere to the tune of 6-10 per minute. I will have them all day long and on occasion they will just stop for no reason for a couple days. Then begin again for who knows how long. I have visisted the ER once and they ran the regular tests and they were determined to beign. I have also done a stress test and and Echo both came out normal and I had an EF of 61. I also seem to have very mild shortness of breath Im not sure if this is related or just cause Im very out of shape. I should note that I chew nicorette alot and don't drink much fluids by habit so Im sure im dehydrated most the time. My question is there a point where an individual should be on medication to suppress these? I understand that there is a risk of Cardiomyopathy if you have alot of them. I paranoid of taking pills and want to avoid this as much as possible however im having thousands of these a day which kinda sucks. Its not disrupting life but it is bothersome and its hard to believe that im not going to just going to keel over sometime. I can not determine a trigger for these its so random I might have 3 a min or ten I wish I new what was going on so I could make an adjustment and suppress these without medication. Since I have had the stress and echo does that mean I need to find somthing better to do with my life then worry about these?  Thanks for the help  Jason\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Frequent PVC's",
    "content": "Hello -  First, PVCs are the most common arrhythmia in both healthy and diseased hearts. They are common in almost everyone, occurring either occasionally or frequently, or, as in your case, sporadically. They can come and go, stay for weeks or months, go away for the same periods of time, and absent any structural heart disease, have no diagnostic or prognostic significance. While it is true that people with cardiomyopathy often have PVCs, so do normal people, so they are not a risk factor for this problem, and you have had all the appropriate tests to rule out this problem anyway, so that becomes a non-issue. What is left is a bunch of very annoying premature beats. If you are able to accept them as a normal abnormality and something that everyone has (but only some people are aware of -- others have them non-stop and don't even know it) then you will likely relax about it and not become overly concerned to the point that you become chronically anxious. This latter would be a much more serious problem than the PVCs by a mile.   Also, you mentioned you chew nicorette, so you are getting a daily dose of nicotine (and congratulations for getting it via the gum instead of by smoking) and nicotine, along with caffeine, are two of the top causes of more frequent PVCs than whatever your baseline number would be.  The worst thing about PVCs is the patient's perception of them. As I mentioned, some people never even feel them, but others feel every single one, and  if they are not understood as benign, one can become terribly anxious about them, which can do a lot more psychological damage while doing no physical harm.  I assure you, you've had cardiomyopathy ruled out by your echocardiogram and stress test. You've also ruled out any current coronary artery disease. you have a healthy heart. Keep it that way by healthy diet, a regular exercise routine, maintaining a proper weight and above all by not resuming smoking (I assume you are a former smoker and don't just chew Nicorette for the buzz). But for now you just have PVCs because, well, because you have them. Practically everyone does. That's important to remember.   If the PVCs become a terrible bother to you there are medical  ways to reduce the frequency and perceived forcefulness of them, but medication for a benign condition should be a last resort for people who have major anxiety problems because of the palpitations they feel. If you can avoid this whole area you'll be better off.  To answer your final question, yes. You can probably find something better to do than  worry about this. Not always as easy to do as to say, but if you can set them aside and move on, that would be idea. Also, for some people, exercise actually makes them go away, at least while exercising. Just a thought.  I hope this has helped. You're fine. Enjoy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 38 yr. old female, healthy, exercise daily and have recently been to my cardiologist for my holter monitor results.   I was told what I have is not a matter of life or death, but was given a prescription for Sectral 200 mg. in the morning, and 200 mg. at night.  The cardiologist said I have extra heart beats, they were continual for 3 months, never stopped and from the Holter monitor results, it showed that my average heart beats per minute were 92.  The doctor said it was on the high side of \"average\" so he wanted me on the beta blocker to lower that.  My question is, I am an active person, always up and moving, cleaning, exercising, taking care of 2 kids, etc...the usual daily activities, rarely just sit down and watch tv or anything like that.  Could that be why my heart rate is averaging 92 bpm along w/the extra beats I've been having?  Do I really need to be on a beta blocker?  Also, I have had awful side effects w/the sectral... I had drowsiness, insomnia and while I was awake all night, had extreme nervousness or anxiety, restlessness.  This continued on into the next day so bad that  I couldn't go in and eat at a restaurant.  I do not have a history of anxiety attacks, so I'm sure it's from the beta blocker.  I was only on it for 2 days, I called the doctor and the nurse told me to cut the dose in half, so I took the morning dose, but it continued on into the next 2 days also...I've read that you cannot just stop taking this medicine, so I was wondering what can happen from stopping taking this medicine after only being on it for 4-5 days,or are those warnings more for people who are on a high dose for a longer period of time?  I'd rather be off of it, and go through the extra heart beat from time to time than these side effects.  My previous history w/the extra beats, is just here and there maybe 2 or 3 times a year that I noticed, but recently it was non-stop...for 3 months or so.  It has since gone back to a normal beat...the cardiologist did say that in a couple of months, I won't need to be on it anymore, but I'm ready to stop now.  Thank you for your help...\n\n",

    "title": "Re: beta blocker side effects",
    "content": "Hello cat512 -  Several things can be said, and I think you've intuited most of them already. First, premature beats (in your case very likely premature ventricular contractions -- PVCs, the most common arrhythmia and also the most \"normal\" one) occur in just about everyone at some time or other. Sometimes they are frequent as in your case, sometimes they occur sporadically or rarely. They are almost never of any diagnostic or prognostic value and are almost never dangerous, certainly not in an otherwise healthy, young person with no heart disease.   Further, even in people with heart disease they are rarely treated anymore. About 15 years ago it was still common practice to try and make them go away, and Sectral was the first beta blocker approved for this specific purpose. Sectral (acebutolol) is a unique beta blocker in that it possesses intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). This means that while, like other beta blockers, it will slow your heart rate, it also stimulates it at the same time, so the net result is a less-slowed rate than with other beta blockers. When it was realized that there is little to no benefit from trying to obliterate PVCs and actually some disadvantages, Sectral became something of an \"orphan\" drug. It is rarely prescribed anymore. Only someone using the old standards for PVCs would even think of prescribing it. I am very surprised that a currently practicing cardiologist would prescribe this drug unless you were complaining about the  premature beats, and apparently you were not. If there had been a valid need to slow your heart rate, Sectral would not have been the best beta blocker for that purpose.  Further, the normal sinus heart rate is defined as anywhere between 60 and 100 beats per minute. This \"normal\" of course varies from one patient to the next. Some are on the slower end of the spectrum, many in the middle, and some on the high end. An average rate of 92 for an active adult is pretty unremarkable.  In some people,  especially petite females, it would be totally unremarkable. As for the PVCs, this could be due to caffeine, nicotine, the adrenaline release of a stressful, active lifestyle, or just peculiar to certain people. It's not, in itself, anything to be overly concerned by. Even in an acute setting now, say, in someone hospitalized with a heart attack, it is far less common to treat PVCs, where once it was considered very important. Again, in a healthy person, they are meaningless. There can also be premature atrial contractions (next most popular) and they are just as inoccuous. They tend to feel pretty similar to PVCs, at least in patients who are aware of them.  On the other hand, acebutolol (Sectral) does have, in certain patients,  some unpleasant side effects precisely of the sort you describe. Given that it is almost never  important to treat PVCs anyway (except to the degree that they bother the patient who actually feels them), Sectral would no longer be a good choice, and it is no longer usual to treat them in any healthy patient who does not have a specific problem with palpitations (the perception of premature beats). Your average heart rate of 92 is certainly not by itself any sort of medical concern. So you are correct to question the value of this therapy in your case.   You are also aware of the one precaution about stopping beta blocker therapy, and if you did stop after 4-5 days you would probably have not experienced any \"rebound\" effect. After a few weeks it is necessary to taper off gradually, but with twice-a-day dosing you'd already halved the dose anyway, so if you stopped I'm sure you had no problems. Hopefully one way or the other you've discontinued the drug by now, as it was a very unusual choice.   I hope you will follow up with us here, and that everything is well with you.\n\n",

    "title": "single PVC during exercise",
    "content": "Hello,  I am a healthy 25 year old female, no medications, no family history of heart disease, and I have been having PVCs for the past 4-7 years. Sometimes I go weeks without having them, and I find right before my period I get more, like one or two a day. I had an episode 14 months ago where I was getting them every 15 minutes, went to the ER, they recorded PVCs, and this lasted for about 2 days, after which they subsided. At that point I cut out all caffeine (I think the big cup of coffee I had that time brought them on), and I think that has been helpful in reducing my PVCs to almost none, except if I am upset, or PMSing. There is one other exception: I often get a single PVC during cardio exercise. This has been going on for the 4-7 years, perhaps every time or every other time I do any type of strenuous activity (cardio machines, hiking uphill, running outside).   After the ER visit I had an echo done (where they record the sounds of the heart and take the video-like image similar to how you view babies in the womb, sorry if I am using the wrong term). Everything came back normal, so I am assuming my heart is structurally sound. I had a fever when they took the exam, I think my pulse might have been around 100 (maybe less), so I don't know if that would have impacted the results in any negative way.  Ever since then I have had no problems, other than an occasional single PVC during the day, and a single PVC when I exercise, perhaps every other time I exercise (I try to exercise about 5 days a week, 45 minutes a day). I find that the exercise PVCs happen when I am hiking and going uphill, and tired, or I am running and tired - basically at times when I might have been going \"too hard\", even though I try not to let my heart rate go above 165 when I am at a gym machine and can record it. Perhaps 165 is too high for a 45 minute workout? Sometimes they happen when I don't feel tired, but maybe I don't realize how much I am working out. When I get them an I'm outside hiking or running I'm sure my heart is going over 175 because those hills are tough!  Anyway, I am wondering if I should bother to go back and get a stress test done. I have read that exercise-induced arrythmias are a cause for concern, but I am not sure if that is only true because they are a marker for underlying heart disease. I don't think I am going to drop dead, because this has been going on for so long, but I don't want to do any damage. I love working out, and I enjoy the tough workouts, but maybe they are bad for my heart? Perhaps a heart rate of 165 is just too high for a 45 minute workout? My resting pulse is between 45 and 55.  I have terrible anxiety, but since I cut out caffeine my panic attacks are very infrequent (ironically, going through caffeine withdrawl for a week increased the panic attacks during that time!). I feel like every time my heart gets \"excited\", like when I am upset, I get a PVC. My theory on the exercise-induced single PVC is that something changes in the blood composition during exercise, perhaps a release of adrenaline or a temporary reduction in oxygenation, resulting in a single PVC until the body adjusts. But I am not a doctor :-)  Is there a difference between exercise-induced PVCs and normal PVCs, and are they a cause for concern, if they are so infrequent? And my echo a year ago came back normal? Am I exercising too hard? What could be causing them during exercise? Should someone who gets PVCs keep their heart rate below a certain number during exercise because of their 'defective heart'?  Sorry for the incredibly long post! Thank you in advance!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: single PVC during exercise",
    "content": "Hi,  At 25, your target heart rate on exercise would come to 220-25=195. Which means you are not exerising beyound the limit.  PVCs are premature ventricular contarctions. Most often they are physiological. There would hardly be an individual on this globe who have never had a PVC. Adrenalin is the hormone which is responsible for the trigger. Adrenalin increases force of contractions and reduces the refractory period of the heart mucsle, at the same time stimulates the surrogate pace makers of the conducting system like AV node, His Bundle, Bundle branches and cardiac myosite itself. Stress also increases chances of PVC through adrenalin.  There are formulated criteria to define which PVCs are 'physiological' and which are abnormal, or dangerous. PVCs less than 6 a minute are considered benign and not requiring treatment. PVCs occuring single as against in pairs of twos or threes [salvos] are benign. Salvos are always dangerous and to be treated immediately. PVCs occurring very close to the preceding T wave of the cardiac cycle are dangerous. PVCs, though single but of different morphology, [multifocal] are not benign. PVCs in the setting of a 'Heart Attack' or a Cogestive Cardiac failure are NEVER benign.  Your exercise is well within acceptable range, occasional PVC occuring during exercise in never a concern. You are not wirking out excessively. The only thing you are doing in excess is being Anxious! Anxiety will invite adrenalin remember. So do not pay any attention to the PVCs, concentrate on exercise and your other daily activity.   Take care,   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again,  Thank you for the response. I keep getting fewer and fewer PVCs as I learn to be less anxious. I've also found, that the LESS exercise I do, the fewer I get, which is odd but not a very good excuse to quit the gym ;-)   I actually have another question which is not directly related to the PVCs, but since I have my history here, it would be better I just ask with that data available. My dad has high blood pressure and recently bought a BP+HR monitor. We were trying it out at home yesterday night, and it said my BP was 90/50 with a pulse of 40! I have had my pulse in the 50s for a couple of years, but this surprised me. It seems too low to be justified by the exercise I do weekly (cardio 4-5 times a week for 50 minutes). I don't really have any symptoms of dizziness or fainting, only when I stand up suddenly, but that has been going on all my life. My only symptom seems to be anxiety ;-) Just curious if you had any comments about such a slow pulse. When I exercise it routinely gets up to 165. I was planning to take some sleeping medication for an overseas flight in 2 weeks (OTC Unisom), but with a pulse so low, is that a good idea?  Thanks again!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi EXPANDER,  Premature Ventricular Contractions [PVCs] are a common phenomenon. The range of the severity of these varies. Adverse outcomes from the PVCs can result from following situations:  1.\tMultiple, multifocal PVCs with more than 12-15 a minute. Multifocal means PVCs with different configuration on ECG. 2.\t\u2018R on T\u2019 phenomenon. Meaning the R wave of the PVC is so close to the previous beat that it has a chance to fall on the T wave of that previous beat. If this happens a life threatening arrhythmia called Ventricular Tachycardia will result. 3.\tSalvos or Runs of PVCs. More than one coming consecutively. 4.\tPVCs associated with angina and exercise. 5.\tPVCs associated with Hypokalemia [low potassium] or Hypercalcemia [high calcium]. These electrolyte imbalance needs to be corrected immediately. 6.\tPVCs in the setting of an acute heart attack or an acute Coronary Syndrome [ACS] 7.\tPVCs that cause a hemodynamic impairment- fall of BP, syncope, fainting etc.   As far as treatment of PCVs is concerned, many of the antiarrhythmic drugs have recently come under a cloud due to their side effects and increase in overall mortality. You will be surprised to know that one of the most common side effects of many anti-arrhythmic agents is arrhythmia!   Only two anti arrhythmic agents are currently in favor of cardiologists world wide and they are Beta blockers [preferably metoprolol] and Amiodarone. Again Amiodarone has a tendency to cause thyroid dysfunction and more seriously Pulmonary fibrosis in the long run. You already are on a beta blocker.  You may discuss out these data with your cardiologist and then decide whether you should take anti arrhythmic treatment or not.   Apurva\n\n",

About I month ago I started having palpitations and tacyness of the heart which I have had palps in the past several yrs ago , but found out my potassium was always low I have been on 10 meq daily for 8 yrs of that with 250 mg magnesium. I had a holter that stated only that my avrage beat was 84 but also had sinus tacy at 144 beats pr min. I then had a echo because this just got worse it said I had a Equivocal anterior mitral leaflet prolapse and trace Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.  The ejection fraction was 60 to 65 percent. The right ventricular systolic pressure was 27 mmhg.  I also was admitted wwhen I went to the ER cause I felt a little pain in the chest they had me on the tele monitor and it said in the report that they saw the palpitations and that i occasionally had a slow atrial rythym. When I was in there and I said that I had a funny feeling in the chest they ran a strip and the girls told me it wads inverted p waves that were junctional. Not sure that the dr was told, I think I told him when he did the stress test on me. That test was fine, I was running a low bp at like 79/56 and when I  got up to do the test after sitting and standing it went up tp 80/60. I have been feeling a little light headed ck my pulse it will be like 60 or a little lower, I am afraid to take anything for my anexiety that it will make my pressure and pulse go lower, but its driving me crazy!!!!! I just worry about the heart beat without the meds going to low while I sleep , they never said how low it went, but i also still have periods of the tacyness, not bad today and the palpitations are not bad today either. When I was discharged they told me to stop taking the thyroid med if I wanted I did 3 days ago and to take more potsssiummj, but mine was not out of range at all. This was my diagnosis. I am so worried about the echo results and what the tele monitor had said about my slow rythym.  There were some nuetro and monos that were off in my blood work and my INR was low at a 1 when rgular range is 2-3, I asked the dr about this he said it was not low  when it said it right there on the lab test, they did a ct scan to make sure that I did not have a clot in my lung that night. Should I be to worried about these results of the echo and the heart rythyms? Or am I just working my self up?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Gyrlemt,  In my view you ARE a little anxious about your health though I do not deny that you have some issues with your heart rhythm. I will try here to give you some information which I hope will ameliorate your anxiety.  First your Thyroid. You were on 50 mics and the fact that it was started in the first place means that your hypothyroid status was well documented. Means you are to be on the med continuously and cannot stop it. OK the dose may vary from time to time but its not possible to discontinue in most of the cases.   Your Echo says you have equivocal Mitral Prolapse. This is a condition in which the flaps of the Mitral valve of your heart would be a little longer than needed and the two flaps would 'skid' on each other when they close during systole just like a bike skidding on a wet road. This may sound scary but believe me it is not. This is the most benign or innocent of the heart 'diseases' in fact many people refuse to call it a disease and prefer to label it as a variation. Your ejection fraction of 60-65 is excellent.  However those having this MV Prolapse are prone to get arrhythmias-or irregularity of their heart beats. Your rate of 144 may well be due to this added by some anxiety. You had a run of junctional rhythm too as you say.  Now these rhythms although not desirable are not too serious too. Your low blood pressure is also a function of your Mitral Prolapse syndrome.   To overcome all these things I have some suggestions for you.   First and foremost get your thyroid profile done. If thyroid is on higher side, [low TSH] your are bound to have some heart rhythm disturbances.   Second, start doing some regular and vigorous aerobic exercises. This will build up your stamina, tone up your heart, increase your vagal tone and ultimately reduce or eliminate the rhythm disturbances. Point out the Junctional rhythm thing to your cardiologist.   Eat a lot of fresh citrus food and vegetables. Thus you will get your potassium the natural way. Its more enjoyable to eat an orange than to eat a potassium pill isn't it?  Your INR of 1 is absolutely normal, rest assured about it. INR of 2-3 as you say is only for those who have a metal valve fitted and are taking some clot reducing medicines.   Take care,   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "I have been having this chest pain for over 2 weeks and also skipped beat most of the time. I have gone to see a doctor and did a blood test for thyroid, potassium, sodium count. Also a chest x-ray. It seems that everything is ok and the doctor said my health is in good condition. Maybe the chest pain and palpitation are caused by stress and anxiety. My concern is, is it related to the supplement that I took since 2 months ago? The supplement is for metabolism booster and energy. It contains these items: Calcium, dried green tea extract, dried ginger extract, dried theobroma cacao extract, dried yerba mate extract,celery, fennel, licorice, marshmallow, parsley, suma, dried cinnamon extract, alfalfa and caffeine ( 80 mg from natural caffeine & 4 mg from herbal blend). I have stopped taking this supllement 2 weeks ago after I experienced the chest pain and the skipped beat. Is there any medication to stop the skipped beat? Please advice since the palpitation and chest pain really bothers me right now.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  The herbal supplement that you have been taking contains theobromine and caffeine as per your question. Both of these substances are known to stimulate the heart and cause premature atrial contractions [PAC]. These PACs are mostly benign but they do cause a sensation of palpitation in a person.   In addition liquorice has a tendency to cause high blood pressure.  Now that you have stopped the supplement, the effect is bound to ware off. However it is advisable to see your physician and if he feels so get an EKG done.  Apurva.\n\n",

    "content": "I would greatly appreciate your help on this matter.  I'm a 20 year old female of healthy weight. I exercise regularly and do not smoke. I have a history of SVT. I had an ablation 6 yrs ago and have periodic episodes of irregular heart beats since then. That's not my concern.  I was recently sent to the ER (pretty much against my will) due to a heart rate of 170 bpm. I felt completely normal while my heart was beating rapidly and was not in any sort of distress nor had I taken any stimulents. I do not have abnormal thyroid levels as they tested me at the ER.  I was given two shots of adenosine which didn't help and a shot of something else which lowered my heart rate immediately.  My EKG said that I was in sinus tach (165 bpm) which isn't really anything to worry about but it also said that I had a nonspecific repolarization abnormality, difuse leads. What does that mean?  A fellow nursing student noticed a high-pitched whooshing sound in the right side of my neck and it sort of feels like it's vibrating. I've been told it's probably a bruit but that's it. I've listened to it on my own stethescope and it almost sounds like a whining background noise or like a swarm of bees buzzing. This is the reason for my concern and the reason I'm writing in. If you could PLEASE answer this email as soon as you can I would be forever grateful.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Reasons for fast heart rates are many. One of them is SVT which you had and got ablated 6 yrs back. Another is Sinus Tachycardia which you recently had. Both are quite different in nature.   S. Tachycardia generally unlikely to respond to Adenosine. S. tachcardia will many times show some non specific repolarisation changes on ECG. These are perfectly okay and has no significance.  Humming or wooshing sound on the neck can be a Plaque in the carotid artery causing a carotid Bruit, a transmitted murmur from the aortic valve, a continuous murmur of an AV malformation or a local bruit due to Hyperthyroidism. In context of your S. Tachycardia, you must rule out hyperthyroidism. In addition some tests like carotid doppler, echocardiogram etc will selttle the matter if your doctor thinks they are required.  Take care,   Apurva\n\n",

The last couple of days I have had alot of PAC's and today I had an episode where I squatted down to clean up a spill and my heart started beating super fast and pounding. I had to bear down to stop the episode that lasted for about 45 seconds. I have had these on several occasions before but want to know if the two are related? My cardiologist says im totally healthy.

    "content": "Hi,  Skipping of heart beats is a common phenomenon. Most of these skipped beats are benign, having no clinical significance. At the most they cause some thud in the chest and anxiety in the mind. However this anxiety itself sometimes may prove to be a problem like in your case.   PACs are surely a benign form of missed beats. They are there with anxiety, stress, unpleasant situation and febrile illness. Some times, these PACs come in a series and then it causes a prolonged flutterish feel in the chest and a fast pulse. This is either a 'run of PACs' or it might even be a 'SVT-supra ventricular tachycardia'.   In my opinion all you need is some reassurance, an anti anxiety medicine some regular physical exercise to build up your heart's vagal tone and a consult with your cardiologist just to be sure about the diagnosis.  Take care,  Apurva.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Doctors!  First off, thanks for taking the time to help out & read my question.  I'm a 23 year old female with hypothyroidism, PCOS, high blood pressure (just diagnosed about a week ago, do not yet know the cause), & pre-diabetic.  I weigh 325 & am 5'4.  I have come down from 363 in the past 6 months.  I have never had any health problems before, until again the past 6 months when I started trying to lose weight I started to experience things.  I have since been diagnosed with all of the above.  I take synthroid (50), Buspar for anxiety (5), & vasotec for the high bp starting yesterday.  (2/11/08)  Okay so now that you know my history, here is my question.  The whole reason I even went to see a Physician 6 months ago was because I was having some uncomfortable & repetitive heart palpitations or flutters.  That's when I was diagnosed with the hypothyroidism.  Since then, without going into way too much detail, I have had many other problems that have lead to all of the above diagnoses.  But recently (I'd say about the past month) My heart palpitations seem to have been getting worse.  I know I have anxiety & that can cause them, I know i have hypothyroidism & that can cause them, but I have been having so many of them (probably at least 3 to 5 a minute) that it is worrying me.  I have never been scared of my health all of these recent problems came along.  It is a true wake up call.  Is there any advice on these palpitations?  I am calling a cardiologist that I saw a while back today, but want to know what to ask him.  Also, so that I don't just go ask another question in a different forum, could you possiby tell me what could cause high blood pressure in a 23 year old.  Is it just my weight?  I am trying very hard to get it down, but I just want to know what could possibly be the cause if NOT my weight.  If it's that, then I guess I have my answer lol.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Palpitation is a thump or flutter like sensation in the chest. This has several causes. 1) Excitement. The heart pumps vogorously and hence the palpitation. 2)Anxiety. Same reason. 3) Arrhythmia. Due to irregular heart rhythm one gets a feeling of palpitation.  It is HYPER thyroidism that causes the palpitations and not HYPO thyroidism. However when one takes Synthroid, it increases the level of thyroid hormone in the blood and if the dose is proving too high one may land up with hyperthyroidism which in turn can cause palpitations.   Yes, your weight is one big important cause of your hypertension. However at your age other causes of hypertension are kidney or hormone diseases. I am sure your physician must have ruled these out before putting you on anti hypertensive treatment.  Bye,  Apurva.\n\n",

Aphetamine is not likely to aggravate SVT though, if the SVT is properly diagnosed and controlled with appropriate medicies and ablation therapy if needed. However patients of SVT should not take ADHD medicines without consulting their cardiologist first.

There can be some fluttering feelings due to the heart but typically the pulse would be elevated or irregular.  It may be that you are having some twitching of the pectoral muscles of the chest wall.  Most likely this is harmless but it is a good idea to see your doctor and have your electrolytes evaluated.  Rarely, an electrolyte abnormality such as low potassium or low calcium can cause these twitching episodes.  Best wishes.\n\n",

In addition to the palpitations I have pain and weakness on the left side of my body.   A few months ago I noticed my heart woudl skip a beat and then snap back hard which would seem to happen when I was sitting and would cause me to feel out of breath. I went to the ER, had an ECG done which caught the skipped beat and was told I get PVC's and that I should ignore them. My blood work all came back normal. I have also had a stress test which was normal.  Recently, I have been getting chest pain just below my collar bone, as well as, an increase in the PVCs. The pain increases when I push on the spot where it occurs. I had X-rays done which showed that I have straightening of the upper spine (neck) and my neck leans to the left. My question is can the increase in PVCs be nerve related? The increase in frequency seems to be accompanied by muscle pain (or weakness). The PVCs are difficult to ignore so I would like to know if there is anything I can do relieve them.\n\n",

The pain is classically reproduced by pressing on the area.  I am a bit concerned about your PVC's.  When PVC's begin to increase there may be something that is developing and causing the PVC's to increase.  If your pain is related to costochondritis it is unlikely to be related to your PVC's  I would strongly recommend you follow up with your doctor about these PVC's to see if further work up is needed.

I get so scarred that I get panic attacks which make me feel even worse.I have been thru so much in the last 1 1/2 yrs. Every doctor has diagnosised me with anxiety. They tell me that i'm just too overly stressed since Im a single mom of 2 kids, work full time & go to college part time. I also was diagnosised with hyperthyroidism in which i have been taking medication now for 5 months. Then back in april I started getting severe stomach pain which lead too me getting my gallbladder taken out. Comes too find out I never had gallstones, its all a big mess. Im still having severe stomach pain but have not been diagnosised.  I am currently taking a beta blocker for the chest pain/arrhythmias but don't feel any better. Im also taking anxiety meds which help at times. I have an appt in 3 days with my cardio to see what tx is next. Im so scarred and havent been feeling like my normal self for soo long. I just want to  feel my best but nothing is really working for me.I also have trouble sleeping at nite all the time since my rapid heart beat/shortness of breath wakes me up.. Does anyone have any advice for?? Help......[/i]\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Yessie,  Your abdominal pain may be unrelated to your heart/breathing issues.  I would suggest you see a GI doctor about your pain.  This may be a gastritis or ulcerations.  I would recommend you be tested for a bacteria called H. pylori that can cause gastritis or ulcers.  Regarding your chest pains, I would recommend you follow up with your cardiologist.  I am wondering if your beta blocker is sufficiently controlling your arrhythmia if your symptoms have not improved once you started it.  Also, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can both lead to problems with the heart rhythm and breathing (more so with hyperthyroidism) so it is important to be sure that your thyroid levels are normal now that you are on treatment for this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My 70 year old sister, who is in otherwise good health and very active began experiencing intolerance to even light activities about two months ago.  Her primary physician referred to her a cardiologist after  she 'flunked' a treadmill test.  In the few minutes she was on the treadmill, her heart rate dropped  and she was unable to continue on the treadmill.  She was referred  to a cardiologist.  The cardiologist said she had a Mobitz 2  heart block and would have to have a pacemaker.  Her tolerance to activity continues to decrease.   Example:  making the bed in the morning induces weakness, light-headedness, etc and she will lay down  for a while to regain the ability to continue. She also has minor 'self-diagnosed' symptoms of GRD. <smile>  Questions: \tHow long can the placement of a Pacemaker be reasonably and safely delayed?  Weeks? Months?  \tWould it be best to do further tests  to determine the underlying cause  of this arryhthmia before proceeding with the pacemaker?  Namely,  rule out  ischemic heart disease/ CAD by doing such things as a Persantine Test and/or an angiogram?  If the underlying cause of the Mobitz ll was CAD and that was treated,  would it negate the need for a pacemaker?  Thank you for your advice and opinons.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dentaybow,  When reading my opinion please keep in mind that I am not a cardiologist.  It sounds like your sister is quite symptomatic from her cardiac rhythm.  I would suspect that she needs the pacemaker.    I am not qualified to comment on the need for angiography.  A persantine test may give helpful information regarding the presence of coronary artery disease but may not be particularly helpful regarding the need to have a pacemaker placed.  My best advice is to discuss this with her cardiologist to get the benefits and risks of the pacemaker as well as not getting the pacemaker.  This way you'll be able to make an informed decision.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jabarra777,  I apologize for the delay in responding to your post.  Unfortunately, I cannot give you an absolute opinion about your holter report because I am not a cardiologist.  I can tell you what I know, though.  There are some reassuring things seen on your holter tracings.  First, there is not ST depression.  ST depression is an early indicator of heart ischemia.  It's presence would indicate that there is a problem getting enough bloodflow to the heart to keep in nourished.  Second, there were no absolute arrthymias seen.  This indicates that while there were PVC's, there were no dangerous rhythms like ventricular fibrillation.   I'm uncertain as to the significance of the number of PVC's that you are having.  There was one PVC tachycardia seen.  This means that there were more than three in a row of PVC's that occurred at that point.  However, the rate was only 80 so this was not as significant as having this happen at a rate of 150 or 170.  The slower rate indicates that the rhythm most likely did not decompensate into a non-perfusing rhythm.  So, basically, I don't see anything imminently life threatening in this but I certainly recommend you follow up with your cardiologist regarding the number of PVC's you are having.  You may need a cardiac stabilizing medicine if this number is too high.  Sorry I can't be of more help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Alternatives to prescribed beta blocker?",
    "content": "I am a 24 year old female with a history of asthma, bronchitis, hyperthyroidism.  Also I suffer from an unexplained fast heartrate and have been so for almost 2 years.  Originally the doctors contributed it to the hyperthyroidism, where it was initially noticed when I first began having thyroid problems.  However, the thyroid has been well under control for the last 8-10 months, and the heart rate has not changed.  I have seen both a regular cardiologist and an electrophysiologist.  All the tests were run.  Numerous EKGs documented runs of sinus tachycardia anywhere from 120 to 190 bpm some which lasted hours on end.  I also underwent an Echo, tilt table tests, and an EP study.  The EP study did not produce a dangerous arrythmia, just a fast sinus rate.  Therefore they were unable to give me a diagnosis and told me to continue on my beta blocker.  Originally I took Propranolol but suffered bouts of hypotension and syncope.  So I am currently and have been for the last year 25 mg of Toprol XL.    However, as you have probably noticed that I have asthma and every doctor I have worries about that interaction with the asthma.  However, I have been able to take it alongside the asthma for that time frame.  However, my allergies and asthma are terrible and have not improved in a long time.  My allergist and pulmonologist want me to receive allergy shots, since I am frequently plagued by allergy attacks which turn into asthma attacks.  But the fact that I am on the Toprol makes the allergy shots impossible (they refuse to even attempt it).  Right now I am in a bad place.  The doctors don't want me off the Toprol because my heart rate speeds up without cause (before you ask they have basically determined it doesn't correlate with my anxiety).  However, I am frequently sick from the allergies and asthma, and find myself at the doctor and on antibiotics every few weeks.    I can't seem to get any suggestions from my doctors and neither the cardiologists or allergists want to change their opinion on what I should take.  I have heard that there are other types of blockers that can be used to treat tachycardia that don't interfere with allergy shots.  Any thoughts on what these are and if they could be effective?  I have heard though that some of these can make your heart problems worse?  Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Alternatives to prescribed beta blocker?",
    "content": "Hi Dacubster,  This is a very difficult situation.  It is very likely that the beta blocker is making your asthma worse.  It is also definitely contraindicated to give allergy shots while on beta blockers because the risk of a reaction goes up and the effects of the reversal medicine may be blunted.  On the other side of the issue is the fact that beta blockers are the best medication to treat idiopathic sinus tachycardia (idiopathic meaning unknown cause).  There is a class of medication called calcium channel blockers that do not exacerbate asthma and can have some effect in controlling heart rate.  They are not nearly as effective as beta blockers and don't work for some people.  It may be worth discussing a possible trial of this class of medicine with your doctor to see if it may be an option.  If it works, your asthma will likely get better and using the calcium channel blocker will allow you to receive the allergy shots if needed.  Unfortunately, there are many people who will not get sufficient control of their tachycardia with a calcium channel blocker but some do so it may be worth a try.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: leaky heart valve (John Kenyon Please)",
    "content": "Hi Mpmama294,  Believe it or not, slightly leaky valves are relatively common.  The severity of the issue depends on which valve is leaking and how badly it leaks.  Severe leaks can lead to an overworked heart because the heart has to pump the normal amount of blood plus the amount that leaks back in from the valve.  Often, mild leaks are not sufficient enough to cause problems.  For this reason, they are generally watched with periodic echocardiograms to be sure they aren't getting worse.    If the valve does get worse to the point that it will be a problem there are surgical repairs or replacements that can be done.    If the valve isn't leaking to that point, medications can be used to help decrease the amount of leaking that occurs and help protect the heart some.  The specific medicine used again depends some on the valve affected and its severity.  I suspect that in your case, given your leak is mild, your doctor simply wants to follow this over time and see what happens.  It is entirely possible that this may never worsen and never be a problem for you.  If it does begin to get worse there are other things that can be done.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It wonderful to have someone listen to you and not think that its all in your head. To have some one truely listen to you is amazing and i thank you for that, so much!  It was starting back in may that i found this site and you started to respond to me, you mentioned that i may have a connective tissue disorder due to the positive ana test that my doctors wrote off as nothing. I had and have many issues with my blood pressure and tachycardia, you listened to that and responded to my questions that the doctors i see wouldnt do, having had you to talk to made things easier for me.  I recently noticed pain in my shoulders all night long that just wouldnt let up so i tried my luck and went to the doctors. I noticed 2 hours before my appointment that my shoulders were coming out of socket it seemed like. So i showed it to the doctor who was amaized that my shoulders where sublaxing with out injury or pain. He told me that i was oddly hyperextended every where and that he wanted me to see orthopedics. Well that made me think back to what you said about connective tissue so i googled tachycardia and connective tissue and Elher-danlos came up and i was scared to find out that i had every problem listed for the Genetic syndrome well i thought POTS Postural othostasis tachcardia syndrome i have that already i know i do, that is thats whats the problem with my arrythmia and blood pressure.  SO when i met with Orthopedics that was yesterday he told me that its very possible that i have Ehlers-danlos syndrome and that i suffer from what seems to be POTS. He told me that almost every joint i have including my tmj is either hyperextended or sublaxing  and that i have snapping hips and there all signs of ehlers danlos. ITs really Scary but i now have a referal to rhumatology and they are going to run the tests for ehlers-danlos and related connective tissue disorders. Im so happy that at least now i know what all of me is shall i say is going to hell from.  SO talking to you and google really helped me to take an active role in my health care and i thank you so much.  ITs just really odd because i didnt know my dad and my sisters all seem to have the same problems as me as well as the POTS, so atleast me getting the tests will also aide them in there diagnosis, so we all have you to thank.  Thanks  Rachael\n\n",

I certainly don't mean to minimize the seriousness nor the long-term aggravation of Ehlers-Danlos Type 3, which is what it sounds like the doctor suspects and which would best fit your description of POTS and loose joints.

You should all have plenty of support from each other!  A decent prognosis is associated with E-D Type  3, although chronic orthopedic problems are usual. Please do keep us updated on what you learn!

    "content": "Hi Jenmonge,  PVC's occur when the cells of the ventricles decides it should make the heart beat, instead of waiting for the signal from higher up the chain.  Each cell of the heart has a \"time clock\" in it that is set to fire at a certain rate.  This is quite simplified but basically true.  I suspect that you were feeling the \"skipped\" beats (which really aren't skipped, just early) when your heart rate was low because the ventricle cells decided to help out and try to make the heart beat faster.  Heart rates in the 40's are a bit low but can be normal in highly trained athletes and those in very, very good shape.  I would recommend you see your doctor to have this evaluated.  If everything checks out, I would not be too concerned about the PVC's since they go away when the heart rate comes up.    The evaluation is important to be sure there isn't anything wrong with your heart, especially given the chest/arm pain.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I wanted to share my story in hopes for helping others and maybe solving my problem. I was a heavy coffee drinker for about ten years when I began experiencing skipped heart beats, heaviness, and breathlessness. When I was tested the skipped beat showed up on the EKG. the doctor sent me home with Zanax for anxiety. (I was not stressed at all until I could'nt breath!) I did not make the connection to caffeine at this time. This year I had several more attacks and was told that I should stop drinking caffeine. Emmediately I felt better. I began drinking herbal tea and again began having symptoms. I read that if the herbal tea contains orange peel or ma hung these are natural caffeines. I am switching to WATER for now on and hoping all of my symptoms go away.  Quick question: Since my very first attack my heart rate seems to drop very low to around 45-50 range. 55 being my normal heart rate now. I am 38 years old and also have a low blood pressure. Should I be concerned about my low heart rate since I am not an athlete and not considered in the best shape? Also, I have never seen a Cardiologist, would you recommend that I see one?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jenmonge, Some abnormalities in heart rhythms are classified, for example, as premature beats either in the atrium (top chambers of the heart, PAC's) or ventricles (bottm chambers of the heart, PVC's). Not all premature beats are considered significant or serious in nature. Some can be triggered by stimulants, caffeine, nicotine, certain over the counter medications typically usd for cold symptoms, alcohol, etc. Some of course are triggered by actual heart anomolies. The identification or diagnosis of whether a heart disorder does or does not exist is determined by a cardiologist who can identify even the most subtle changes. You may want to inquire regarding a referral from your primary care physician to assure there is no underlying disorder. I hope this answers your questions. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again, I was wondering if I should mention this to my doctor during my yearly check up. I posted on here before about palps during exercise. I had a echo done which was normal and a stress test that came back normal. I exercise all the time now and every now and then I'll get a skipped beat but its been alot better and happens less often! I did notice however anytime i go out for a drink and start dancing I get skipped beats. I'm not sure if they are making me short of breath. Sometime it feels like i get the air knocked out of me for a split second when it happens other times i just feel it skipped. SO i didnt know if when i feel it it causes some anxiety and i think i lose my breath or if its a symptom. And since i had a normal echo, stress test, 24hr holter moniter, and resting EKG should I be worried and tell my doctor or just ignore them? THanks!\n\n",

Some will admit the patient to the hospital when starting this medicine to be able to watch for this problem.

    "content": "I am a 44 year old female with controlled high blood pressure.I  have posted on here bofore i have had yet another Holter Monitor that showed just under 12,000 PVCs in a 24 hour period. The EKG showed only PVCS and my Echo was fine except the PVCS. Stress test was normal. I was taken off the 25 mgs of  Atenrol once a day and was put on 10mgs of Inderal 3 times a day. It seems to help only a little bit but if i take a half of xanex the PVCS cut down for a few hours But then they are back. The inderal   does not seem to controll my blood pressure quite as well as the atenrol. I am afraid to take  xanex everyday cause they are addictive. My doctor says that although the PVCS  are bothersome  they are benign. They may be benign but i am so tired and worn out from them. It is effecting my daily life.  I can not feel well with these things going on all day and all night, By 7pm i am so tired and worn that i need to rest.  Would  Catheter Ablation be an option for me? I asked my cardiologist and he said that if the meds did not work that he would refer me to a specialist. I am so confused about what to do. What is the risk and success for the ablation? Can i stay awake? I am scared of being knocked out. How long does the procedure take?  I did hear that sectral is sometimes effective in treating PVCs more then the other beta blockers. Is the fact that xanex helps mean that the ablation would not be helpful. I am just real tired of the PVCS taking over my life. 6 weeks now and i am tired. Forgot to mention that THere were 12 couplets 0 triplets and 5 bigeminy runs. There were 14 Superventricular Events 2 of them being couplets. my heart beat had 2 Bradcardia runs at 57beats per minute and 60 beats per minute  . My average was 85 on the holtor monitor So that being said  i would welcome your advise. Please ley me know if you think that giving Sectral may be worth a shot.THANKS A MILLION\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Capricekid,  12,000 PVC's is definitely quite a few.  My best advise for you would be to see a cardiologist that specializes in electrophysiology.  These are the cardiologists that do ablations for this should this be needed.    If the PVC's are all being started from the same area then an ablation may be an option.  I am not particularly familiar with all the risks/options of ablation.  It is performed by catheterization of the heart through a blood vessel in the groin area.  Regarding sedation, at the very least you'd be made quite sleepy.  Full anesthesia may be needed.  The cardiologist would be able to address the different options with you with much more accuracy than I can.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My fiancee is a 34 y/o male with no chronic health conditions other than he is however a recovering alcoholic who used to drink 4-12 beers a day for about 10 years and hasn't had a drink in well over a year. He has no significant past surgical history (tonsillectomy and deviated septum repair in 1997 and a hernia repair at age 6 months). He has a strong family history of heart disease on both sides. He currently takes no medications prescribed or OTC.  3 days ago I took him to urgent care because his heart rate was very irregular, he said he felt SOB and \"just didn't feel right\". Turns out he was in new onset A-Fib confirmed by 2 12 lead EKG's. His ventricular rate was not really tachy (ran between 72-114 but stayed in the 80's and 90's the majority of the time). He was transferred to the ER via ambulance on a monitor where they repeated a 12 lead and admitted him to telemetry. No interventions were done and he converted back to normal sinus on his own approximately 6 hours from the time I brought him in. Stress test and echo were normal. All blood work was normal except for a minimally elevated thyriod level. The consulting cardiologist discharged him without any concern other than to decrease his caffiene intake (my fiancee said the only thing he did different that day was drink a large green tea smoothie), and doesn't want to follow up with him.  This doesn't sit well with me considering his past alcohol use and family history. (I am an ICU nurse, but brand new..just out of school.) Should we get a second opinion or is this the standard of care?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - Given your fiance's personal and family history, plus the slightly elevated thyroid level, I would think a doctor would want to follow up routinely in a few weeks, unless there were more occurrences of the arrhythmia there's really not too much to be done, except perhaps to apply an event monitor, which might not have been a bad idea anyway. Very brief episodes of supraventricular arrhythmias, including A-fib, are not unusual, and given the history of alcohol use the episode described is not terribly surprising either. A second opinion might be wise, if only to establish a relationship with a cardiologist who could follow your fiance in the future if any further problems come to light. Otherwise, it is pretty much a judgement call.My personal preference would be to take a conservative approach.   Hope this is of some help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey, Im a generally healthy 21 year old male, just under 6 foot, 11 1/2 stone, don't smoke, drink ocassionally, and eat healthily.  Over the past few years I would ocasionally have palpitations once in a blue moon and just thought nothing of them and regarded them as normal.  however, recently I like to play a lot of squash and I noticed that when i really push myself in squash the palpitations got a lot more frequent and I got a fluttering in my chest.  I have no symptoms with my palpitations (shortness of breath, anxiety. chest pain etc) , and they go away pretty instantly.  I went to the doctor a few months ago who took blood and said everything was normal. They also put me on a 24 hour holter monitor.   During the monitor, I went for a 10 minute run, in which I had no symptoms, eg palpitations and it just felt like a normal run to me.  Anyway when i got the results back the doctor told me that I had SVT during the running phase of the recording and that this was the cause of my palpitations, and ive been refered to a cardiologist which im waiting on now.   SOO I have a few questions =)  1. I sometimes get palpitations when im sitting doing nothing, It just feels like a skipped beat/extra hard beat. My heart rate doesnt increase to 140-200 it just stays normal.   Therefore I don't think that SVT can be the cause of these palpitations?! Maybe it can, I don't know?   2. Seen as I wasnt even aware that anything was wrong during my running (felt like a normal run), I was diognosed with SVT.  This implies to me that probably everytime I exercise my heart \"goes into\" SVT....This doesnt sound the healthiest thing to me, is it dangerous?!   3. What is the chance that there is something serious behind the cause of my palpitations and SVTs like valve problems etc?  Thanks for your answers in advance! Dom\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dom321,  SVT can occur at any point.  It may happen while resting or while active.  If it was picked up on the holter monitor it is likely that SVT was present.  Regarding your questions, feeling the heart skipping beats or having extra beats without a rapid heart rate is very unlikely to be SVT.  It is more likely that you are experiencing premature ventricular contractions (PVC's) that can occur quite frequently in almost any person.    It is not necessarily the case that every time you run you experience SVT.  I would recommend you follow up with a cardiologist about this.  You may need some further stress testing to see if the SVT occurs frequently.  If it does, there are some medicines that can help prevent SVT.  Usually, SVT is not caused by structural problems like valve issues.  Following up with your doctor will be important to see if there are any other rhythm problems or treatments needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for replying!  i am meeting with a cardiologist as soon as one frees up!  I think im a bit of a hypercondriact to be honest, I have a few more concerns id like to ask you about because im worrying all the time =(:  1. Whilst sitting at the computer now, with each heartbeat i can see my tshirt move, is this normal? I always thought i had a strong heartbeat, and ive noticed that i can see mine very easily in my chest, for example, if I lie on my back with a pillow on my chest it will move the pillow with each beat! is this normal???  2. The last couple of times ive had my blood pressure checked its been \"borderline high\" i think it was about 142/96 (not 100% sure of the 2nd number but the first one is definently right). None of the doctors seem overly concerned at this,but personally I think that its bad that I have high blood pressure at my age (21)....  I do get *very* nervous when i get my BP checked (I feel my heart begin to race) so i think thats the reason its high - should I be overly worried about this seen as nobody else seems to be?  3. Similally to number 1, I can see my heart beat in my stomach after (around the belly button). I understand that there could be some link between this and an aortic anyurism. I can feel a pulse in my stomach if i push down on my stomach when im lying down, but i don't feel any pulsatable mass?!  should i be overly worried about this given my young age?  4. Ive also noticed that I sweat what I regard as more than normal. I will usually have sweat patches under my arms after a normal 10-15 minute walk, and I just turn to water in exercise conditions.  I sweat ridiculously when im nervous about somthing (for example giving a presentation)  Do some people just sweat more than others? is this normal? Ive had a blood test which says my thyroid gland is normal so what else could this be?  5. This is just a question for my own knowledge really - Why is it that high blood pressure is supposedly bad for you, but then we are encouraged to exercise (which raises your blood pressure) to keep your heart healthy.  Surely being stressed also puts a strain on your heart much like exercsing?!  Thanks for any answers you can give me  Dom\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - While waiting for Dr. Lowe to respond I think I can answer most of your secondary questions. First, while you may or may not suffer from hypochondria, you certainly are somatically aware (that is, overly aware of fine details about what your body is doing). This is sometimes associated with hypochondria, but also with somatisization and chronic anxiety. I'd hesitate to lable you based on your overconcern with your health at this pont.  As to the specific questions you raise:   1) it is quite normal to be able to see one's t-shrit move with the heart's beating. What isn't normal is looking down at your t-shirt while doing other tasks. However, since you are already tuned in to your heart's activity, this is not so surprising.   2) Your elevated blood pressure is, in absolute terms, higher than it ought to be. However, given your history of anxious preoccupation with  your health, it is likely your BP rises when it is taken, a la \"white coat syndrome.\" It is not excessively elevated and all persons' BP will vary over the course of a day and in varying circumstances anyway.  3) It is also not unusual for one to be able, if the effort is taken, to detect some pulsation in the abdomen. While it is true that visible pulsing in that area can be associated with an abdominal aortic aneurism, it is usually a quite pronounced pulsing with palpable mass. I would also guess your doctor has listened to your abdomen with a stethescope during exams and would have noted any bruits (abnormal sounds made by an aneurism). At your age, unless there is a distinctive family history of AAA you are rather unlikely to have that problem.  4) Your sweating sounds to be completely within normal limits. Your noting this also confirms your profound interest in what your body is doing, and an awareness of the smallest (and most normal) details.  5) High blood pressure is defined as blood pressure that is either briefly far too high to be healthy or is chronically elevated. Your readings don't qualify for either definition. It is a healthy sign of good cardiac output that one's BP raise during exercise, and then that is drops, slowly, back to normal limits at rest.   6) It is totally normal for persons who suffer from SVT to also experience the other, more normal, single premature beats which can come from the upper or lower chambers of the heart. Nearly everyone has these from time to time, only some of us are more aware of them than others. Once one begins to take notice of them it is difficult to divert the attention, but they are completely normal in and of themselves.   I hope this all serves to reassure you that you sound physically quite healthy even though you do experience occasional SVT, a condition which while very annoying is rarely dangerous.   Best of health to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - While all hormone-based birth control methods carry some risk of heart problems and blood clots that can go to the lungs, it sounds rather more as though what you're experiencing is the more benign side-effect of palpitations. If you truly are also having trouble breathing (and don't suffer from asthma already) then I'd advise you to mention this to your doctor. However, the rare cardiac and pulmonary \"adverse events\" associated with birth control drugs are usually a good deal more pronounced and dramatic. That being said, if the shortness of breath is pronounced and constant I would definitely bring it to the attention of a doctor - and of course I would anyway if that were the case.  Best of luck to you and please to keep in touch.\n\n",

I get chills and I have itchin spells also. I asked my mom if I could be taken to the ER but she says that it's most likely anxiety and that she won't take me because I got an EKG about 3 months ago (because of heart palpitations) and that the insurance probably won't cover the charges because of that. So right now I'm trying to stay calm but every time I look down at my chest it brings me no relief because of its irregular beat and flutterin and what not. So right now I'm sorta of in a quandary of what to do can anyone tell me what this might be? My mom said she'd take me to the primary care doctor on tue the 4th which is quite awhile from now so I'm sorta scared that I'll pass out or have heart failure (god forbid) if anyone can give me any relief i'd be eternally grateful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there - First suggestion I'd make is that you quit looking at it! Seriously, this would allow you to better evaluate whether or not you are experiencing any symptoms aside from the observed and preceived \"fluttering.\" See, those of us who are built so that we can see the apex of the heart moving the chest wall often perceive that motion as fluttering. We also, when  not actually taking our pulse, can perceive the rhythm of the heart to be bouncing or irregular.   Take your pulse at your wrist, for at least 15 seconds (then multiply the count by 4) and see what your rate is, and just how irregular it feels. I'm going to guess you were born in 1987? If so, and if you are thin enough to be  able to see your heart's movement in your chest, then the rate could be a little faster than average. If it is under 100 it is probably just fine.   You have apparently had palpitations  before,  and you need to know that this, in itself, is extremely common and can be caused by any one of a huge list of innocent things. Caffeine, nicotine, stress, anxiety, lack of sleep, etc., are but a few. Then again, most of us have some of this happen from time to time anyway, for no apparent reason.  The important  thing is to have it  evaluated, declared innocent/harmless, and then learn to live with that verdict even though the symptoms seem so unpleasant.   It's not always easy.  I hope you'll be able to spend a little time discussing this with a sympathetic doctor. It is almost always harmless, but it certainly can be crazymaking.   Good luck to you. Please do stay in touch.\n\n",

HR ~ 120+ bpm. towards the end of the palpitations i had tightness in the chest as well as felt some lightheadedness and felt like i was either going to pass out or throw up (same feeling as when i get postural hypotension). i had a small amount of caffeine more than 6 hours prior, but the pharmacist suggested it could be an adrenaline rush.   my only concern is that the palpitations have never lasted this long before and that it lead to chest tightness and lightheadedness. should i be concerned at all, or is this a normal thing that happens every now and then?\n\n",

When you stand or move, the heart normally responds by beating faster until the blood vessels appropriately constrict.  With thinner people this is sometimes more pronounced. If your blood pressure is on the lower end this response may be more pronounced as well.  It is worth seeing your doctor for a check up about this though.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 33 yo. female. for approximately 3 years now I have had a problem with chronic tachycardia. I no longer smoke as of 3.3 years, I no longer drink caffiene. Family cardiac Hx.- Maternal Grandfather fatal MI age of 51, Paternal Grandfather and Grandmother died at ages 35 and 38 yrs.- Sudden cardiac death- no medical findings at autopsy.    Atleast 10 hours of the day more than half of a months time  my heart rate is atleast 130 bpm at rest, excellerating to 160 bpm with activity. If you add heat or physical work it goes beyond that. My 12 lead ecgs, and event recorders all showed IST. I have been on numerous medications, at the time I take .125 Digitek twice daily and 40mg Verapamil twice daily. This still does not give me much comfort. I have had an E.P. study in which was unsuccessful, my tilt table test was negative. I have no thyroid problems- (labs. -, nuclear scan -, ultrasound-) as far as I know my echocardiograms have nothing abnormal. If my heart is not rapidly beating, I have these intermittent episodes where my heart is just throbbing- the beating is so intense I cannot stand it. I do know that during these episodes I have changes on my 12 lead ecg- It always shows up as an abnormal qrs-t angle, consider primary t wave abnormality. Sometimes I will have runs of pvc's with this. (usually 2 to 4) in a row When the throbbing heart beat stops my 12 lead ecg goes back to normal. My e.p. doctor doesn't show concern over it, just says that it is most likely an ectopic focus. The feeling of my heart throbbing like that is almost worse than the tachycardia- although that is somewhat disabling in itself at times. I know that feeling is not normal- it feels like my hearts contractility is multiplied times 100! This is not at all anxiety related- granted it has the tendency to cause that in its self sometimes!   Has anyone had a pt. with something similar to this? I certainly would appreciate any medical guidance someone could give me. I would do anything to get back to living a normal life.\n\n",

    "content": "I had an ablation done for SVT september 2006 and they burned 3 nodes and could not get the SVT back up so considered it successful. I continue to have some random PVC's and my heartrate would go up but not high enough to be SVT. A few days ago the SVT was triggered by standing up and dehydration and after some fluids it was gone again. The next 2 days the pvc's were frequent and yesterday I went to the doctor where they did an EKG that showed some infarction. I am a 24yo healthy female, 110 lbs 5'6, the doctor said that they were possibly picking up the ablation site on the EKG but after comparing it to my previous 2 EKG's that were also done after my ablation said that they did not show the infarction. They did some blood work which all came back fine and told me to follow up with my cardiologist.   I'm just wondering if the EKG was possibly picking up the ablation site after almost 1 year post-ablation when it wasn't picking it up before or if this would have to be something new. It's going to take me a few weeks to get into my cardiologist and since I'm not having horrible chest pain (just a little LUQ discomfort) they didn't request me to go into the ER. Thanks for any help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Bbtumblebug,  My knowledge of this particular subject is a little limited but I'll try to give you some helpful information.  If you develop worse chest pain, pain in the arms, jaw or back, sweating or any signs worrisome for heart problems you should be evaluated right away.  In the meantime it does seem reasonable to wait and see your cardiologist.  EKG's are very sensitive to lead placement.  If the wire lead was placed slightly wrong it can result in changes on the EKG.  So, probably the next step for you would be to have the EKG repeated by your cardiologist to compare.  If the areas are still present your cardiologist may want to do some further imaging studies of the heart or a stress test to see if there are any underlying issues.  It seems unlikely that an SVT ablation a year ago would just now be causing changes on an EKG; however, I'm not sure on this point.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rileysales,  Anxiety can certainly cause the symptoms you are describing.  The rolling sensation you are feeling may be due to PVC's (premature ventricular contractions).  These are often described as feeling like a missed heart beat; however, the beat did occur but too soon so the pause afterwards was longer.    If you are beginning to have this sensation more it is probably a good idea to see your doctor again to make sure everything is OK.  Cutting back on caffeine can help with PVC's and with anxiety so this is a good idea.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 64 year old male in very good physical condition. About five years ago I was diagnosed with PVC's and put on 50 mg Toprol XL which successfully negated them. This past February they came back and I would have continuous episodes lasting from one to three days. After subsiding, I would have from one to three weeks without the PVC's. They normally began in bed at night.  I exercise a lot, walking four miles every morning without any problems.  For the past four days the PVC's have started up every morning about 15 minutes after I awake. They usually go away mid, to late afternoon. Sometimes in the late morning I get a little lightheaded. They affect me much more than in the past.  I presently take 25 mg Toprol in the morning along with 5 mg Hytrin for mild hypertension, and another 25 mg Toprol in the evening.  Since I am getting no relief from the PVC's, would I be better off taking the entire 50 mg Toprol in the morning and the Hytrin at bedtime or vice versa. Perhaps this would alleviate the lightheadedness since the combination of Toprol and Hytrin might be dropping my blood pressure.  My cardiologist is among the best thought of in the city; however, when we talk about PVC's I get the normal cardiologist calming discussion about how I just have to put up with them.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

But, the smoke in the house does raise the risk for SIDS, as well as respiratory ailments like asthma.  If you are concerned about your baby's breathing, you should see a health care provider for an exam.  At two months it is a good time to get a well baby checkup anyway.  Her immunizations are due and there are important measurements to be taken.  Discuss the smoking issues and your concerns about her breathing with your care provider.

    "title": "8 beat run of PVCs",
    "content": "I am a 55 y/o female - somewhat overweight - don't drink.  I have suffered from PAC/PVCs for 20 some years.  Had an event monitor 6 years ago that showd 3 beat run of idoventricular rhythm, 3 beat run of v tach with an average rate of 130 BPM along with sinus rhythm and frequent PAC and short runs of ectopic atrial thythm.  Symptoms correlated with both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias.  I have been managed with 50mg of Toprol XL, mevacor for cholesterol and 81 mg of aspirin,  although I do get skipped beats almost everyday (sometimes 1 or 2 - sometimes many more). I have always been told not to worry about these, that they are not life threatening.   I just had an event monitor again, and the cardiologists office called and said I had some strips that showed a couple of 8 beat runs of PVCs. and they made an appointment for me for Sept 26th to come in and discuss these.  I should also mention that a year ago I had a 64 slice ct coronary angiogram that showed a complete 100 % blockage of my RCA , but with good collaterols.  Where the blockage is, I am not a candidate for by-pass or angioplasty with a stent.  I have no angina or symptoms from this blockage, and all other areas of the heart looked clear. Calcium score 3 - echocardiogram showed normal heart with ef of 55 -60%.  While I was wearing this last event monitor I was under severe stress, had just started taking care of my bedridden mother, and was gettting very little sleep, not eating much, worrying about her, and had just started drinking diet soda.  Could you tell me how dangerous a couple of runs of 8 PVCs are?  They didn't call me immediately after I transmitted the recordings, so I know they weren't life threatening then - but I would like to be prepared when I see the cardiologist in Sept.  Thank you so very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Tomah,  As you mention,  PVC's are very common.  8 beat runs of PVC's are a little more concerning.  Primarily because there is an increased chance that they could continue.  Your cardiologist may recommend some more testing to make sure everything is OK.  It very well may be that these episodes were due to your increased stress.  If you were drinking more caffeine than usual this may have contributed also.  I would not be over concerned but follow up with your cardiologist is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - While  the initial episode of syncope (blacking out or passing out) was apparently caused by a long sinus pause - something sometimes seen in conjunction with A-fib and especially when related to sick sinus syndrome (SSS), the subsequent symptoms do sound more medication related. That being said. it is impossible to evaluate such a situation at a distance, and the whole patient and history has to be taken into consideration. Sotolol can cause a variety of untoward side effects, but the ones you describe are rather unusual. I suspect you have something remote going on, at least as far as the GI symptoms go, and it may even be causing the light-headedness. Perhaps an  event monitor could be ordered by your physician in order to see if your heart is doing anything untoward during these episodes.   Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I'm a 34 y/o male with a past diagnosis of benign PVCs and Anxiety/Panic attacks. I have a family history of heart disease and high blood pressure (but I haven't been affected by those... yet). I currently take 20mg Prozac once daily and 1mg Ativan prn for anxiety/panic attacks.  I have been suffering with frequent PVC's since I was about 27 y/o. I have had a battery of tests (Echo, EKG, ECG, Holter etc.) numerous times. I've seen three different cardiologists over the years and numerous visits to the ER, with the same results \"You're fine. Everyone has PVCs from time to time.\"  I've been doing much better until the last few days. I've started having more frequent PVCs. I'm not entirely sure if I'm using the correct medical term, but they seem like \"runs\" of bigeminy (beat skip beat skip beat skip) where every other \"beat\" is felt as a pause. Usually 6 to 10 of the beat/skips in a row, then three or four regular beats then either the bigeminy returns or sometimes trigeminy for a few beats. It only seems to last for a couple of hours.  I have become extremely sedentary as of late and been smoking more than usual. I know that these things can make them worse. I'm just really wondering, is this something that I should be overly concerned about? I have never experienced this level of PVCs (the bigeminy). I have a structurally normal heart as of about a year ago. All the cardiologist have told me that I'm fine, and I don't need to follow up with them. I'm not having any dizziness or SOB associated with these attacks.  I guess, I'm really just looking for some reassurance and advice. These things have taken over my life. I can't work, lost health insurance and have become a complete shut in.   I appreciate any help and advice. Sorry for rambling on like this. =)\n\n",

    "title": "Low potassium level and PVC'S",
    "content": "I have had pvc's for past 20 years and have progressed from infrequent attacks with months free to almost constantly in last 7 years. Their most frequent its every three beats, averages every five to seven beats. I have holter moniter every 2 years have been observed in hospital with them and had echo of heart and told completely harmless, heart function is normal.  I am 46yr old female - overweight but reducing slowly, normal blood pressure - underactive thyroid on medication and TSH within normal range.  These last few years the constant pvc's have been causing me much anxiety - I am a chronic worrier about anything health related so having pvc's is not good!!  I accept most of the time that after 20 years my wonky heartbeat is harmless but extremely unpleasant , it goes away when I get active and my heartrate increases and comes back when I am at rest and heartrate slows so its classic.  6 months ago i was taken to hospital for unrelated problem that turned out to be IBS but I had huge amount of blood tests that were all normal except one and that was my potassium level. I was told it was bordeline normal at the very bottom of normal range and to eat more bananas!!  I asked it was of concern and they said not at all as its not low low just bottom of normal range.  According to John Kenyon in previous post low potassium levels can make pvc's much more frequent in someone prone to them - I have to say thank you reading that post was so reassuring that my pvc's were normal and not life threatening.  I am going to discuss this potassium question with my GP later this week and would be grateful if I could have a bit more information so I can print the answer out for my GP to see.  I am assuming from the information in the post I read that as I have frequent pvc's that my potassium level needs to be better than in the low range of normal ( I appreciate that the UK and USA use different measuring criteria so you may ot know what UK ones are).   I have tried everything over the years - no caffeine - no alcohol- taking magnesium and Q10 supplements with no effect so if the problem could be reduced by increasing my potassium levels I would be a seriously happy bunny!\n\n",

    "content": "I know there has been no replies to my question but I thought I would just place an update as I have been to see my Dr. Here in the Uk the potassium connection with pvc's does not seem to be well known. The Dr agreed that my potassium levels in past year ( there were 4 results) were all within normal range but lower than 4. Mostly 3.6-3.8. She said this would be due to having leaky kidneys which I have had all my life but I was still maintaining a potassium level within the normal range. She advised me to eat more bananas, green leafy veg and fruit juices to see if this would increase my potassium levels to above 4. She did not want to give me a potassium supplement as she said these could raise my levels too much and be dangerous whereas my slighly low level is not dangerous. Thank you to the people who have read my post.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there - Sorry to be so  late in responding, but I have been out of town for about a month and missed this post.   There are several important points to make and/or emphasize where you have already mentioned them.  First, PVCs are extremely common in the general population of otherwise healthy people. Some have lots, some have very few, but all of us have some at one time or another. Those with  certain essentially benign conditions such as mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVPS) have more as a rule.  Some are aware of every premature beat. Others are always unaware of them or are not bothered by those they do feel. (I envy those people). And of course, PVCs provoke great anxiety in a lot of people; conversely anxiety can cause more PVCs as it causes the chronic release of adrenaline (a cardiac stimulant  and  irritant) into the blood stream. The most important thing to remember is that unless there is some significant disease of the left ventricle,  PVCs are almost never of any consequence. The  one big exception to this, of course, is a  severe lack of potassium (K) in the body.   You have documented a low-normal postassium level on more than one occasion,and the kidneys are  often blamed for this problem. (The numbers you cite would be considered acceptable were you not showing frequent PVCs and being  bothered by them). When a patient presents with a lot of PVCs most doctors now like to see the level at 4.0 or above.    There is one other possible cause for unexplained  postassium loss: celiac disease.  This is an intestinal malabsorbtion problem caused by an autoimmune reaction in  the GI tract, and usually is highlighted by some  other symptoms as well, such as gassiness, bloating and vague GI discomfort.  It is a reaction to gluten,  which occurs in most wheat and a number of other foods.  It  can be detected by a specialized blood test that is not routinely ordered.   It is not unrealistic to seek  relief from the palpitations  caused by frequent PVCs if  there is a conviction on the part of your doctor that low K is the likely cause of the problem.  Up to 20 meq of slow-release  potassium is often prescribed  and many times this will  reduce the frequency of PVCs to a more acceptable level without driving the K level up to dangerous levels (a single follow up K level should  be done after about a week  of therapy, during which time an improvement should be seen if low K is in fact  the cause).   Hope all this is helpful.  Please stay in touch.\n\n",

Often, with SVT the heart rate will be normal then suddenly become quite rapid (as if someone has turned on a switch).  Heart rates that slowly increase to their maximum are less suggestive of SVT.  The squatting may be increasing the blood pressure to the heart enough to break the SVT cycle.  I would recommend you see your doctor for an ECG and probably a continuous heart rate monitoring device such as a holter monitor or an event recorder to try to catch your ECG during an episode.

    "content": "Hello tiredmom82 - What you're describing sounds like classic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) although it's impossible to be certain without having seen an EKG rhythm strip taken during an episode such as you describe. However, you say also that you were diagnosed with \"sinus tach\" via Holter monitor. Sinus tach has a theoretical high end above which the rate almost surely is coming from some other focus than the sinus node, although still supraventricular in  origin (above the ventricles). The  additional symptoms may or may not be secondary to the extremely rapid heart rate. Again, it's difficult to tell at a distance, but sudden bouts of rapid heart rate can cause any number of secondary symptoms including headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, etc. The fact that your rate was too fast to count suggests SVT also. I would strongly recommend that, if you haven't already done so, you be seen by a cardiologist (I'm not clear from your post whether or not the Holter monitor was ordered by a cardiologist or a general practictioner). It would be even better if you could be referred to an electrophysiollogist, a cardiologist who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias. If this problem occurs occasionally and/or lasts for long periods of time (more than 10-15 minutes) it should be diagnosed and treated, etiher with medication or possibly radio frequency ablation (this latter is a minimally invasive procedure which can, in the majority of such cases, eliminate the problem once and for all).   The most common cause of SVT in young, otherwise healthy people is actually a problem in the atrioventricular (AV) node between the upper and lower chambers, when an abnormal nerve pathway allows electrical impulses to multiply and the heart rate to speed up to sometimes remarkable rates. When this happens sometimes the heart beats so fast that it doesn't have time to completely refill after each beat, so that it is difficult to feel a pulse at the wrist at all (readial pulse deficit). This is not a life-threatening problem (if my guess as to the cause is correct) but is certainly a lifestyle-threatening one, which can interrupt normal activiities (including sleep) and create a lot of anxiety and undue caution in trying to live a normal life. It should be corrected so that you don't have to wonder when it will do it again and curtail activities because of that concern.   Again, I strongly urge you to try and get referred to an electrophysiologist, who likley could pick out the site of origin from a resting EKG and might want to perform an EP study. If such a study revealed the exact site of origin of the episodes, it could be ablated right then, via radio frequencies (RF ablation) and the problem solved once and for all. It is certainly worth a look!   If the other symptoms continue once this problem has been brought under control, then you would want to look at them separately. I think, though, it is likely they are somehow secondary to the episodes you've been  experiencing.  Good luck with this and please do let us know what you learn.\n\n",

I went to the er yesterday my doctors wanted me to go because i woke up at 1 in the morning with sinus tach again and it wouldnt go away i was scared really dizzy and feeling sick it lasted the rest of the night and all day when i went to the er my resting rate was 112 and when sitting it was 128 and when standing it was 140 i had no relieve from it they ran an ekg and xray and labs the eco showed sinus tach and all the rest of the tests are fine. I have a uti and there not sure if this was causing the long lasting symptoms, but the er doc def noticed that posture changes my rate.. so i don't know what that means. I do know that i feel just awful and im having numbness in the back of my neck and forhead don't know what that means either but i see my doctor in one week... which i think stinks.  The er doc talked to my doctor so i guess its sinus tach all along. They put me back atenolol but only 15 mg they said that where i am only 95 lbs that i should of never been on such a high dose like i was before. I know that this condition what ever it is, is not stable and i don't know what to do becuase beta blockers never worked well before anyways. I also know that i get tachy after i eat to which i don't understand. I have broken blood vessels all over my body my hair falls out and i am always cold. On top of that i keep having problems with my bowel swelling up and hospitalizing me. I had colonoscopy and i showed nothing but the surgeons always want to do exploratory surgery. Over all i am not well but i have to say that this scares me the most. I am trying to keep on top of my health but theres always a new problem to add to the list. My doc trys to blame it on anorexia because i can gain weight and i am to thin but my appitite is so great if i don't eat every 2 hours like clock work im sick, thyroid is fine they rechecked it in er and my blood sugar is good. don't have crohns or colitits, i did have a positive ana test. But what ever is causing these issues i hope its comes to an end soon. THANKS so much for listening to me im feeling a bit alone with all of this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again! Well based on the  heart rates you mentioned in this post, this is consistent (barely, though, when standing) with sinus  tachycardia rather than SVT, but it is clearly inappropriate tachycardia (not justified by the activity going on at the time it happens). This, in itself, is also not life-threatening, but the underlying cause has to be found. While  SVT is usually caused by an irritable focus in some part of the mid-to-upper heart, sinus tach usually is caused by either a metabolic problem  or some flaw in the autonomic nervous system (that part of  the nervous system that controls involuntary bodily behavior). If your bloodwork has all been normal then  you may have what is known as dysautonomia, which is just a fancy way of saying your autonomic nervous system isn't working as it should. It \"thinks\" your heart needs to speed up at the wrong time.  There are tests and exams that can usually pin this down, but it usually winds up being treated initially with beta blockers (to slow the rate) and sometimes an exercise regimen. It is a frustrating  problem  if this is what's going on. If it should be a metabolic problem (and thyroid has already been ruled out) and can be identified, then  it is fairly easy to treat.   You have supplied some additional interesting facts that could bear on your problem.  While the thyroid is supposedly fine, some of the  tihings you mention,such as your low weight,  hair loss and cold extremities would suggest some sort of thyroid problem. Then again, you had a positive ANA, which suggests strongly the presence of some  sort of autoimmune/connective tissue disease. This can be very undifferentiated and so can cause all sorts of seemily unrelated and crazy symptoms.  It  may account for some of your complaints, and it may even ultimately explain  the tachycardia, although the inability to gain weight makes it sounds like your metabolism is running too fast and that would be accompanied by a faster heart rate, among other things, which brings us back to the thyroid, which seems to be OK.   This could  take some time to sort out, but if you do suffer from an autoimmune problem it can affect almost any body system at any given time and so could  be responsible for all your symptoms.  Aside from a cardiologist,  your doctor may wind up referring you to a rheumatologist, as they are currently the most knowlegeable about connective tissue disease. With that postive ANA it is a very likely possibility. And  again, while not usually life threatening, it can be a very, very frustrating problem, as when  one problem is solved often a different one will  pop us.   I wish you all the luck in the world in looking for the solution to this,  but I do believe you can  at least take some comfort in the knowlege that there is not likely any serious, impending problem, but more likely a long-term, intermittent series of aggravations.    Please do stay in touch and  let us know if you learn  anything new.\n\n",

    "content": "So i went for my appointment today and my dr whom i convinced that i eat talk with an endocrinologist and they decided that i should be checked for phaeochromacytoma which i know nothing about, given that i eat every 2 hours he thinks that i have a super fast metabolism, my thyroid check out okay so he thinks that its phaeochromacytoma so i have to do a 24 hour urine, and see cardiology and have a holter put on again tomorrow. Plus i get to see gastro. I think that maybe, big maybe that it is metabolic, i guess i do have symptoms of this he stated i sweat all day long it literally drips down my arm i just always thought that it was normal for me. But thanks so much i think your posts have been somethng real for me. Which by the way i did mention to my Dr. I told him isnt tachycardia a symptom of somthing else and he agreed so hes going fishing and seeing what he can find. I have had kidney surgery when i was 18 because i had a lump in my abdomen that was painfull and the urologist said that my kidney was displaced and he had to put i back because it was in danger of pinching my ureter. I don't know if that maybe had something to do with this, i know that i have a graft on my right kidney to hold it in place and i wonder if that could be irritating my adrenal glands i don't know im just so happy the my dr see's it for what it is (not anerexia). He even went as far as saying that my tachycardia is from anerexia. Today i told him that im not hearing it anymore and im glad he is attempting to change his view. Once again i thank you for you help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - Wow! Well that's one possibility I'm surprised I didn't think of, but it's good news because it really would explain most of the symptoms. It is entirely possible that the surgery involving your kidney could have irritated the adrenal gland sitting on top, or may have simply stirred up something that was waiting to happen. At any rate the diagnosis really does fit, and this  is often a relatively simple fix. Pheochromocytoma is caused by one or more adrenal tumors. If there is just one and it's on  the actual gland it's easy to locate. However, they can also occur in various parts of the viscera, and finding them can sometimes be a chore. But once treated or removed they can no longer produce the excess adrenaline which causes the symptoms, so there is definitely help on the horizon!   Best of luck to you as you and the endocrinologist figure out the best way to mange or fix this, and thank goodness it  was finally figured out! If they are right (and the 24 hour urine test should make that clear) you may be looking at a huge change for the better. The history of surgery involving a kidney makes it seem all the more likely to me.   Please do keep in touch and you are very welcome. You've done the most important part of the work by being persistent. Again, good luck to you and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Well my lab work came back not the 24 hour urine but my blood work.... My doctor wrote in his notes that i have low potassium, low bun and low creatine.. don't know what that means! My throid again her ran and that came back my T3 was 125 1 month ago and now its 147 don't know what that means, my t4 is 8.3 and my tsh is .54 so i see him in 3 weeks to follow up, his notes that i can see and i told him that i could state that he belives eating disorder again..My holter is being read on monday and hopefully that can shed some light! But i guess when i had my ekg is showed more sinus tachycardia don't know the rate though he dosent mention. Im pretty much lost right now im upset because i don't know what to do i just feel awful. At work today i couldnt even function my heart was just pounding to much good thing i had the holter on. I counted my pulse and it was 180. Im just so tired and i think that if my urinalasis dosent show anything then im just going to get a different doctor, i can i guess prove to him that i don't have an eating disorder so i guess its about that time. I guess im just in fear for my life now. Kinda scared more then ever because i can no matter what get my heart rate down. Im finding it hard to work because its to much for me. Laying in bed is my only relief. This is the second time my potassium has been low the first time was when i found out i was allergic to asprin, and sick as a dog. Are these labs consistant with pheocromacytoma? You seem to be the only one that listens to me and i so appreciate that!! Thanks Rachael\n\n",

    "content": "Well more has come to light, then, if not everything as yet (I'm still anxious to see what the 24 hour urine test yields, if anything). The fact that your T4 is a little higher than normal and your T3 is normal (but higher than before) and your TSH is higher than normal (but not through the roof) would normally suggest possibe underactive thyroid, but with your symptoms, one would expect the opposite. Those symptoms would be more consistent with an overactive thyroid and what you sound like you could have is Graves' Disease, except that the numbers of your thyroid panel argue against that. However, there are two other possibilities. One is that you still may have pheochromocytoma, which you won't know until you get back the results of the 24 hour urine test. The other is that higher-than-normal TSH levels are sometimes seen in people with disease of the pituitary gland, and if that should be so, then the symptoms would be consistent with that as well.   It's going to require the endocrinologist looking at all the results as a whole to figure it out, but it really does sound like either hyperthyroidism (which it almost certainly isn't), pheochromocytoma, or a problem with the pituitary gland.   You have stated that you have a ravenous appetite, so to be thin and having difficulty losing weight would seem to rule out an eating disorder - unless it is bulimia, which I'm sure you would have mentioned. This probably keeps coming up because of your low potassium levels, something very common in bulimics. In fact, for people with bulimia, the loss of potassium due to self-induced vomiting is usually what leads to the disease being fatal if not treated. From all youve stated here, that cannot be the problem, so I'm looking at a glandular, metabolic issue, one of three possible, and one of those seems to be ruled out (hyperthyroidism) because of your thyroid test results.  The BUN and creatinine levels being low usually have no meaning, although low creatinine is sometimes seen in people with MS, but again, none of your symptoms suggest MS even remotely.   I think it's really important to get the 24-hour urine results and see how that fits into the overall picture. If that doesn't expose the culprit then your doctor will need to rule out a problem with the pituitary gland.   By the way, a heart rate of 180 is definitely in the SVT range and can be exhausting and very frightening. It isn't normally life-threatening, but it can leave you feeling as though you've just run around the block. It needs to be moderated by some means, just so you can function while the rest of the detective work is being done. Beta blockers are usually the best way to slow this down.   The labs you've gotten back so far don't tell you much about pheochromocytoma. The 24-hour urine test will, if that is the case. If not, you'd do well to find another doctor.   Best of luck to you, and hang in there. The circle is at least getting smaller. Something should turn up soon.\n\n",

It may also show up with pituitary problems (and the two can of course be related). That's not to say it couldn't be some other, independent problem, but given all the rest that's been going on, it seems likely to be related to an endocrinological matter and should be brought to the attention of the endocrinologist as soon as possible.

    "content": "Hi - The thyroid numbers are more suggestive of hypo rather hyper activitity of the thyroid, while the symptoms you describe seem to suggest precisely the opposite situation. I still feel an endocrinologist needs to look at your pituitary functioin.   As for the cardiac figures you've provided, the only one that jumps out as troubling is the high rate of 159 (if that is while at rest). While not life-threatening, it has to be annoying beyond belief. The low rate of 53 is actually OK, and rare atrial and ventricular contractions are both totally normal and found routinely in the healthy general population. It's just that unusually high rate that attracts untoward  attention, and it is the underlying cause that must be uncovered. If it's not SVT then it has to be due to an endocrinological or metabolic imbalance. Again, an endocrinologist needs to be involved, although so does a cardiologist to rule out some electrical abnormality.   Hang in there. You've eliminated a lot of the more serious potential causes, but this still needs to be understood and managed so that you can be happy and function normally.   Please let us know what you learn. I'm encouraged that there are only rare premature heartbeats, as that really is a \"nothing\", as is the lower resting rate.   We'll be waiting for further word from you.\n\n",

    "content": "Regarding your first issue, it sounds like costochondritis which is inflammation of the cartilage of the ribs.  It can be quite painful at times and the pain is often recreated by pushing on the affected rib.  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen are generally quite good at treating this pain.  Your second issue with the occasional skipped beats is a fairly common thing.  It is not unusual for the heart to occuasionally have a \"missed\" beat, which is really an early first beat followed by a prolonged pause then the next beat picks up.  No pause would have been noticed if the 1st beat hadn't been early.  As long as these are infrequent and do not get worse with activity it is likely that they are innocent occurences and not dangerous.  If they begin to happen more often, you begin having symptoms due to them, or if you are concerned I would recommend you see your doctor for an ECG to look at the heart rhythm.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello smc246 - You appear to be one of those people who has premature heartbeats routinely, with rare runs (which constitute, according to the book, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia or NSVT, if there are 3 or more in a row). Your doctor did the prudent thing in performing a Cardiolite stress test to rule out evidence of cardiovascular disease and structural heart disease. Premature beats (most commonly PVCs, as in your case) in themselves are not diagnostic of anything and are generally completely benign. When there is a run of V-tach detected (which is the result of sheer chance) it is appropriate to investigate further. Finding nothing, it then becomes something of a non-issue. V-tach is generally only of concern when the left ventricle is diseased and not functioning properly. That has been ruled out.   Anxiety can produce more PVCs and even runs of V-tach in some people, and young, healthy people can generally tolerate the V-tach and may not even be aware of it. Both PVCs and related arrhythmias are more likely to occur during pregnancy due to the hormonal changes and the slow, progressive crowding of the heart's space. (The heart doesn't like to be crowded and will often \"kick back\" by discharging some early beats).   It would probably be wise to be followed for this during your pregnancy, but it seems unliikely a doctor would prescribe a beta blocker for you unless the benefits outweigh the risk to the fetus. These decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, and if your doctor should decide this to be an appropriate therapy for the irregular heartbeats, he or she would certainly counsel you extensively on the pros and cons. Beta blockers are not known for any remarkable teratogenic problems, but anything taken during pregnancy must be weighed for its potential risk.   Unfortunately the same thing holds true for anti-anxiety medications, which would probably benefit you as well. Again, your doctor is in the best position to make this call.   It sounds as though your are in pretty good shape overall, but if the anxiety can be managed the PVCs and associated arrhythmias would probably be reduced, which would be all to the good.  Best of luck to you and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome. It is one of the more difficult things in life, I think, for people who are aware of these irregularities (and some actually can't feel them!) to accept that they are benign when they feel so bizarre and scary. Even when we have accepted that odd fact they still catch us off-guard and sometimes set off that internal alarm, which is really the most unpleasant part of the experience.   Management of anxiety is more difficult during pregnancy for the simple reason that doctors are, very reasonably, reluctant to prescribe many drugs that would otherwise be a first-line approach to many problems.   Pregnancy is something of a challenge without the added aggravation of something like this. One thing to bear in mind is that you're in good company. This is an extremely common problem in the general population to varying degrees.   All the best to you in the coming months. I feel certain that once the newcomer has arrived all this will seem like it just flashed by.\n\n",

Non-smoker, but use smokeless tobocco.  Very little sleep on a regular basis, and I deal quite well with the stress of daily life.  Family history of hypertension (mother's side only).  No surgeries, other than a knee surgery back in High School.  However, a couple times a year a get a little heart irregularity.  I'll be doing normal stuff, and my pulse will diminish for a beat, then a little more for another, then WHOOSH!!! one big pulse beat.  It will occur ocasionally for an hour or so, then not again for months.  Does this sound like PVCs?  Medics that I've worked with seem concerned when PVCs come up on the 12-lead, but I also know that emergency medicine and clinical medicine are worlds apart.  Should I be concerned?  If treatment isn't necessary (other than to remove the annoyance), then I probably won't seek treatment.  Two reasons: I'm stubborn, and I have a HMO.  :-)  But, if it can wait until my next doctor's appointment, I'll probably just wait.  Thanks...\n\n",

    "content": "Hello cavis - Yes, what you describe certainly does sound like  PVCs. Of course absent an EKG or Holter monitor it's difficult to say if all (or any) of them are PVCs (could also be PACs or PJCs) but your graphic description sounds like classic PVCs, and the occurence also is classic, in that it is rather random-appearing. Of course if you wanted  you could quite possibly connect their occurence to a any of a number of innocent things like lost sleep, digestion, dozing off, adrenaline, etc.  PVCs are actually fairly normal for most of us, as are PACs.  They tend to appear randomly and can show up in little episodes such as you describe, or can  be  fairly frequent,  occurring in some subjects at  the  same time every day or even  all day and into the night. Others have them when getting ready to go to sleep.  As I'm sure you know, the only true cause for concern over PVCs comes with a low LVEF in someone with a damaged or diseased heart. You appear to be remarkably healthy, with the exception of hypertension, which is one more good argument (along  with the  potential for oral cancer) to break  the  smokeless tobacco habit. It is working against whatever medication you're taking to reduce the elevated BP which, as you know can, over time, damage the heart and even cause CHF. That clearly hasn't happened yet, but many people rationalize this away with the \"Lots of time  to quit\" self-delusion. The problem with that one is that the injury to the heart (and other parts of the body) can  be cumulative.   OK, enough of the lecture. As far as the technical question, I am sure you've described PVCs. I  don't feel there's any reason for conern about them, but I do know how bothersome  they can  be. I'm  more concerned about the smokeless tobacco, but you're in the business and I won't beat you over the head about that one.   In the absence of a severely comromised lef ventrical there is almost  never a reason  to treat PVCs unless they are simply driving the subject crazy (and if they are frequent enough they can). Since yours appear to be fairly infrequent the treatment (a beta blocker) wouldn't make  much sense. No need for concern here, at least not about the PVCs. Hope this helps ease your mind. Treat yourself right! You'll be glad you did later on.\n\n",

After the longest discussion I've ever had with a doctor, he decided to set me up with a stress test, my first.  I'll be interested to see how that goes.  I went out on a fire last night, and after a brief yet very physical burst, the PVCs were very prevelant, so I'm sure that they will show during the stress test.  And as for the smokeless tobacco, I hear about that quite a bit, especially from my Dental Hygienist wife.  Not in denial or anything, it's just a bad habit.  Once again, I appreciate the help and this site.  Keep up the good work!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again - I'm kind of glad you wound up bringing this to a doctor's attention, not so much because of the PVCs per se, but because people of your size and build are more prone to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and that's something that can be ruled out while you at the same time get a good estimate of your overall cardiac health. For a firefighter/EMT it's something that should be required (in my humble opinion).   You mention that after a short burst of physical exertion the PVCs showed up. They often will do that after exertion, and it's normal - but it also got me to thinking about your build and the slightly greater risk of a thickened left ventricle. In people with that problem, post exercise is the most vulnerable period. The presence of PVCs alone doesn't suggest anything, but it is like a little tap on the shoulder. I'm glad you're having this done. Chances are you'll walk away with an extremely clean bill of health and yet another browbeating about weight, tobacco use and stress, but those are all controllable risk factors.   All the best to you. Please stay in touch.\n\n",

A tachy-brady arrhythmia can be caused by medication, and can also be a malady of the heart's electrical system.  One version is called a sick-sinus syndrome, and can be pretty serious. Certain legal and illegal drugs have serious impact on the function of the heart.  Only tests can reveal what is happening to her - and there may be simple treatment options available, depending on the cause.  Please have your friend either see her family doctor or go to a local emergency room to look further into her complaint, and symptoms.\n\n",

    "content": "My 13-year old daughter recently had an ECG prior to starting the medication imiprimine for enuresis.  Her ECG stated 'borderline prolonged QT' with a QTc of 450.  She was started on the meds and told to repeat the ECG in one month.  The repeat ECG was essentially the same with a QTc of 451.  Since the imiprimine wasn't effective the pediatrician told me to increase the meds from 25mg to 50mg.  I was also told the ECG was 'fine'.  It wasn't until I requested copies of the ECG that I noticed the borderline QT.   My family has an extensive history of MI's.  My mother was 46 when she passed from and MI and my brother was 40.  I also lost a brother to an auto accident (he rolled his vehicle) when he was 28.  My mother's sister passed from a cerebral hemorrhage at age 34 and her brothers  passed from MI's at the ages of 43, 44, and 47. I had a 24 holter monitor a year ago for 'skipped beats'.  I was told I had 1,200 PVC's and they were harmless, but nothing about QT intervals.  So I assume I am heart healthy. My husbands 8 siblings are living and healthy and his parents are in their 80's. Is there any danger in being borderline QT? Should my daughter be taking imiprimine with a borderline QT?  Should she have other testing? We have four other children.  Should they be tested? Isn't  LQTS hereditary?  Wouldn't my husband or I have to have LQTS in order for our children to be effected? I know the right thing for me to do is speak to my daughter's pediatrician and give him/her the opportunity to explain the findings.  I plan to when I work up the courage.  It is very difficult for me to do.  I do not want to appear paranoid, or as if I am questioning the pediatrician's ability.  But maybe he/she would feel differently if they knew my extended families history.\n\n",

Because of this, if anyone is found to have long QT syndrome the other members of the family should be screened with an ECG.  440 is considered the cut off for a normal QTc (an adjusted QT to take into account heart rate).  Given your daughters QTc of 450 she should see a cardiologist to follow up on this.  Sometimes medications are used to help prevent any problems from the Long QT.  Imipramine can prolong the QT interval futher and should be avoided with Long QT syndrome.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am a 25 year old female, 125lbs, maternal family history of heart disease, with an uncontrolled mild seizure disorder (simple partial seizures). I also have a history (3 occassions) of unexplained tachycardia. I've listed below, in chronological order, the symptoms I have been experiencing over the past 2 weeks:  1. Initial bout of tachycardia (lasting ~ 2-3 mins) after 3 cups of coffee, no food or water and a 1km run. Had rapid, pounding heartbeat, violent shaking and sweating. This event scared me, probably making it worse, and so I called an ambulance. EMT's arrived after it was over, monitored me and told me to see a cardiologist about a potential case of SVT.  2. Had an EKG that day which showed evidence of MI, otherwise normal. Also the doctor detected a slight murmur.  3. Had another bout of tachycardia 4 days later. After this event (lasting ~ 2-3 mins) I was shaky and kept getting \"waves\" of an adrenaline-like rush with increased heartrate and subsequent shakiness and anxiety. This wouldn't go away and so I went into the emergency room where they performed another EKG (same as before with evidence of MI), took blood (all normal) and gave me ativan and released me, telling me to see a cardiologist for further testing. The emerg doctor suggested SVT as well.   4. Am waiting to see the cardiologist, but these \"waves\" of adrenaline and increased heart rate are frequent now with constant shakiness in between. I even woke out of a dead sleep last night with one of these episodes consisting of several waves of adrenaline and fast heartrate. I've also felt very mild pain in my chest and arm.   I'm finding it very difficult to continue with my normal life as a result of this and, after doing some research online, am wondering if the feelings I am having now are anxiety/panic related (I have no history of this) or related to the SVT.  Any help/advice would be appreciated.  Thanks and I'm sorry this is so long ... it's tough to give a brief history!\n\n",

If your insurance insists on your seeing one specific one, please call that office and tell them that you have a previous history of an MI (Myocardial Infarct), and that you need to be seen right away due to the symptoms you are now experiencing.  While it is unusual for one of your age to be having heart attacks, it is still a possibility that you have cardiac issues that need  to be addressed ASAP.

Three cups of coffee, no water, no food and a 1 k run is a good recipe for danger.  The fact that the EKG reveals that you have indeed already had a heart attack,which you apparently did not even know you had at the time of the occurrence, leads me to be concerned about your overall heart health, and the need for additional information to help protect yourself from further problems.  You have one heart, a long life potential ahead of you,  and a close family history of heart disease.  Please do not delay in seeking the appropriate physician to diagnose and provide the best treatment plan for you.\n\n",

    "title": "Constant small palpitations-what tests do I need?",
    "content": "Hi I'm a 21 year old female who has suffered from intermittent palpitations for many years.  I have seen a cardiologist recently, however, because they have increased in frequency.  I was given an ECG and a cardiomemo but no palpitations were recorded when I had them and the results were normal.  My symptoms seem to have worsened though.  I normally have one big skipped beat feeling and that is that but recently I have constantly had a very slight fluttering in my chest and throat which occasionally turns into a full on palpitation.  I havent ever blacked out and do not get out of breath without exercise and can exercise (although doing anything gives me a straining feeling.)  I feel worried that I have not been given other tests e.g. a stress test and wonder if I should push for this-what if they've missed something by not taking me seriously?  My mother suffers from palpitations.  I have not had any surgery and I am on not medication.  Is it possible that by thinking about my heart so much that I could be feeling something that is normal?  And would the ECG have shown anything really bad?  My heart rate is always irregular (fast when I breath in and slow when I breath out) is this normal and also it recently seems faster.  Any comments would be much appreciated as I have been going out of my mind, especially over the last week.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Josephine, There is a monitoring device called a Holter monitor that can be placed on you to measure your heart rate and heart rhythm over a course of 24 hours. This would be normally ordered by your cardiologist who would then read the results. This monitor, by being on you constantly for 24 hours during your normal daily activities, would record any abberancies in your rate or rhythm for further evaluation and/or treatment.  It is interesting that you have noticed the waxing and waning of your heart rate during breathing exercises.  There has been some studies that controlled breathing does impact the heart rate and can slow it.  Also, a contributing factor to an inconsistent heart rate and the feeling of palpitations is worry and stress.  We have a mechanism called a \"flight or fight syndrome\" in which our whole body goes into a heightened response to everything - to either flee the situation or to fight.  Part of that heightened response includes an increased heartrate and can be felt by some people as palpitations.  I commend you for being concerned and wishing to know the truth of your symptoms - especially since you have a family history of palpitations. But even a family history of a problem does not automatically doom you to the same problem.  Ask your doctor if a Holter Monitor is a possibility for you - and if and when true cardiac issues are ruled out, please put worry aside.\n\n",

You may wish to place a quick call to his/her office and ask them your question about exercise and activity.  If the reply is to do as you can tolerate, then  I encourage you to do so, and continue to monitor yourself.  As always, if the palpitations ever become pain, please present to the nearest emergency room, while the pain is there so an evaluation can be done during the problem.

    "content": "Dear Josephine, Did you take your pulse for an accurate count, or is the rate you mentioned a \"guesstimate\"?  If you know how to check your heart rate, it would be a good idea to do so when you think it is going abnormally fast (and yes 140 to 160 is pretty fast especially for a routine walk).  You can either check it at your neck by reaching across your throat and with two fingers gently feel for the pulse of what are known as your carotid arteries. By watching a second hand sweep on your clock or watch, count the rate for one full minute.   You can also find a pulse on the thumb side of your wrist, again by feeling gently right about the level where a bracelet or wristwatch band would be.  At your age about 70 to 90 would be fairly normal.  At a brisk walk possibly up to 120. Certainly 140 to 160 with a normal walk deserves closer attention and evaluation.  But it would help your physician to have a precise heart rate reported during times of rest, and exercise.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

My family  has a strong history of heart attcks, High blood pressure and irregular heratbeats. I am on Atenorol, dyazide and paxil. Recently in Nov i had a run of PVCs that lasted 4 entire days, all night and all day. I ahve had an EKG an  Echo. a Stress test and  as well as all my blood work, Now the PVCs are back again, this time lasting for 8 days now. They carry on all day, all night. They wake me up, prevent from sleeping and cause me much discomfort. I get tired and weak. They continue all day and night with very little brake. How can this many PVCs not be dangerous? It seems like my heart is not getting a break. I am worryed that one of these times my heart will not reset itself. I am scared. I called my Cardio and i am so tired of hearing that maybe it is stress. I am not stressed. I do not drink caffine. I do take fish oli and just bought Q10 to try that. Could my atenorol be causing them to get worse .I did have another halter monitor done and am awaiting the results but i am sure it will be in the 1000's . Please help i am at my wits end with these PVCS. I am thinking that there has got to be either a better medicine or somethimg else that can be done to control them to a managable amount. The weird thing is that i feel better when i am active such as cleaning, walking ect. PLease any advise would  be great. Thank you so much[/b]\n\n",

    "content": "Hello capricekid - FIrst of all, let's clarify what you mean by \"run of PVCs.\" I think I know, given the context, but it's important that we be on the same page. In medical circles a \"run\" of PVCs means three or more consecutive PVCs, which arbitrarily is considered ventricular tachycardia, a potential serious situation, and one rarely sustained for hours or days (although it can be). I suspect what you mean is frequent PVCs over a long perdiod of time. Please confirm  this is what you meant.   Now then: although you have a family history of heart disease, and are being treated for elevated blood pressure, it is important to understand that PVCs (and PACs - it is often impossible for the paitent to know for sure which is taking place) in and of themselves, are of virtually no clinical importance  nor diagnostic value. It is only of any significance when the patient  also has a damaged or weakened left ventrical wtih a low ejection fraction, something usually only seen in patients who have suffered an actual heart attack or who have markedly severe valvular dysfunciton. Everyone has PVCs at some time or another, and some are aware of every one while others don't notice them at all. They can  be very infrequent and random or they can occur very frequently or in group patterns (bigemeny, trigemeny, etc.). None  of this really matters, except in terms of the anxiety it may cause the  patient.   While people  plagued by perioids of many PVCs often aske if this cannot but be detrimental to the heart, the fact is that it is not. It feels awful but it doesn't do any damage nor does it put additonal wear and tear on  the heart.   Atenolol (and other beta blockers) can, in some cases, actually cause more rather than less PVCs because these drugs slow the resting rate and it is always easier for PVCs to slip in when the rate is slow (as at bedtime, after a substantial meal, etc.). Even so, this class of drug is virtually the only one chosen to \"treat\" PVCs, and usually they will reduce the  frequency of them - just not always. That  being said, it is probably more beneficial for you to be taking the Atenolol  right now,  and in no case should one ever abruptly discontinue use of a beta blocker, as this can cause far more problems (sometimes quite serious) than any the drug may be causing.   It has been learned, through bitter experience, that there is currently no antiarrhythmic drug, used in an outpatient setting, that is more effective (or even safe) for preventing or reducing PVCs.   The fact that you state you actually feel better when active is totally consistent with normal heart behavior as regards PVCs. Most often they will occur at rest and disappear  during exertion. This is a good sign and  suggests that although you tend  to have bouts of quite frequent PVCs, they are \"normal.\"   One other thing - that you probably don't want to hear: you state that you are \"not stressed\", and yet it would seem you are actually quite stressed over the frequency of the PVCs. Many people will deny stress is a factor because they do  not realize that feeling PVCs causes stress  related to the symptoms, and this causes yet more PVCs to occur. It doesn't mean you have generalized stress in your life. It means you  likely feel heightened anxiety (stress) when your heart starts doing these tricks. The only other medication that might be helpful in such a situatiion is one of the antianxiety drugs such as alprazolam (Xanax) or clonazepam (Klonopin) used temporarily,  in conjunction with the beta blocker. Clonazepam, in particular, has shown itself to be a useful adjunct in cases  where the patient experiences PVC-related anxiety. You might mention this to your doctor.   Trust me, your situation is very common and the  anxiety you feel when this happens is a form of stress. One of the benzodiazepine drugs (alprazolam or clonazepam) might well work in the short term to help quiet things down  a little.   I hope this provides you some peace of mind. This is a much more common problem than you might think. You're in good company.   Good luck to you and do stay in touch.\n\n",

There were 15 Superventricular Events 2 of them being couplets. my heart beat had 3 Bradcardia runs at 58 beats per minute and 60 beats per minute and 133 BpM once. My average was 84. . So that being said and you still tell me the same i will be a ease i promise. I do know what you mean by PVC Induced anixity. It sure does cause that so i take a xanex every once and a while to ease up on myself..I did just find out at the cardios office that my potassuim level was 34 in November and 33 now> So the doctor gave me 40mgls or something like that in liquid form and told  me to get re-tested in two weeks>. I was on Dyazide for 4 years and i have never been a big drinker of fluids so i guess i messed myself up doing that.No more Dyazide for me. Again Thanks for your reply and i lam looking forward to heraing back from you. Have a wonderful day\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again - Wow. That is a lot of stuff going on. It's that sort of thing that makes people really anxious and uncomfortable. It's a lot more than most people have for extended periods of time, but very good in that there were no actual \"runs\", just some couplets. The fact that your potassium level was low probably accounts for the extremely high number of premature beats. Now that you'll be taking the supplemental potassium for a while (40 meq to start sounds about right) you should see an improvement in the situation. They may not go away completely, but they should quiet down a good deal. When I saw you were on  Dyazide I assumed you'd been given a potassium supplement to go with that. I'm finding that often that isn't being done.   I can certainly empathize with you since that's really pretty much having it go on constantly during an extended period. Also, since some showed up in the form of bigemeny that is even more noticeable to some people, and can really feel unpleasant. (There are those who don't feel any of this stuff. I wish I knew how that worked). The occasional Xanax should help, and the potassium should really make a difference. As I've told others here with the same complaint, normally a potassium level of 3.3 or 3.4 would be only slightly low, but when associated with irregular heartbeats, most cardiologists like to see the potassium level around 4.0 instead. What you're taking should do that. It's important, as you've noted, to stay hydrated.   It sounds like you're probably on the way to some relief now. Please let us know how things work out for you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello donnalee - Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) often  eventually results in sinus arrest, which is one reason for the implantation of a pacemaker. If you had an ablation in  conjunction with SSS it was probably to ablate the AV jnode, which would make you pacemaker dependent. If your sinus node has failed and is no longer producing p waves this may well be a moot issue, and since your doctor didn't send you into the hosptial I think this would mean you don't need to be unduly concerned. It may mean, however, a possible adjustment in how the pacemaker should be set for optimum operation. If there was a cause for concern in this regard your cardiologist would have sent you to the hospital rather than home. With the pacemaker working the failed sinus node (if that is the case) could mean that the pacer needs to be set differently than it originally was, but you should not notice any real difference or new symptoms. (With atrial flutter there are far too many p waves anyway, so when something changes, the pacer can be optiimized for that situation).   Please do keep in touch and let us know what you learn.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello pumpkiin - There appear to be at least two things going on at once here, and the lesser one is the palpitation issue. When a paitent presents with a primary complaint of palpitations and a low potassium level the doctor is going to want to correct the potassium deficiency and keep it at around 4.0, which you have succeeded in doing. If the palpitations then continue, they can most likely be considered normal or at least secondary to an underlying cause. We all have some premature beats from time to time and some of us have them nearly all the time. If the potassium issue is resolved then palpitations lose some of their initial importance. Since you have been suffering from loose stools and frequent urination among your other symptoms, these were the likely route of potassium loss to begin with. If these symptoms have continued since, the excess molitlity in your lower GI tract could be causing the continued palpaitions. This is not, in itself, a cause for concern, and is common. However, it is not normal to have loose stools, excessive urination, joint aches and pains and lethargy for months at a time, and that is the real issue of concern now that the potassium issue has been managed.   There are any number of conditions which could be causing your ongoing discomfort, and it would require a thorough exam and some additional testing to hopefully figure out what it is. It could be anything from a persistent enterovirus to mononucleosis to chronic fatigue sydrome to acute hepatitis type C, to name just a few, from the less serious to the moreso.   Whatever is going on needs to be addressed, and that can only be accomplished via a comprehensive workup by a general practitioner or internist. Meanwhile, don't discontinue the potassium supplements so long as the other symptoms are present.  Hopefully this is something fairly simple that will run its course, but it would be helpful to at least have it treated symptomatically so that you could feel better. Absolutely do not give up on resolving this!  Good luck to you and do stay in touch.\n\n",

I have only had a CBC and a Ct Scan.  I was told that every thing on my Ct scan was fine.  I have a 15mm cyst on my kidney and small cysts on my liver.  Im having a hard time believing my Dr. She is unconcerned.  This has been going on for about 2 yrs.  I don't beleive it is hepatitus C due to the fact I wouldnt have a clue as to how I would contract it. I am 32 yr old female.  Any other suggestions?\n\n",

It's unfortunate that your present doctor doesn't seem to be too interested in connecting the dots with you, especially since this has been going on so long.

I didn't mean to suggest Hep C as a likely cause, just something on one end of the spectrum of possibilities that could cause this sort of syndrome. Of course one can contract Hep C any number of ways, most of them quite innnocent. Still, it was just one possibility.   The only thing I can suggest so far as getting the workup you need to get to the bottom of this is something I encourage a good deal anyway, and that is that we each need to be our own patient advocate and sometimes that means confronting a doctor with our problem and throwing down the gauntlet. It goes without saying not every doctor will pick it up, and there's no law saying anyone has to, but if one won't then perhaps it's time to go out of network or do something else unconventional.

In the meantime I'm going to do some hard thinking and see if I can come up with any ideas more specific to the symptoms and information you've provided. There's no reason anyone should have to feel badly and not at the very least know why. Meanwhile hang in there and, if possible, force the issue.

Oh I didnt care that you suggested Hep C.  I just meant to say I have had no blood contact and I have only been with one partner(my husband)  and we have been faithful for 13 yrs. I just would suspect something would have come up before now=)  Of course I only know what I recently read through on the internet.   I think you are an extremely caring and insightful person.  I would appreciate any thoughts you have.   Would you suggest I take my Ct scan into another Dr.?  What other tests can I ask for?   Thank you so much for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again - No, I could have put that more delicately, foor instance could have just used \"hepatitis\" and left it at that. Any type of hepititis could cause similar symptoms, but Hep-C can remain dormant and asymptomatic for many years, which  is why it occurred to me. Hep-A could  cause the same symptoms, but rarely becomes chronic so that it would last several years (although that can happen).   All that leads me to answer your question about what tests to request (and you shouldn't really have to do that thinking  for a doctor, but obviously it can happen), and while most any doctor would  at least order a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and a CBC, I would think some enzymes might be  checked as well as a hepatitis panel and liver function tests, just to clear the liver of any possible  role in the problem.   I also would definitely take  the CT films to another doctor, preferably an internist, because while a second opiinion is never a bad idea, it is a very good idea when  you can't even  get a first opinion, as seems to be the case with the doctor you've been dealing with.   Thanks  for your very kind words, and I do hope you are able to find someone  who can get to the bottom of this so that you can start feeling better sooner than  later.   Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I am currently on flecainde acetate 100 mg twice a day for Ectopic Atrial Tachycardia.  Recently I also started taking Lamisil to treat a nail infection in my thumb.  When I started the Lamisil, my doctor decreased my Flecainde dose to 50 mg twice a day.  However, this dose is ineffective in treating the arrhythmia.  I tried taking propranolol to help, and it works, but it makes me very tired and depressed.  So I called my doctor, and he said I could try the 100 mg twice a day, but to have an EKG done a couple weeks after starting back.  My question is this: The side effects from the flecainde (in my case, mild vision problems and my tongue goes slightly numb) seem to be a little stronger, and last longer than usual.  Also, I can feel some electrical things going on at times when I'm normally fine.  Is there some sort of negative reaction going on?  And if my regular side effects are inensified, could  there be other things going on?  If there were an electrical problem based on drug interactions, how would I know if it's that, instead of just the EAT that I already have?  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

It appears that in your case, the decrease was too little of a dose, but the increased dose was leading to side effects.  Your side effects may actually be from the Lamisil rather than the flecainide.  Lamisil is reported to cause some taste changes and vision changes.  You may wish to talk with your doctor about a different medication to treat your nail infection.  Regarding the electrical problems, if you experience any abnormal feeling symptoms such as palpitations (rapid heart rate), chest pain, etc. you should be evaluated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am writing to you from New Zealand. My husband Stu age 42 has been diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome. He was cardioverted feb 05 for atrial flutter and then he had a pacemaker installed Jan 06 for bradycardia. For the past 6 months he has been becoming more and more tired and breathless, with his heart racing and the pacer tech saying he back in atrial flutter. He is on the list for ablation but this is 6-12 month s away from being done. The doctors put him on diltiazem 120mg 4 weeks ago and he has not noticed any improvement in his condition, He is also on warfarin for his INR levels. He has been hospitlaized 3 times in the last month due to passing out and breathlessness. We are 1.5 hours away from a hospital and at least 1 hour away from ambulance service. It all makes having him at home a very stressful thing. I work long hours and spend my time worried about leaving him with our 12 year old son.  His echocardiogram has the following abbreviations on it.  LV normal size, systolic function mildly impaired, dysynchronous contraction (PPM), apex appears hypokinetic, though this may be due to PPM, borderline LVH, values normal, trace MR, LA mildly enlarged, RV normal size, good systolic function, trace MR. What does all this mean I have had a nurse tell me it means he expereincing heart failure. I am concerned as to what his outlook is and whether we should be trying to raise funds ourselves for ablation treatment instead of waiting for his name to come up on the public waiting list. I appreciate your knowledge on this condition. Regards Donna\n\n",

    "content": "Your husband's condition is a little concerning.  Often, atrial flutter is not a serious issue.  Blood thinners are recommended (warfarin) to prevent clots from forming in the atria that are not contracting normally.  In your husband's case, it appears that he has a component termed rapid ventricular response.  In this condition the signals for the atrial flutter are being transmitted and causing the ventricles to fire as well.  This rapid ventricular rate wears on the muscle, resulting ultimately in heart failure.  The rapid beating can also interfere with proper blood filling of the heart causing reduced blood circulation.  This is likely the cause of your husband's passing out.  His echocardiogram results indicate a mild amount of heart failure (most likely interpretation).    The pacemaker will help keep his heart from beating too slow; however, it does nothing for rapid heart rates.  There are devices that can be implanted to cardiovert when a particular rhythm occurs.  Your husband may need one of these.  An ablation will likely help stop the ventricles from responding to the atrial fluter and help resolve his problems with racing heart beats.    I am unfamiliar with New Zealand's health care process regarding whether or not the procedure can be done sooner.  Follow up with his cardiologist is essential.  There may be other medications that he can use to help control his symptoms as well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Donna, The heart is actually two pumps in one:   the upper called the atria, and the bottom called the ventricles.  They are supposed to work synergistically with a \"general\" in the upper one called the Sinus Node calling a cadence, as if it were a marching band: \"march March! march MARCH!\". When the general gets sick you can have a \"sick sinus syndrome\", and you end up with more of a Jazz band.  When the band is too slow, the pacemaker your husband has will pick up the pace and make the heart beat more effective. When the band goes too fast, he can pass out because there is not enough passive fill of the ventricles from the crippled atria to feed the brain and other organs.  The following link has a good general map of the important aspects of the heart you are concerned about.       http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art ... lekey=2407 Also: the reason your husband is on coumadin is to inhibit the formation of blood clots that can occur in the atria during dysrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Consider an eddy attached to a brook, and visualize a leaf floating in it around and around until a poof of wind causes it to join the mainstream.  An atrial dysrhythmia can cause a similar \"eddy\" and cause the blood that stalls and goes \"round and round\" to become a clot. Then this clot can suddenly join the mainstream blood flow and travel to the brain or heart or kidneys - anywhere!  It would be wise if your husband limits his activity and stress until you both and his doctor together determine the best course of treatment for him.   FYI:  LV=left ventricle, PPM=permanent pacemaker, MR=mitral regurgitation, LA=left atrium, RV=right ventricle. As the good doctor said, I am also not acquainted with your country's healthcare process.  Please continue to coordinate his care with his primary physician and heart specialist.\n\n",

I don't take coffee after lunchtime and only drink decaff teas in the afternoon.  I have had palpitations on a previous occasion but from irregular diet.  I have been taking a digestive supplement recently, but have never had a problem with this before.  My parents don't have heart problems at all but my grandparents did.

    "content": "Dear Suze,  In addition to what the good doctor stated in the previous post I would like to share some observations I have made over the years. You did not mention what kind of digestive supplement you are taking. Some seemingly innocuous OTC (over the counter) supplements known as nutraceuticals may inadvertently contribute to potential problems. A nutraceutical is not evaluated nor listed as either approved or disapproved by the FDA. It is a classification by itself and usually refers to an ingestible or topical substance that has some sort of \"natural\" effect on human health. If the digestive supplement you are taking causes you to have more stools than normal, it is possible that it can impact your natural chemistry. Potassium is a very important metal in your body, it is particularly valuable to heart health. There are some conditions of the heart that are noticeably impacted by too much or too little potassium (and other minerals also such as sodium, magnesium, calcium, etc.) These levels can be impacted by our lifestyle, diet habits, and other \"medicines\" we may take.   Dr. Mokhtar recommended you see your doctor and I agree. You may wish to also consider getting lab work done which will easily tell if your chemistry is normal.  I would also suggest you use some introspection, and see if you may be having some unusually stressful situations in your life right now that may be causing you some anxiety. This too can cause the feelings you describe.\n\n",

Usually, if there is no organic heart disease, infrequent pacs or pvcs are not treated unless the patient has annoying palpitations so they are given a small dose of beta blockers to help with the sensation of palpitation.  i think your heart doctor might ask you for a stress test if she/he thinks that you might have coronary disease, but i doubt this since you are a young female.  Now if you have a lot of stress, this might be the reason behind it.  You have to quit smoking if you are, have caffeine intake taken down to a minimum or stop caffeine intake as well.

    "content": "Dear xkatiex - You actually sound very normal. Those \"missing\" beats are actually premature ones and almost everyone has them at some time or another. Some people have them almost constantly. They are a very common source of anxiety and worry, but they also can be caused by anxiety and worry, so it's a difficult cycle to break.   The premature beats are rarely, if ever, diagnostic of anything, but they can cause an awful lot of concern for the person having them. A conscious effort to ignore them only helps to focus attention on them, so it is an ironic problem. The best thing is to allow yourself to become absorbed in something else and with luck you won't notice them as much. Oddly, some people have hundreds per day but don't feel them, while other people only have a very few, but feel every one.   The chest pain has been diagnosed as Tietz' Syndrome, so that is fine. It may respond to a low dose of something like Tylenol, but is not cardiac related at all, and since you are active and a dancer, you probably put your upper body through more contortions than you realize, which can cause or aggravate that problem. Any chest pain that is worsened by movement or pressing with your finger is not heart-related. So you can let that one go. It will usually resolve on its own, but if not, then taking it easy on the affected body part may help.   The Holter monitor (24 hour EKG you mentioned) should give you a lot of peace of mind once it becomes available for you to use.   You didn't mention how tall you are or your weight, nor did you happen to mention how fast your heart rate was at the hospital, but some sinus (normal) tachycardia is normal for young females, especially if they are hyper to begin with, and moreso if they are petite or thin. The fact that you acknowlege being stress-prone and a worrier also plays into that.   You sound like a normal, healthy young woman who is tuned in to her body perhaps a little more than you need to be. It's hard not to once you've become aware of your own heart's beating, but again, do try and let yourself be distracted by other, more enjoyable things. And do update us when you finally get to have to 24 hour EKG.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi xkatiex - I apologize for being so late in replying to your most recent post. You sound like you are doing somewhat better now. Your rate of 110 to 140, for a young and hyper person is not really surprising if you feel stressed at those times. And yes, it is extremely common for people to have palpitations at bedtime, as the body is trying to slow down. The \"braking\" system isn't perfect, and the heart can sometimes \"backfire\" when told to slow down and rest. The fact that you have palpitations when active (out and about) is not a bad thing in itself, no, as some people just have them at random. If you were to be having a constant, extremely rapid rate, along with symptoms such as lightheadedness, etc., then you conceivably could be having supreventricular tachycardia (SVT) which is not life-threatening either, but is also often correctable. You sound, though, like a fairly normal teenage female with some stress issues and a heart that tends to run a little fast, rather than a little slow.   We'll look forward to hearing what your Holter monitor test shows. Meanwhile I hope you are enjoying life.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - At your age it's not unusual to get lightheaded on standing up, but it shouldn't happen all the time. Did this happen in conjunction with the skipped beats? Sometimes you can get every other beat being a premature beat and that can cause some people to feel lightheaded briefly, but most of the time it's due to having been seated or lying down for a while then getting up and it takes a second or two for your heart to realize you've changed position. The blood needs to stay in your head to stay conscious, and when you stand, especially in your age group when the body is still adjusting to its size or you're still growing, you can sometimes take your heart by surprise by getting up too quickly and it has to beat harder and faster to keep the blood up there in your brain so you don't fall down. If it happens real often it's worth looking into, but it's pretty normal if it just  happens on occasion.   Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "Flip flops,extra beats....SCD!!??",
    "content": "Hi, im a 31yr old male. No real prior heart issues except a mummur when i was born that disapeared by age 4or 5. I have no family history of heart disease that i know of. One grand parent died of a heart attack at 78 but she was life long diabetic.I currently have two grand parent in there 80\"s doing quite well.I do not have high blood pressure, i have gotten my lipids under control by diet and exersise and are in a healthy range. I am a testicular cancer survivor of 61/2 years and a migraine with aura sufferer. I get a handfu a yearl of mirgaines/w aura no pain or low grade headache  and just feel like crap for a couple of days aftert and treat them with OTC . As i entered my 20's i started to notice these funny little flip flops in the chest every now and then. But I seem to get them more frequntly now. I do suffer from a bit of anxiety. After the cancer  I have become very,very aware of all my body's idiosycrocies and have a tendency to be a bit pschyosimatic. I have always been a bit on the heavy side. I was an over wieight teen ( nothing crazy) but very active in sports. As i got into my 20's i statred to get heavier and less active. I was diagnosed with testicualr cancer at 23 by 25 i had balloned to 265lbs and am only 5'9. I got motivated lost 65 pound and became an avide runner. With my new found passion i started entering races and small marathons. Concered with these funny heart beat i went to a well respected Cardiologist.I told him my symptoms, as i was a little concered about pushing myself phyically as far as my heart was concerend. And i heard about people getting sudden cardiac death from undiagnosed heart issues. I was given a EKG, ECHO and EXERSISE stress test. All came back great, the dotor told me i had nothing to fear be as active as i want. I believe him and after reading a few the other posts decribing what i have it's  put at ease a bit. HOWEVER, i am still concerned. I still get the flip flops, or extra beats. I can go weeks with out them and then get one in a day and not for weeks again or can get them all  day. I can't get it out of my head and it worries me to push my self because im scared of Sudden Cardiac death or heart attack. Which truth be told i know little to nothing about! Is it really just a simple as i have been told and is nothing to worry about. I usuallly run about 20-25 miles a week and weight train 3 days a week. I know you have to trust you DR. and i do but i guess i need a little more clarification on what is actually going on and why. I undersand you can only get so much out of an e-mail but can you shead a little more light on what is going on to me. So I have a better understanding. This way when it happens i can rationalize my thoughts. AND what causes SCD i hear about these young adults or kids just colapsings and dying. Medication wise i take ativan as needed for anxiety and sleep. A perscription of 50 lasts me a year with some to spare. It moslty treats my stressful cancer follow up screenings which leave me a bit stressed out as im sure you can understand. Thanks for the info! your all fantastic for particapating in this site.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello The Saint - FIrst  of all, as you've probably noticed here on the forum, you are in very good company. There are a lot of people with benign PVCs and other sorts of blips and ireeguarities who are also concerned about them. The up side of that is that, as you've already read here, these things are virtually never a matter of medical concern. They can, however, be of major emotional significance. I suspect most people who become aware of their hearts' behavior, especially when there is an occasional misfire, feel the same concerns you have expressed in your post.  Here's the thing about SCD: usually those conditions which predispose to it are easily detected, provided an individual with reason to be concerned brings this concern to the attention of his doctor. There is usually some  telling family history (often very remarkable), and there are almost always very clear markers for those at risk for SCD. You (and your doctor) appear to have done  everything reasonable to rule out any risk of SCD.   Again, please bear in mind that just about everyone has at least an occasional PVC or PAC. Some people have huge numbers of them (I mean like thousands in a 24 hour period) and being otherwise healthy and  without any markers  for risk of SCD, have no medical cause for concern.  I repeat, we all have some, and some have many.   As a person who was heavy (\"stout\" might be the word that applies here) and athletic as well, it was wise  for you to have yourself screened for any potential problems, as those with certain  structural abnormalities can increase the severity of them by their athletic conditioning. Not every \"stout\" athlete, obviously,  has a problem - a few do here and there - and you clearly are not one of them. For athletes, even those who are not \"stout\", it is wise to have a one-time screening (with EKG and echocardiogram) just to be certain there is nothing funny going on inside. Youve done that.   There are some electrical problems that are also very commonly genetic (inheriited) and there is usually some family history. These are readily picked up on a single 12-lead EKG.   You defiinitely have, with your cardiologist's careful workup, ruled out any prone-ness to SCD. The possibility, having done that, becomes,  for you, virtually nil.   While you have zero risk factors for SCD,  and only the usual oes (male, \"stout\") for  future coronary artery disease (whcih can  be headed off in part by having your cholesterol checked and  kept in line if necessary), making you a very fortunate person, you also have a negative family history,  in that there  is  no premature heart disease evident, and people are living into their 80's (with the exception of your grandmother, who still lived a pretty long time considering she   was diabetic). This  is actually considered a protective trait.   Based on the information you've provided about your own health and your family history, you would be classified as at no risk for SCD, and low-risk for coronary artery disease. You are truly a  specimen!   What you do have working against you is anxiety and your own awareness of your body, which is not only a very common thing but in your case has some  medical basis, since you've been through a pretty scary non-cardiac event and come out the other side! Congratulations on  having beat the cancer and  as for your heart, you really are among the  chosen few who can  rest  easy and are at the very bottom of the risk ladder.   I hope this helps  put your mind at ease. There are definite markers  for SCD and you didn't have any! Something else to celebrate!\n\n",

It's useful to be in tune with one's body; it's just easier for some of us to shut out the useless information it gives us. I'm betting you'll slowly get better at weeding out the static from the significant stuff with time.

    "content": "Hi,  I'm a 34 year old woman, was diagnosed with MVP  with trivial mitral regurgitation in my teens. never had any problems with my heart until quite recently when I had an episode, where my heart rate, while I was sitting still at rest, suddenly increased to 180 bpm. I was concerned and went to the ladies rest room to try holding my breath, and coughing to try to slow my heart rate down but it didn't work. After climbing a short flight of stairs to exit the ladies restroom, my heart rate increased further to about 210 bpm.  By this time, I was feeling lightheaded and had to sit down. I managed to get to lunch and to walk around a bit, though I was still feeling a little faint. My heart continued to race at the same speed all throughout and continued for the next 3 hours. Then it suddenly slowed down to a normal pace.  By this time, I was exhausted.   I've encountered a couple more episodes since then, though none lasting as long as the 3 hour episode. They tend to be infrequent.   In addition, I've noticed that I've had more episodes of tightness in the chest and of breathlessness, to the point where I've had to cough, to try to relieve the symptoms. And the fingers on my right hand sometimes feel a little numb.  Moreover, after I exercise, I notice that my heart tends to skip beats.  I've undergone a holter monitoring before, but it didn't pick up anything. Should I even bother undergoing some more tests? I don't want any unnecesary medical expenses. Are there any risks involved with just leaving it as it is?  The only family history of heart disease is in my maternal grandfather who had high blood pressure, and my mother who has high blood pressure. I don't have high blood pressure. I'm not taking any medications.  Any advice would be appreciated.   Thank you for reading, and thank you for your time :)\n\n",

Heart rates that suddenly jump to a speed of 180 or more (as if a light switch had been flipped) then just as suddenly jump back down to normal are very suspicious of SVT.  I would recommend that you discuss this with your doctor.  SVT can be a little difficult to diagnose with EKG's because inbetween events the heart may be normal.  You may benefit from a holter monitor if the events are happening fairly regularly or an event monitor if the events are more rare.  A holter monitor may help elicit the etiology of your \"missed beats\" also.  Hope this helps.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi catamaran - While waiting for Dr. Lowe's response I think I can answer this for you. In an otherwise young and healthy person SVT (which is very likely what you experienced) is not life-threatening. It can be very disruptive, however, and once documented, can be treated and/or elimiinated.   In the meantime, until the diagnosis has been made definite via a recording device, it would probably be wise to cease vigorous activity during an episode (and your natural impulse would likely be to stop). This is usually a self-limiting arrhythmia, and it generally causes people to stop what they're doing or at least slow down. Since the heart is already going just about as fast as it theoretically is able, you won't put it into overdrive, but vigorous activity, if it still seems feasible, could build up an oxygen debt which might cause you to faint and injure yourself. That's about the only risk involved with SVT.   The prudent thing would be to first determine for certain the arrhythmia is SVT (I'd put money on it, but that's not how medicine is practiced), learn to manage it or begin a course of treatment to control or eliiminate it, and then resume life as per usual.   Please do stay in touch!\n\n",

The first step you want to take is to confirm that this is actually what is going on.  SVT is generally not an incredibly serious complication but there are some other dysrhythmias that have more risks associated with them that can cause rapid heart rates.  Not many of these can produce heart rates in the 200's though.    If you have any other questions please feel free to post again.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi borninlbc - The short answer to your question is an unqualified yes. The fact that it can, and often does, is in itself not important unless the palpitations are bothersome, in which case one could simply take a pass on the alcohol.   However, there is a different phenomenon that can occur at times. When a person drinks more, or more often, than usual (as often takes place during the holidays in the US) some people find themselves with an abnormal rhythm called atrial fibrillation. This is usually temporary, resolving on its own (the phenomenon has come to be referred to as \"holiday heart\" in some circles) but if it doesn't self-correct very quickly, it should be brought to the attention of a doctor, as atrial fibrillation, while not dangerous in its own right, can permit the formation of clots in the upper chambers of the heart, which then can be discharged into the bloodstream, reach the brain, block a vessel there and cause a stroke.   Most people who drink occasionally rarely, if ever, have this happen. Chronic abusers of alcohol often do.   If you or someone you know experiences occasional \"flip flops\" or \"skips\" during or after consumption of moderate amounts of alcohol, this is not a cause for concern. If one experiences a sustained (for hours or days) fluttering or full sensation in the chest,  it is worth looking into. But most drinkers will experience occasional premature beats as a result of even light alcohol consumption.   Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello creg - You do seem to have a lot going on, and it is not unreasonable to feel some anxiety or at least concern about symptoms which limit one's activity or disrupt life, even if only on occasion. That being said, it is difficult, especially in matters such as you have described, to separate heart and head. We all have very visceral and emotional responses to misbehavior of the heart. It's almost impossible to avoid. The trick is in finding out just what is going on and then learn to cope with it if it is, indeed, benign.   Some of the things you've described could definitely be caused by hemolytic anemia, but then it would be essential to find the underlying cause (if there is one - sometimes the disease is what is known as \"essential\", that is, exists for no other reason but usually there is one) and work to correct it. That would normally involve taking folic acid and possibly steroids. In fact, the dramatic episodes you describe do sound like hemolytic crises, so I'm puzzled as to why nothing more has been done to rule that in/out and possibly treat it.  All anemias can also cause more than the occasional premature heartbeats (PVCs), so this also plays into the HA possibility.  The problem is that whatever you're feeling, the feelings are real, and they are rarely only in someone's head. The real question is: Are they significant or not? While the premature beats are not, the rest may well be. The premature beats will, however, bring the head into the game and can cause significant anxiety. In this case that may be a good thing, as it is forcing you to bring the whole bag of symptoms to the attention of doctors. It's important that the low hemoglobin count be accounted for, and simply telling you that \"ladies at [your] age can feel like this\" is hardly the kind of reasurrance you're looking for right now.   It sounds as though you'll need to be persistent in order to get to the bottom of this. If the pills they gave you helped they perhaps were folic acid and/or B6?   Premature heartbeats are virtually always benign, but they can cause anxiety and they can increase in frequency during periods of anemia. Given that your hemoglobin levels have been low enough to warrant some sort of treatment, further exploration is in order so that you can feel better and be truly reassured. Keep after them for answers, and please do keep us updated.\n\n",

You are right in thinking i have had folic acid and have had regular tests  since to keep a check on the aneamia, last test the levels was 14 so no real worries  there, what i would like to know is , that by having heamotolic aneamia for so long untreated do you think its possible that it could have afected my heart rythem, and now its something i have just got to live with, i have returned to the doctors and they say that i have had lots of exstensive tests done on the heart so i should be reasurred .  i have recently looked at hypothyroidism a Dr skinner said that although you can have a normal thyroid test some people can still have all the symptoms of this condition and respond well to a drug called thyroxin, this Doctor is a private practice and  i have visited him to disscuss and he seemed to think i am a classic case, so what are you waiting for then , i can hear you say well i am am not the sort of person to jump in and take precribed drugs without further findings although my own doctor did refere me, he seemed sceptical, so hence the postings on this site. i might add that the palpatations missed beats although  now every day most of the day they only used to appear just before a period making me think that it was related to hormones anyway  i will vist the doctor again and let you know what if anything is said, thanks again for your time j\n\n",

    "content": "Hi creg - You are quite welcome. It sounds like the folic acid is doing its job, and you have gotten reassuring results back from all the heart tests. As to your question about prolonged anemia causing your heart to become irritable, well, no, not really. Once the situation is corrected there's rarely any damage to the muscle. However, for a lot of people, once PVCs have started, it's like the heart has learned a new \"trick\" and wants to do it some more. Whatever triggers them to begin with (and the list of possible triggers is longer than you'd want to try and read here) seems to open the door and it really doesn't mean much in terms of the health of the heart, but it can cause quite a bit of consternation in the person having them, which of course liberates a certain amount of adrenaline in response to the stress or anxiety, and that is one of those triggers. So in time it will probably settle down.   Taken by themselves, PVCs have very little medical significance. However, by their very nature they make us nervous, so that often is all it takes to make them happen more. It's a real feat trying not to think about a thing - usually brings our mind right to focus on the thing we're trying to not think about - so the best approach is to just accept the benign nature of them and try your best to ignore them. There are medications that can make them less frequent, but if there's a possibility of hypothyroidism you might not want to try one of those until that is ruled out, as the most commonly-prescribed class of drugs can exacerbate some of the symptoms of hypothyroid. By the same token, synthetic thyroid, if that becomes an issue, can sometimes also cause premature beats, although if regulated correctly this should be a minimal issue at best.  Your observation that palpitations often seem to increase just prior to (and sometimes during) a woman's period is correct, too. Just one more of the hundred-odd things that can set them off.   Please do let us know what comes of the next doctor visit, and good luck to you!\n\n",

For the last six months or so I have been having mild chest flutterings with shortness of breath and dizziness.  I looked it up online and read that many healthy adults experience this from time-to-time and that usually it is not a big deal so I put it out of my head.     Then, yesterday while riding the bus I suddenly got nauseous and felt very hot and was instantly washed in sweat.  It felt like my heart was quivering in my chest.  I was very dizzy and feared I would pass out, vomit, or both.  I was very breathless and my hands and feet started tingling and my pulse was racing.  After about five minutes it all passed and I got home without further incident.  For about three hours after the attack I felt very weak and shaky.   One cup of coffee first thing in the morning is the extent of my caffeine intake and this happened at about 6pm.  I have no history on mental illness or anxiety.\n\n",

    "content": "Abrupt onset of a rapid heart rate followed by an almost as abrupt end can often be the sign of a heart dysrhythmia known as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).    If the episodes are few and far between it can be difficult to diagnose SVT.  Diagnosis hinges on \"catching\" one of the episodes on paper.  To accomplish this, many cardiologists will first do an EKG.  This may show some predisposing signs to SVT, such as the presence of a syndrome called Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.  If the EKG is normal, you can be set up with a holter monitor that is a 24-72 hour continuous recording EKG.  If the episodes are not that predictable an event recorder can be used.  With this device you press a button when you feel the symptoms and it records the EKG for the recent time period.  The advantage to this is that it can be worn for longer periods of time.  Talking with your doctor is the first step.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 42-year-old female who is having a problem with arrhythmia.  When I get these palpitations and flutterings, they don't last for just a couple of seconds - the one I'm currently experiencing has been going on for almost 3 hours now.  It's always accompanied by pressure in my chest which may or may not make its way to my shoulder or arm.  Many times, there is a point where I experience sharp pains. Only a couple of times has any pain or pressure reacyed my neck area. This \"epidsode\" is also always accompanied by light-headedness and on times that I've actually gone to the hospital for it, my blood pressure has been off the charts.  I've been having this problem for a couple of years now and have had EKG's, stress tests, ultrasounds on my heart, worn a Holter monitor, and carried around a device which I had to hold to my chest during each \"episode\" and which transmitted an EKG directly to my doctor.  My biggest concern with all of this is that  some of the tests show that there is already damage to my heart and some show nothing.  Generally, when these episodes occur, I'm pretty basically doing nothing - reading, watching TV, sewing or sleeping.  Any clues?  I've been to 5 doctors about this already - 3 are cardiologists and I'm just getting to the point that I'm so fed up that I don't want to go anymore.  There is a history of heart disease on both sides of my family and right now, I'm not taking any medications at all.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear gettingfedup - Your screen name says it all. This sort of thing can be very frustrating. A big part of the problem is a failure of the doctor to explain clearly to the patient what is going on and why he is not concerned about it. Now you have seen five doctors about this problem, three of them cardiologists, and yet you are not on any medication. Clearly no one has found anything they feel is life-threatening, but just as clearly, no one has explained, to your satisfaction, what is going on and why.   You mention that the \"episode\" going on when you placed your post had been going on for three hours. We need to get clear on what you percieve as an episode. One can have an arrhythmia that is non-stop, rapid or regularly irregular, for hours. However, if you are having, instead, frequent premature beats, this would not be considered a single episode, but rather an \"interlude\" during which you experienced a great many premature beats but not a treatable rapid or irregular heartbeat. I know, it can be confusing, because having premature beats (either premature atrial or ventricular contractions) is technically an \"irregular\" heart rhythm, but it is made up of a collection of frequent but individual beats. I suspect this is what is happening, and is why no one has expressed concern. The fact is, almost all premature heartbeats, no matter how frequent they are (unless they become strung together into a sustained, rapid tachyarrhythmia), are benign and doctors would prefer to not treat them. However, if they are causing acute anxiety and unnecessary worry to the extent that they are affecting one's ability to function and enjoy life, then a doctor may prescribe a beta blocker to reduce the frequency of the \"bips.\"  You've had virtually every appropriate diagnostic procedure, yet it appears no one has explained the problem iin a way that makes you comfortable. This shouldn't be that difficult.  One thing you said which makes the frequent premature beat scenario all the more likely is that it almost always happens when you are not active. This is extremely common with Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) and they tend to go away when one gets up and starts moving around. Also, despite what I said about continuous arrhythmias, as always there is the exception which proves the rule, and you may be experiencing what is called bigemeny, which is quite common and does form a sort of \"episode\" at times - can go on for hours or days, even - and yet is really every other beat being a premature one, and is not technically a true arrhythmia, at least not in the strict sense. Bigemeny, when in the form of PVCs, tends to perpetuate itself, especially when the subject is sitting relatively still. Every other beat is premature, and this often can cause painful sensations, especially when the premature beat occurs while the tricuspid valve of the heart happens to be closed.   The fact that there is a history of heart disease on both sides of your family is good reason to be concerned and to see a doctor about the problem; However, PVCs are almost never diagnostically significant. Once they start, if the patient is sufficiently aware of them, this causes anticipatory anxiety which can, in and of itself, trigger yet more premature beats. It becomes a cycle that is ever more worrisome for the patient and frustrating for the doctor.   You mentioned that some of your EKGs have shown some \"damage\" to your heart while others do not. True heart muscle damage does not go away (for instance, if one has had a heart attack the scar and the attendant EKG changes do not disappear, although they do change with time, up to a certain point - then they remain the same). On the other hand, most EKG machines which are programmed to interpret the tracings will occasionally misread or misinterpret abnormalities or \"see\" things that aren't there, which is why a doctor must read the tracings and decide whether the finding is \"true\" or not. (By the way, this occurs more frequently in women than in men).  If there were any definite damage to your heart muscle someone would by now have told you, suggested a course of treatment or management, and you would definitely be on some form of medication.   I strongly suspect you are one of the many people who, when quiet, start to have PVCs, perhaps in a group pattern, which can go on for hours and feel very disturbing. Again, these are almost always benign, so the challenge is how to break the cycle, to reduce the frequency of the ectopic beats and/or to reduce the patient's concern. I have to fault at least one of the doctors you've seen for not taking the time to explain the problem and offer some palliative agent such as a beta blocker or anti-anxiety agent.   You sound like a healthy young woman with a \"normal\" abnormality which really troubles you when you are aware of it. It is a very common complaint, and there are things that can sometimes help make it less troublesome. I would narrow the field down  to one doctor you feel most comfortable with and ask if he or she can offer something more than a rerun of the tests you've already had. A sympathetic ear can sometimes work wonders.  I hope this has been of some help and reassurance to you. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

First, when medical people refer to \"extra\" beats they actually mean \"extra\" in the sense of a place of origin outside the normal pathway (as in \"external\" and not \"additional\" beats). This is a fine distinction but is helpful to know because these \"extra\" or premature beats are almost always followed by a pause that compensates for their prematurity, and  so helps to maintain the normal underlying rhythm.   I believe you may have posted about your child in another thread, as I recall discussing Long QT in a nine year old with a family history. There was mention that time  of  a possible junctional  escape  rhythm. While p-waves are rarely seen in junctional complexes, if they are present at all they usually will show up in the wrong place, as you describe, suggesting  a dissociation between the sinus node and the pathway below it.    I think it would help avoid confusion if we could keep this all in the oriiginal thread, so that there is continuity of the  exchange of information. I hope you will let us know when the adrenaline  challenge test has been done and what the findings are, but please post it in your original thread so we don't lose track of you. Thanks for your help with this and we look forward to hearing how things unfold.\n\n",

    "content": "Okay, I will keep all my questions in this thread. I understand about the escape rhythms but I was just wondering if the extra beat the doctor was talking about was the R-on-T Phenomenon that I have read about. On his ECG it is a QRS thing near the top of his T wave and is visible in the V1, V2, V3, and lead II in the rhythm strip at the bottom. The doctor said that this is usually pretty rare in children and that he would let the specialists see it when they did the challenge test. I have 2 boys, aged 9 and 19 that are getting the test done. My 19 year old had a cardiac arrest about 9 months ago during an apparent asthma attack. They now believe it could be Long QT Syndrome as well for him. Since we live about 900 km from the hospital where they do the testing they are trying to coordinate for both boys to be done at the same time using pediatric and regular cardiologists, so it could take a while at this time of year to set it up. That is why I have so many questions, I am getting anxious. Thanks for your time, Stevie\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again stevie13wonder - No need to apologize. It just helps keep track of a given issue when the questions are in a row.   As far as the R-on-T phenomenon, it is a matter of some controversy now and again, because it is usually only a concern in adults who have had a heart attack, and even then many studies have found that more of those patients have serious problems who have not previously had this oddity show up. It may be unusual in a nine-year-old, and it's worth a second opinon (which your doctor is seeking) but it may not actually be of much diagnostic significance.   I certainly understand and appreciate your concern, and your questions are more than welcome. I would think that if Long Q-T is suspected the doctors would want to rule it in or out as soon as possible. In the meantime the best thing (especially in case either boy does have this disorder) is to try and maintain a relaxed and positive outlook, as hard as that may be, because stress is one of the things that can trigger an episode. Also, since the diagnosis may well rest on the outcome of the adrenaliine challenge, it may be a good idea to subtly encourage both boys to refrain from competitive sports for the time being.   It's very difficult to maintain a calm exterior when one's children are at possible risk, but in this case it could actually be therapeutic.  Please do keep us updated and bring up any other questions or issues you may think of.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Steve - I am wondering what caused your son to initially be brought in for LQT testing. Did he have any fainting episodes or other symptoms suggestive of LQT? Is there a family history of LQT or deafness? These things are very important factors in sorting out this sort of problem so that it can be treated appropriately.  The fact that your son exhibited a junctional rhythm upon standing and hyperventilating is odd for a person with LQT, but of course not unheard of. It seems more likely to suggest a blocking of some portion of the conduction pathway or an abnormal slowing (as in what is known as vagotonia, an inappropriate slowing of the heart by the vagus nerve as in dysautonomia). These conditions are generally less worrisome than Long QT, but still would need to be addressed. And of course, if there is a family history of LQT, then all this could simply be prelude to a more complete presentation of LQT symptoms (usually fainting upon being startled by a loud noise, during stress, etc.). This sounds, based on what you've reported, as though the AV junction is temporarily taking over the pacemaking duties because of an imappropriately slowed sinus rhythm. The fact that it may be cutting the rate in half sounds like there could actually be some sort of intermittent block, but I am thinking vagal stimulation is more likely because it occurred upon standing and with hyperventiilation, two things which can stimulate an overly sensitive vagus nerve.   Your son might have some variant condition that could cause symptoms similar to LQT, which would be a more benign diagnosis, although Long QT is treatable. It needs to be very accurately diagnosed, however, in order to treat it effectively. If the problem is vagotonia instead, there are different therapeutic approaches.   I am not familiar with a direct correlation between a junctional rhythm and TdP, although there can be an indirect relationship. TdP is the usual arrhythmia seen in LQT patients. A junctional escape rhythm is a backup system built in to take over for a too slow heart rate resulting from vagal stimulation or one of the higher degree heart blocks. Symptoms of either of these and LQT can be similar, but the causes really quite different.   I hope you get a concrete answer soon, so that you can relax and know that the problem will receive the appropriate treatment.   I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Yes this information is very helpful. My son showed borderline Long QT on a few ECGs he had done to investigate a heart murmur that the doctor found while checking him over because he was having dizziness and near fainting spells while swimming and playing hockey. His exercise test showed a QT interval of .478. There is a family history of collapse and sudden death in my mothers family as well, including my sister with a near drowning at the age of 13. My 19 year old son fainted while running about 9 months ago and went into cardiac arrest. It was diagnosed as asthma at the time because he has had severe asthma his whole life and had taken several puffs of ventolin before running. He has since had an ECG showing Borderline Long QT as well. We are just waiting to see his ECGs from the night he was brought into the hospital. The cardiologist we saw that night said that his QT was prolonged because of the ventolin. But I don't have much faith in that cardiologist just by the way he treated us then. The new cardiologist we are seeing is much more thorough. The kids are all scheduled for adrenaline challenge tests soon so a treatment plan can be put in place. The cardiologist also mentioned an AV block about my 9 year old but said that this can be secondary to Long QT Syndrome. Thanks again Stevie\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again - With that family history it seems rather likely your child does have evolving Long QT syndrome. The junctional escape rhythm probably has been  functoining as a backup during loss of normal ventricular stimulation. Also, families with a history  of electric derangement of the heart's conduction system can have variations and/or additional abnormalities.   The episode your 19 year old experienced may well have been  the equivalent of an adrenaline challenge as the combination of natural adrenaline (released during an  athletic activity) plus the ventolin, which is powerful medicatoin similar in effect to adrenaline. The doctor who observed that the long QT interval at the time was probably caused by the ventolin seems to have missed the greater point that anyone predisposed to Long QT is likely to have it increased by use of any epinepherine-like  drug. Long QT, as you probably know, can be intermittent and can also be acquired (usually due to use of certain medications).   Use of beta blockers is often recommended therapeutically for confirmed LQT, and can provide a fair degree of protection.  There are also implantable devices available for appropriate subjects. The important thing is that this condition can usually be managed, although sometimes some lifestyle changes have to be made as well.  It seems you are now in  good hands with the new doctor,  who appears to be doing all the necessary and appropriate things.  I wish you and yours all the  best.  Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello I am 44 year old female with a long history of PVCs. 20 years of them. I got them so bad last month that they seemed to go on around the clock. Hard to sleep and function made me real tired and weak. .I went to the Hospital twice. Had two EKGs, 2 chest xrays and was hooked to the heart monitor for a total of 7 hours plus had all blood work done twice. I went to the cardiolgist and had An echo and a 24 hour halter monitor. They showed only PVCS which Doc said was probably due to my hormone or  possibly my moderately low Hemoglobin due to thelesemia minor. Then he gave me a stress test. It was hard to reach my max of 149 went up to 146 because of the Atenorol i take for the PVCS and high blood pressure which is controlled with the meds. The tech said i had an ST abnormality slight during the beginning then more pronounced at the end i think it went on a downslop ( i think). The doctor looked at the test quickly and sent me home.I have a follow up on Jan 15th. He did not seem to  be that concerned when he looked at it quickly before i left the office. I am just wondering how all the test that i had could be normal but that one was not. . I have read that there are a lot of false positives in woman. I also had another EKG done at the Cardiology  office which showed only the PVCS?  I also read that the anemia may cause the ST ABnormaliies?  Thanks in advance for you help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello capricekid -  PVCs are one of the most common chronic complaints, and one which can cause severe anxiety in otherwise healthy patients, leading to many more ER visits and testing than would otherwise normally be done. They are rarely serious and almost never of any diagnostic significance. They are rarely treated unless they are causing the patient severe emotional distress, which is often the case. They can accompany any form of heart disease but also occur commonly in totally normal hearts. The list of potential benign causes is so long it would be impractical to go over them all here, but a few of the most common might be helpful:  - Mitral Valve Prolapse (usually benign and often an equivocal findingl) - electrolyte imbalance (most often too little potassium, although   sometimes too much as well) - anxiety - stress - sleep disturbance -caffeine - nicotine  In some cases the use of a beta blocker, the treatment of choice in most instances, can actually serve to produce more PVCs, as this type of drug slows the heart rate, and that is often the reason for the PVCs in the first place (in healthy patients activity will often make PVCs go away, while rest slows the heart rate and they come back again). Still, beta blockers are the safest and most effective medication for otherwise benign PVCs.  Now then: you mention that you were told by a tech after your recent stress test that you had some S-T abnormalities,  especially near the end of the test. This is unfortunate, and it is why many doctors encourage their staff to keep such well-intended observations to themselves. It often causes far more anxiety in the patient rather than reassuring them. S-T and T-wave abnormalities are very common in healthy people for a variety of reasons, although of course they also can be suggestive of a problem, depending on the context as interpreted by the attending physician. In this case the physician seemed unconcerned and you do have a follow up scheduled, so any dangling questions can be addressed at that time. Of course if you should have any new symptoms in the meantime you should notify your doctor or, if they are severe, get yourself to the nearest emergency department. This is generic advice for anyone, and not based on any information you have supplied in your post.   It is worth noting that while you did not reach your maximal  heart rate during the stress test, you only missed it by 3 beats. This is a very good showing for someone taking Atenolol, and should be considered an adequate rate to make the test a success.  PVCs do occur in nearly everyone, and in some they are extremely frequent while in others they are either infrequent or for some mysterious reason they are not noticed by the subject.   It sounds as though you're in good shape, but once you've had a chance to press the doctor about the tech's comment you will likely feel a lot better.  Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello chalotta1980: I think it is safe to say that PVCs and the vagus nerve are almost a hand-in-hand affair. While some PVCs are caused by direct irritation of the heart muscle or by medications, they are also very frequently the result of what is known as the \"vagus effect\", which takes place when the vagus nerve is stimulated by any one of a number of things. Since the vagus nerve is not only responsible for slowing the heart rate but also with promoting peristalsis (the churning action of the stomach and intestines to assist in digestion) it is very common for people to experience PVCs after having eaten. There is also the natural slowing of the body's metabolism at day's end, with slowing of the heart rate, and so at bedtime there are also more PVCs noted in many people. This is all very normal.   In addition, since you are diagnosed with acid reflux, there is the potential for a bolus of food and/or stomach acid to work its way up into your esophagus after having eaten, and this bolus can produce PVCs in two ways as well: one, by causing pressure on the vagus nerve, which runs down the neck alongside the esophagus, and also by being accompanied by bloating that can actually press against the heart and \"tickle\" it, again provoking PVCs. All of this is perfectly normal and benign (although acid reflux ought not be seen as \"normal\" and should be treated to prevent the symptoms as well as potential damage to the lining of the esophagus). A large proportion of people experience PVCs after having eaten, even if they don't suffer from acid reflux. Anything that stimulates the vagus nerve will put a \"braking effect\" on the heart rate, and that will usually provoke at least some PVCs.   It's annoying, but in and of itself it is fairly normal and benign. I hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "About 12 years ago (when I was 18), I started suffering from chest pains. My doctor told me it was Fibrositis, and put me on a simple course of ibuprofen. Over the years, the pain has reoccurred infrequently, with different levels of pain from very mild to moderate, and tends to change according to whether I lie down, stand up, etc.   For the last while, I have also been feeling a fluttering sensation in my chest, which is a rather scary feeling. When it happens, I feel a sensation similar to that physical sensation you feel when you receive a very bad fright - like the blood drains from your face (I'm not sure if this is actually because I DO feel frightened when it happens, or whether it's a part of the fluttering sensation). The fluttering never lasts more than 1 - 2 seconds, and I have no other symptoms - ever. The reason I mentioned the above chest pain is to determine whether the fibrositis was a misdiagnosis, and whether it may actually be connected to the fluttering as a symptom of a more grave disorder. The fluttering is infrequent, and I can go months without feeling it, but then it might happen twice in one week. I am 30 and am otherwise in perfect health. No fatigue, no dizziness, or anything else associated with coronary issues. What do you think it may be? Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello ecoli: From the sound of your symptoms you probably are having two different things go on at once, which is causing some confusion and anxiety for you. The pains you describe do sound like an inflammatory process and not like cardiac pain, which almost always will show up deep in the center of the chest and radiate to one or both shoulders, arms, and even the little finger, as well as up into the neck and lower jaw.  However, even for atypical cardiac pain, what you describe seems rather like something else, as atypical pain almost always occurs in some points along the pathway described above, ie: in the left (or both) shoulders, one or both elbows, wrists, the neck or the jaw. It may also show up in the center of the upper back. Yours seems to be popping up in rather random locations. However, the severity of any suspect chest pain should not be the measure of its importance, but rather where it occurs and what else is going on at the same time. For instance, does movement, such as twisting of your upper body, reaching, bending, etc., evoke the pain? Is the pain aggravated by exertion or does it occur at rest? The answers to these questions can help determine what sort of pain you are having. It sounds like your doctor got the pain diagnosis right off the bat.   The fluttering sensation in your chest is probably Premature Atrial or Ventricular Contractions (PACs and PVCs). These are quite normal and common with or without heart disease, and can be provoked or aggravated by caffeine, nicotine, anxiety, stress, sleep deprivation, inhalation of noxious fumes, etc. The list is quite long, and sometimes there is no apparent reason for them.   It doesn't appear that the chest pain and the fluttering sensation (palpitations) are likely to be related. However, only a medical doctor can make certain of this, so if you are made uneasy by the fluttering it would make sense to visit your doctor and bring this matter up to him. A resting EKG and perhaps a 24-hour Holter monitor study could rule out anything out of the ordinary and help you to feel more relaxed about the sensations.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Marley9697: The first question I would ask, since you have the echocardiogram results in hand, is: has your doctor suggested that you should be concerned? I realize sometimes doctors will pass along what they feel are results that are within normal limits and not really explain this, so that's why I'm asking. From what I read, your echocardiogram appears to be within normal limits as far as heart function is concerned. There is noted Mitral Valve Prolapse, but no mention of it being pronounced. There is also mention of some sclerotic changes to the aortic valve, again with no mention of any degree of severity. I would note that both findings, in and of themselves, mean very little. Only a pronounced mitral valve prolapse with moderate to severe regurgitation would be a matter of concern. As for the aortic valve, some sclerotic changes will normally show up beyond middle age, but no obstruction nor leak is noted, so that seems to be working as it should. There is \"slight\" tricuspid regurgitation, again apparently within normal limits, since there is nothing remarkable noted. Quite often one or more heart valves will demonstrate some inconsequential  regurgitation and this has to be noted, as with any imperfection, but without any serious concerns added to the report it sounds as though everything esentially is working well.   Had you had any symptoms or complaints prior to the echocardiogram that might have suggested heart disease, or was this test just done to establish a baseline for you? You would appear to be quite healthy based on the report alone.   Hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "title": "Chest Pain and Heart Palpitations",
    "content": "Hello, I am a thrity one year old female who has been having heart palpitations, or fluttering, flip flopping of the heart mostly while lying down.  After the palpitations etc.  sometimes I am short of breath and my fingers and feet tingle or feel cold, I feel dizzy and sometimes it seems as if the room starts to fade or become dark.  I also  experience mild chest pain, shoulder and neck pain with headache.  On one occasion I was also very sick to my stomach.  I have never had any serious sugeries.  My doctor seems to think I am having panic attacks or anxiety attacks.  He perscribed Lexapro for anxiety and Xanax for the flare ups.  I also have Hypothyrodism which on my last test was fine and I take Synthroid.  I also have Athsma, for which I use an inhaler as needed.  Along with the other symptoms above, alot of the time I am very tired and weak and I have one to two migraines per month for which I was perscribed Relpax, I have only taken this medication once.  My family has a history of heart disease.  My Uncle had a tripple bypass at 39 and another bypass in his 50's.  My grandmother died of congestive heart failure and her mother died of an heart attack.  My aunt also has heart problems and I have a great aunt who had a brain tumor and died.  My doctor doesn't seem to look into familhy history or ask about it.  He just seems to be convinced that it's anxiety.  I would really appriciate your opinion on this.   Thank you so much for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Searching: While your symptoms are syfficiently vague to lead to a presumptive conclusion of anxiety as the root cause, there are two other factors that could be causing your symptoms. One is innocent and normal. The other warrants a closer look.   The \"innocent\" factor is bedtime palpitations, which are caused by the same mechanism as \"after dinner\" palpitations: a slowing of the heart due to natural fatigue and/or stimulation of the vagus nerve by digestion. This is quite normal.   The one that warrants a closer look is your positive family history for coronary artery disease. While premature beats, the usual cause of palpitations, are not diagnostic of heart disease at all, the fact that they brought you in to the doctor's office and caused you to disclose a positive family history, normally would be enough to warrant a cardiac consult to rule out any possible coronary artery disease. The simplest way to do this would be for your doctor to refer you for a nuclear scan stress test and echocardiogram. If these are all normal (as is likely) then you could feel safe in trying to ignore the palpitations or learn to live with them.   As your doctor has duly noted, there is a basis for suspecting many of your symptoms are caused by anxiety, and that has been treated. If your symptoms continue to make you uncomfortable then the real issue should be addressed by ruling out any possibility of coronary artery disease. My instincts suggest this to be a combination of normal ectopic heartbeats and some attendant anxiety, but I also feel it would be helpful to you to have active heart disease ruled out, something I would suggest to anyone with a strong postive family history. Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 21 year old female experiencing skipped hearbeats and shortness of breath, mostly when I am lying down on my back and left side. I get relief by sitting up or switching sleep positions. Lately these skipped heart beats have become more regular and not always when I am lying down. I have also been experiencing sharp pains in the right side of my head, but I am unsure if that is related. My mother has mitral valve prolapse and a history of mini strokes. I have been to several doctors and I was given blood tests. My cholesterol is normal level and so is my blood pressure. My pulse tends to run a little high though (around 90 sitting) so I was put on atenolol but since I have moved I have no refills therefore no meds. I have had an ekg but everything appeared normal. I am a non smoker with little caffeine intake. Is this cause for concern? What could it possibly be?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear jfrank8028, it sounds as if you have approached the medical community with your symptoms and had appropriate initial symptomatic workup but have yet to follow-up with a cardiologist and perhaps submit to a holter-monitor. This would allow the practitioner to gather information over a period of prescribed and continuous time; this could lead to recorded disclosure of your arrhythmia along with associated symptoms. It is a method that records your cardiac activity concurrent with your keeping an event-diary. You said you had run out of your prescription medication; this suggests that cost may be a factor; you didn't mention if the symptoms resolved during the use of atenolol...might be helpful to know the answer to that. You said your heart rate was unusually fast at 90 bpm while sitting...could be a response to the environment you were in at the time, or, could be something more. You were placed on the beta-blocker atenolol which will slow an unusually rapid heart rate, alleviate chest pressure/pain and, in turn, reduce related anxiety. When first reading your post, what immediately came to mind were palpitations related to frequent premature ventricular contractions, premature atrial contractions, a combination of both or a tachyarrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation or a supra-ventricular tachycardia...all of which may occur at any time but be most apparant while at rest when you are more sensitive to the dysrhythmia. I do think that since the activity has never manifested when you presented for medical evaluation that it would probably be beneficial to you and your practitioner to pursue the round-the-clock method to monitor cardiac activity. I would not delay follow up as this could be a precurser to a more serious pathology. Perhaps one of the cardiology experts will chime in here with more info. for you. Best of luck and good health be yours.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear jfrank8028: You have already gotten a very good reply from Aeron12. I would only add a few observations, as what you describe is actually a rather common complaint. There is a suspicion that most of the time when we lie down we are ready to go to sleep, and so are feeling tired. The body is wanting to slow down, and lying down changes the demands on the heart rather abruptly. Lying on one's left side or back places the heart into closer proximity with skeletal structures which, in some individuals, can result in some actual physical contact between the heart and chest wall. Since most hearts are easily \"annoyed\" by touching, and since the heart is having the \"brakes put on\" by sleepiness and the change in posture already (due to stimulation of the vagus nerve which slows heart rate as well as causing peristalsis - stomach and intestinal churning), it's not surprising that this would be a common occurrence and so a common complaint. Not everyone is equally aware of their heart's behavior, and not everyone is affected this way, but an awfully large number of people are. So although it is likely unnerving and annoying it really isn't unusual nor is it likely a cause for concern.   As Aeron12 points out, what you are likely feeling are Premature Ventricular Contractions (the most common heart irregularity and one which normally occurs with slowing of the rate). They can occur at random intervals but a lot of people also experience what's known as \"group beating\" - a regular beat followed by a premature one - which is known as bigemeny. (If there are two regular beats then an early one, repeatedly, then it is called trigemeny, and so on). There's nothing inherently wrong with this, but if one can feel it then it draws attention to itself and can cause unease.  PVCs can occur at rest (most often) or during exercise. When they occur at rest they frequently will disappear upon exertion, and vice versa, because they are primarily a function of the heart's slowing. They are not diagnostic of anything, and are rarely of any clinical significance, but that doesn't mean they can't make you feel awfully uncomfortable. Reassurance, and sometimes a beta blocker, can reduce the frequency, although there are instances where the beta blocker's slowing of the heart rate can actually encourage them.   You said you were origninally placed on a beta blocker because your resting heart rate was 90, which is actually considered the upper limit of normal, especially if you are petite. (The smaller a person is, the more likely the resting rate will tend toward the faster end of the scale).   You also mention that your mother has Mitral Valve Prolapse, and this often is a familial trait. People with MVP often have more frequent and varied heartbeat irregularities, usually of no real consequence except the emotional harm that can be incurred by worrying that something is wrong with the heart. Whether or not your doctor decides to prescribe a Holter monitor to discover the true frequency of your premature beats (not a bad way to get a little peace of mind), you might want to have MVP ruled out by means of an echocardiogram, since there is a family history. MVP is usually considered quite benign also, but knowing what's going on generally helps people cope better with the annoying symptoms it can cause.   By the way, sudden withdrawal of beta blocker (Atenolol in this case) could provoke additional premature beats and other annoying symptoms. One should always be weaned off beta blockers rather than stopping them abruptly. This may explain why you're noticing more premature beats now.   In short, while there is a possible familial trait, it is not usually a serious one, but can cause enough vague and random symptoms that it would be worth knowing about. Other than that you sound like a very healthy young woman.\n\n",

    "title": "Problems after EP Study and Ablation",
    "content": "I'am a 28 year old male.  My cholesterol is low and BP is good.  Since July I've been having bad episodes of a fast heart rate.  I wore an event monitor but it proved inconclusive because the data captured over the phone kept yielding too much noise - they think the machine was faulty, since I tried over several phones.  I would get a fast heart rate of 120-150, once or twice a day.  This would usually occur after eating, not always, but I often felt worse after eating.  I would sometimes feel like hot liquid was being injected into me at the same time, sort of like a CT-Scan Dye.  Not wanting to wait another month, they had me undergo an EP Study.  During the EP Study,  They induced a typical atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and ablated it.  Then there was cardioversion for afib induced by the pacing with isoproterenol.    I thought this was over.  But I still have a fast heart rate and feel worse.  I have an all over shaking feeling now and often feel exhausted.  They say the fast heart rate is typical sinus node, or as far as they've been able to tell at the dr's office.  I take Lopressor 25mg twice a day.  I meet with my cardiologist on Monday and am unsure what to ask, as last time I mentioned this he really seemed to brush this off as my rhtyhm is now normal because he's been there.  But my GP told me that it is normal for a person to maybe need multiple ablations...if that's the case, then how come he's so certain it's right the first time?  Is it possible that the ablation made things worse?  I'm feeling in worse shape now than I did before they did this.  If my condition is just getting worse, what questions or tests should I request?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Your complaint is not an unusual one. There are probably several possible explanations for what's going on, but first I would encourage you to be persistent with your doctor until you feel you've been heard and have some peace of mind, since when our hearts misbehave we feel them quite acutely and the healthcare provider does not, even if he or she may have experienced something similar. Many cases are similar but the experience is always unique.  That being said, first of all it is very common, following an AVNRT ablation, for the patient to have some intermittent episodes of junctional tachycardia afterward. This does not feel quite the same as the original problem, but it can be uncomfortable. It is because the A/V node has been \"worked on\" and sometimes remains irritable for a while. This usually passes in a short time. If it doesn't, although it is not dangerous, it needs at the very least a good talking-through. Also, it is not unheard of for one who has had such an ablation to have to return for a \"fine tuning\" of the work, as some miniscule fibers sometimes can remain in place to allow the \"short circuit\" to occasionally fire.   The likely reason your cardiologist seems so certain that your current rapid heart rate is \"normal\" (sinus tach) is likely because that is what he sees on your resting EKG or Holter monitor tracings. There is a significant difference in the waveforms of \"normal\" accellerated heart rate, and you describe certain symptoms from both before and after the ablation that suggest, not unreasonably, that you may have some underlying anxiety that is causing your heart to speed up now. Feeling uncertain about what is going on with one's heart is a very common cause of acute anxiety, and even a totally normal heart will react to the release of adrenaline caused by anxiety, by speeding up. The fact that you experience shaking and fatigue also strongly suggest anxiety. No one wants to hear that explanation, and it should never be given carelessly. Your doctor needs to reassure you in a way that you can take home with you feeling good about his responses. This can be very difficult, especially when anxiety complicates the picture, but it is part of a doctor's responsibility, to treat the whole patient and make sure he is fine emotionally as well as physically.   Hopefully these thoughts of mine will help you to communicate your concerns to your doctor and also to reassure you that you're sounding pretty normal given what you've experienced so far. Good luck to you!\n\n",

Both sides of my family have a history of high BP,but no one has ever had anything beyond that well in to thier 90's.  My BP currently averages 114/86 and pulse is 84 at rest.

An unusually slow heart rate is called bradycardia, and an occasional extra heart beat is called extrasystole.   Common causes include: - Exercise  - Anxiety, stress, fear  - Caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, diet pills  - Overactive thyroid  - Anemia  and decrease O2 supply to tissues.ow levels of oxygen in your blood  -Fever  -Mitral valve prolapse and other heart disease   -Medications such as beta blockers for high blood pressure or heart disease, or anti-arrhythmics.  Some drugs used to treat GERD cause irregular heart beats, however a direct connection between GERD and changes in heart beats is not known at least to my knowledge.   Diagnosis is made by physical examination and certain tests like:  EKG  Ambulatory cardiac monitoring ( Holter monitor) for 24 hours Echocardiogram   I advise you to follow up with your doctor meanwhile try top avoid factors that increase these symptoms like: - smoking.  -Unbalanced diet, excess coffe Exercise regularly.  And make sure that your blood pressure and cholesterol are under control.   Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 24 year old female.  I have been experience palpitations since I was a teenager.  They would feel like a flutter and usually would be one beat several times a day for about a month, then they would stop for several months.  I noticed that excessively drinking caffinated pops would often trigger them.  Because I had previously been diagnosed as having a Mitral Valve Prolapse by several doctors after having scarlet fever at age 10, I attributed them along with my exercise intolerance to that and the caffeine.   A few years ago I had another episode of palpitations except at one point instead of having one flutter, I had several in a row and felt dizzy and short of breath.  It lasted several seconds then stopped.   Recently I have been experiencing a rapid heartbeat, which my doctors determined was a normal sinus rhythm, dizziness, and a pounding heartbeat as well as the occasional palpitation. They believe it to be POTS.  I have stopped all caffeine several months ago.  I have also had several EKG's, 2 chest x-rays, several thyroid tests, a holter monitor, and an echo.  Everything except the holter came back normal (showed palpitations) the doctor didn't even find the MVP anymore. I have heard that several palpitations in a row, 5 or more, is indicitive of ventricular tachycardia.  However, I have also heard that ventricular tachycardia is a fast regular rhythm and ventricular fibrillation is the fluttering rhythm.   My question is: is several palpitations in a row serious as in ventricular tachycardia or is it usually something more benign and how worried should I be considering my previous episode? AlsoIf my heart is structurally normal and I have stopped all caffeine what can I do, short of medication, to stop these palpitations from occuring?  I'm sorry this is so long, just wanted to make sure you had as much information as I could remember.  Thank you for taking the time to read and answer my questions.\n\n",

    "content": "The beats that you describe as a flutter are likely premature ventricular contractions (PVC's).  These occur when the bottom pumping chambers decide to beat on their own rather than in conjuction with the top chambers.  If we were to put a holter monitor on everyone, we'd find that most people have some PVC's.  These are harmless beats.  Often, things like caffeine will \"excite\" the heart and cause a few more PVC's to occur, much like you describe.  As the heart rate increases, normally the speed of the heart overrides these PVC's and they decrease in frequency.  PVC's that increase with an increasing heart rate may not be normal and should be evaluated.  Ventricular tachycardia is when the ventricals decide to beat on their own for several beats in a row (technically >3 beats).  Essentially it is a series of PVC's one right after another.  Ventricular tachycardia if short may not be noticable, or if prolonged can ultimately lead to fainting and death if not corrected.  The range is quite varied.  If you feel as if you are having runs of these beats I would strongly recommend you be evaluated by a cardiologist.  There are other heart rhythm's that can cause palpitations that should be checked for as well.  One notable syndrome is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome which can cause a different form of tachycardia.  EKG's should pick these up.  I'm not a cardiologist, so that's about as complex as I can get for you.  As far as other things you can do, cutting down on caffeine will help.  I'd recommend you be evaluated by a cardiologist to get more information about what is going on with your heart.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Although when laying down, I do not feel the extra beats. I feel them when standing or sitting. Although he does not feel it is anything to worry about. I am very worried. They are very bothersome and he set up an appointment again with my cardiologist to get checked again and told me to take 50mg of Atenolol. I don't feel them all the time. Some days I feel nothing, then all of a sudden, there they are and I get very stressed over them. What is your opinion? Thank you  Jeff\n\n",

Some of them are as simple as being related to diet: a high intake of caffeine (from coffee, carbonated beverages, or OTC medications); an imbalanced diet, one that is deficient in potassium and or magnesium, which is very easy to check by blood levels; as well as other causes. One important question I have is do you or any of your blood relatives have a history of cardiac arrhythmias? If so, you should probably have a Holter monitor study for at least for 24 hours or some other form of more intense study. I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "title": "Fast pulse Skipped beats Low Oxygen Sat",
    "content": "My pulse frequently runs 100-140 bpm pounding at times. My heartbeats also skip as I can actually feel it stop completely. And I do not exercise, not very active either. I have anxiety issues in certain situations and now I get shaky all over from even getting just a little anxious, believe this has worsened due to my heartrate problems. My anxiety is not the cause of the fast pulse even though it can worsen it. I had an EKG 1 1/2 yrs ago & was told I have PVC but not heart related. I however don't understand why I was told I have extra heartbeats when my pulse is actually stopping. How is that possible? A friend of mine mentioned that low oxygen saturations (low as 84%) from sleep disordered breathing could cause such a condition and that my CPAP may not be working properly. Is there any truth in that? I've had repeated blood tests showing slightly elevated hemoglobin, hematocrit and carbon dioxide levels (less frequently) which I figure could mean low oxygen in my blood. I've started taking Inderal as needed, it helps the anxiety to an extent but not the heart rate. Is there anything I could ask my doc to do to find out what's causing these problems?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi angelforever34, When a person experiences PVC's (premature ventricular contractions) the symptom is often described as a missed/skipped beat, or the sensation of a flip-flop of the heart. Several things may contribute to exacerbation of PVC's, for example, caffiene intake, electrolyte distubances, Mitral valve abnormalities etc. If you have not had a cardiac workup in 1 1/2 years along with labwork etc. I would suggest that you inquire about having this completed. Low oxygen levels may produce tremors/shakiness, shortness of breath, increased heart rate, confusion, etc. I would also suggest that you inquire about a pulse oximeter (to monitor oxygen levels for at least one night) as well as an arterial blood gas (ABG) to evaluate the effectiveness of the current settings of your cpap and identification of decreased oxygen levels in the blood. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "It has been awhile since my last post. My question is. Why do I not notice anyone suggesting that the palpatations that people are experiencing could possibably be due to pre-menopausal or just hormonal changes in their bodies? Alls I see is people suggesting that they change there life styles. Witch most have but no change for them. Why has there not been any research done to possibably link it to hormonal change? This is not to diagnose anyone. Just a question that I am sure that many of us have. The reasoning behind this is 11 months ago I had a baby. My first three months I had heart palpatations really bad to a point where it would take my breath away. Then I had them on and off after I had my baby. Now I notice them 2 weeks before my periods upto a week after my periods. Yes aniexty could also be a link but, the palpatations for me causes stress, aniexty, worries and so on.

The beat is really hard and slow, and then very fast upon inhalation, and exhalation it gets extremely slow again. I actually fear having an orgasm because I'm afraid my heart will go out on me.   Is this normal? I also get random patterns sometimes when just relaxing and also the flutters or thumps. The thumps make me kind of dizzy but not anywhere near passing out. Also, at times the beat can be felt very clearly on the right side of my neck which is quite uncomfortable. Sometimes inhaling makes me have to cough, but feels heart related. I have had ekgs although rarely during the times i feel the irregularites. I have also had a few blood tests, 2 heart xrays and 1 ct chest angio. I've been told I have anxiety by a couple doctors, but I also know anxiety can be caused by underlying health conditions. What tests should I request so that I can be tested for an arrhythmia or other heart condtions?\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 32 yo male and for almost a year have been experiencing almost identical fellings. I feel the \"skip\" coming on for 1-3 seconds prior to it happening. Not so much pain but almost a tingling or electrical sensation which builds up, then I will experience the \u201cskip\u201d feeling and an increase in pressure up the chest and neck. If this occurs while exercising I get a sudden sharp pain almost precisely btw my sternum and base of neck. Not sure if it will make you feel better but if what you are possibly feeling is PVCs or PACs, or so my Doc tells me. If in the case of PVCs the lower chambers have a premature contraction so on the next beat they are \u201copen\u201d for longer. More blood flows in and then when the beat does occur there is more blood in there to be pushed out therefore giving the feeling up the neck\u2026.. in layman\u2019s terms. At it worst I can have 12-15 of these per minute for 2-3 hours then infrequently. I never go a day or an hour without one, but unfortunately I have never been able to capture more than 60 a day on a Holter (whereas if I had a bad \u201cattack\u201d I would have 500 to 1000 within a few hours). Have you ever noticed that if you breathe deeply during a bad \u201cattack\u2019 you can almost induce them on a deep breath? The medicine Pirmenol has reduced these significantly whereas Rhythmodan had no effect.  My Doc suggests there are not life threatening\u2026 I prefer to refer to them as sanity threatening.\n\n",

    "title": "PVCs",
    "content": "Hi:  These are almost certainly PVCs (premature ventricular contractions), also called VEBs (ventricular ectopic beats).  They are caused by excitabilty in the heart tissue of the ventricles.  Normally, a beat is initiated by the sinus node (at the top of the atria), it passes through the atria causing them to contract, then passes through the AV (atrio-ventricular) node to the ventricles, causing them to contract.  In the case of a PVC, a ventricular cell initiates a beat.  This beat is usually not perceived (skipped beat), but the next beat (which is stronger due to extra ventricular filling) is perceived as a palpitation.   The sensation in the neck is due to the increased blood volume pumped from the heart, and from momentary disruption of the normal wave form of blood flow from the heart.   PVCs are actually a fairly normal occurrence...One study showed that up to 50-60% of healthy people experience occasional PVCs (although they may not feel them). Caffeine, nicotine, stress and cold medicines are common precipitants of PVCs.  I used to experience them pretty frequently in medical school, when I was drinking a lot of coffee...I had almost the exact sensation that both of you have experienced...And, if you don't know what it is, it's definitely sanity threatening, even if it isn't life threatening :)   Normally PVCs can just be treated by avoiding excess caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and stress (if possible).  If they are still occuring, a beta-blocker (like propranolol, atenolol or metoprolol) will usually prevent them.  This is the recommended treatment, but certain antiarrhythmic drugs (like Pirmenol) can also be used.  Marleymum, you should have your murmur investigated...Valvular problems can potentiate PVCs.   The best treatment is still a beta-blocker (in your case it will kill two birds with one stone: PVCs and hypertension), but you still need an echo (heart ultrasound) to evaluate your heart valves.  The doctor can then try to adjust your propranolol dosage, or try metoprolol or an antiarrhythmic to eliminate the PVCs.  In the meantime, try to cut back on coffee, tea, pop, alcohol, etc., to see if that reduces the frequency of the PVCs.  Thanks for your question!  -Reid Perala, MD (student doctor\n\n",

I know tea had some caffeine in it (in most varieties) but eventually I have cut out almost everything I can think of that contains caffeine, including soft drink but excluding some chocolate. Previously my PVCs were daily and I had literally hundreds of them. But since I have cut out caffeine, I weaned my way off Pirmenol and I have seen dramatic changes. They are not all together gone and I get some pain at time as it feels like I have one to two MASSIVE PVCs occasionally. I now only drink water, juices and of course beer but I would not be surprised if I excluded the later I would see even further progress! I have also noticed my PVCs get worse when I eat food with additives. Agree that includes almost everything these days but I completely avoid fast foods, processed foods etc. Try it, it may work for you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 38 y/o female, 118lbs, don't smoke, don't drink, no caffine not even any soda's or diet soda's. I usually walk 3 miles every day.Barely any fat intake. I had an EKG done almost a year ago. Due to my pregnancy. According to the doctors it was good. The only thing against me is my family history. Anything that could possibily go wrong with the heart my family has, or has died from it. I went to the doctor the other day because I was having what felt like \"skipping beats\"  in my heart. My apperance didn't seem to concern the doctor for immedately possible heart disease. So he asked me if I drank anything with caffine. I told him the only things that I drink was water, juices, and herbal teas. With that in mind he walked out and came back, in what felt like 30 minutes. With another docotrs opinion he told me to stop drinking the herbal teas.And see if this stops the sensation of my heart skipping beats.  I asked him why. He stated that some teas contain an herb called MA-HUANG it has the same effects as \"Ephedra\" it can cause the heart to beat abnormally, even feel like it \"skip beats\". I got on the internet and did alittle research my self about the herbal teas. Most of them also contain an herb called \"orange peel\" or A.K.A \"bitter orange\" although they state that there has not been any side effects reported. It to can cause the heart to beat irregularly. People who are sensitive to caffine, could also be sensitive to the herbal teas that contain these natural caffines. I have until monday to see if it works. If not, they want to do a stress test on my heart. and possibly put me on a beta blocker. So, far the sensation has slowed down but not totally quit yet. Of course it has only been a day since my last oral intake of the teas. I hope what is going on with me, helps others out as well.  God bless and good health   This is not to diagnose anyone this is what is going on with me, personally.\n\n",

I AM CURRENTLY ON 200MG OF ATENOLOL (IT IS BROKEN UP THROUGHOUT THE DAY). THIS SEEMS TO CONTROL THE RATE A LITTLE BIT BETTER.  VERSES 50MG OF ATENOLOL WHEN THIS PROBLEM STARTED, THEN VERAPAMIL BEING  ADDED TO THE EQUATION. AFTER CONSTANT DOSEAGE ADJUSTMENTS,  IT STILL OFFERED NO RELIEF. I HAVE BEEN TO AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIST, HIS CONCLUSION WAS THAT IT IS MOST LIKELY A IST(INAPPROPRIATE SINUS TACHYCARDIA) , AND IT IS AUTOMATICITY IN NATURE, NOT RE-ENTRANT. I HAVE HAD A TILT TABLE TEST- THE RESULTS WERE NAGATIVE. MY ECHO. WAS NORMAL. MY THYROID HAS ALSO BEEN DECLARED NORMAL. I ALSO WENT ON THE TREADMILL- NOTE: THIS WAS NOT A STANDARD STRESS TEST.- WITH IN 4 MINUTES OF BEING ON THE TREADMILL, MY HEART RATE WAS 206 BPM, AND 28 UNIFOCAL PVC'S. I WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS NORMAL. EVEN THOUGH, I NEVER HAVE HAD THAT KIND OF INTOLERANCE TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, I AM A NON SMOKER, AND I HAVE CUT ALL CAFFIENE INTAKE.  AT THIS POINT I AM CONSTANTLY SHORT OF BREATH, AND VERY TIRED. I KNOW THAT MY 12 LEAD ECG APPEARS TO BE NORMAL. AS TIME HAS WENT ON- THERE'S ALL KINDS OF LITTLE PALPITATIONS THAT HAVE JUMPED IN. PAC'S WITH ABBERANT CONDUCTION, AT TIMES I'LL HAVE SHORT RUNS OF PVC'S THAT JUST TAKE MY BREATH AWAY AND MAKE ME FEEL AS IF I'M GOING TO PASS OUT. I AM FORTUNATELY ABLE TO CAPTURE THESE EVENTS ON A CARDIAC MONITOR AT WORK. THESE DOCTOR'S SAY IT IS NORMAL?? I JUST HAVE A SENSITIVE SA NODE. I DON'T FEEL THAT IT IS NORMAL. IT HAS IMPAIRED MY ABILITY TO BE ACTIVE AND EXCERCISE. I CAN'T TOLERATE THE HEART RATE WHILE EXCERCISING. FORTUNATELY I'M NOT AT A POINT WHERE I AM OVERWEIGHT. BUT I HAVE GAINED 15 POUNDS IN THIS LAST 9 MONTHS. I WORRY THAT WITH MY HEART WORKING SO HARD ALL OF THE TIME- THAT I AM HEADED IN A BAD DIRECTION- AS IN DEVELOPING CARDIOMYOPATHY AT A FAIRLY YOUNG AGE. ANY GUIDANCE WOULD BE APPRECIATED AT THIS POINT.\n\n",

If you have PVCs, in runs, and that makes you dizzy or faint then they MUST be trrated and with Amiodarone 200 mg 3 times daily for ten days, thereafter 200 mg once daily indefinitely.  Amiodarone will control your s tachycardia also. Plus, all this has jacked up your anxiety level so you need to take antianxiety pill like Sertraline.  Atenolol will not be needed if amiodarone controls the tachycardia too UNLESS you have high BP also.  Dr Apurva Madia\n\n",

    "title": "Pimenol and Arrhythmia",
    "content": "For almost a year now my doctors have been searching for the cause of my constants dizziness and palpitations. A holter monitor diagnosed me with Wenckebach (only occurred during sleeping) and mild occurrences of PVCs / PACs. None of which I could say I ever really felt before. From about 4 months ago I started experiencing skipped beats (PVC/ PAC) usually in the AM, soon after waking and they would continue for up to three hours sometimes with as many as 5-9 skipped beats per minute. I could physically feel these happening and confirm it my simply feeling my pulse. Doctors tried tranquilizers and Seloken beta blocker assuming stress. No change, even after three weeks vacation!! Doctors then tried me on Pimenol 50mg. This has had immediate effects. It has decreased PVC/ PAC activity by around 90% and palpitations by about 50%. I still get the occasional \u201cJolt\u201d in the chest of a skipped beat and some pain but nothing regular.   My question to the doctor which was not able to be answered was, what does this tell us the cause is? He suggested an imbalance in the Central Nervous System (Sympathetic), but could not say if the problem was centred in the heart, or in the CNS. Can anyone tell me how Pimenol works exactly and after numerous ECGS, echocardiograms, treadmill test, and radio-isotope test that tells me I have a heart with no physiological problems or disease (aside from LVH 13mm). What the success of this medicine means? I do not want to take medicine long term just because it works, I need to know how it works. Should I request an EPS? FYI I also have 2 herniated disks in C2-3 and C 3-5, near but not touching the vagus nerve. I have slightly swollen glands/ muscles where my submaxillary glands otherwise are. When off medication I found a reasonable correlation between eating foods with additives and preservatives and the occurrence of the arrhythmia.\n\n",

    "content": "I do not seem to have much luck with anyone posting replies but since my above post I have been on 30 days on Pimenol which was very effective to begin with but the effects seemed to slowly wear off with the occurrence of at least 60 PVCs and PACs in a 24hour period seen on a holter (almost all of which I very much felt and pressed the \u201cevent\u2019 button for.  My doctor has now put me on Rhythmodan as he suggests it has less side effects than the former. Interestingly enough however I stopped the Pimenol and started the Ryhtmodan last weekend. It was 2 days since my last Pimenol and 36 hours after my first Rythmodan and my skipped beats began again. Between 351am and 430am I was experiencing 12-15 \u201cskipped\u201d beats per minute which did not appear to subside as they were still there when I woke at 630am. Against what I should do I took my normal dose of Pimenol and I was OK again within a few hours.   Understanding drugs are different but aside from the trade name I think Pimenol and Rhythmodan are very similar. Anyone have any ideas why these may have significant different results for me, and possibly give me some insight into the real cause.   Would anyone suggest the high frequency of PVCs/ PACS physically felt when I am not on medication to be dangerous? Echo, radio isotope tests etc suggests my heart is structurally OK. Is this like having a house which is structurally strong but which the lights don\u2019t work in every room?\n\n",

Last night I was sitting in my car, calm and in a good mood when my heart rate became very erratic. At one point there were no beats at all for about 3 seconds.  After about 10-15 seconds it returned to a normal pace (other than the affect my anxiety was having on it). This happens to me about once per month and while there's no pain involved, it's a very unpleasant feeling.  My question is: what causes this and is it dangerous?  I've had previous testing done based on prior, similar events (ekg, stress test, holter) with normal results. But nobody's ever told me what this is or why it happens.  Very scary when it happens and affects life for several days after.   A little more background:  I had no alcohol for 72 hours prior, and had last ingested caffeine about 5 hours prior.  No drugs in system except for 1000mg of acetomenaphine taken between 3 and 6 hours prior for a headache.  Thank you in advance for your advice.\n\n",

Once this is ruled out, your Doc can determine if you should take meds or not. I am currently taking 25 mg of Atenolol, which is not helping at all. In fact, they have almost gotten worse. I am having them now as we speak. You should really stay away from caffeine and alcohol, even though alcohol seems to be the only time when I don't have them; oddly enough.

    "content": "Hi, I am a 22 year old male and have been experiencing various symptoms for around 6 months now. At first I was lying in bed and was suddenly vary aware of my heat beat, It is hard to describe but I had a kind of sudden rush of adrenaline, a very strange feeling which was followed by palpitations. Since then this has happened quite often, although admittedly it happened more after a night out, or a night in the pub. More recently I have not experienced this feeling but I have been continuing to get palpitations and in the last few months I have had a very dull aching sensation in the left side of my chest which I am aware of every day, it is usually just under my breast bone on the left side of my chest however can sometimes be just under my arm and shoulder. Being a student I am not overly healthy however I am of very slim tall build and in recent months I have been exercising regularly which does not seem to have any affect in causing the pain. I don\u2019t drink coffee, and smoke very infrequently and have been eating healthily recently. Through visiting my doctor about this he heard the palpitations and sent me for an ECG of which the results were normal and he said it is nothing to worry about. With symptoms continuing I returned only for him to further express that I have nothing to worry about, although I still have no answers for my chest discomfort. It is mostly when I am relaxing, but also throughout the day, and the palpitations along with what feels like an extra beet on occasions sometimes keeps me awake at night. I was wondering if it could be anxiety related as there have been a lot of changes in my life recently, if so how could I overcome this? Or is there anything else this could be related to? i am on no medication and the only history i am aware of is that my grandfatherer had a heart bypass opperation, although due to my age i would not have thought this was relevent? Thanks for your help. Matt\n\n",

A device called an ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) can be placed, and will sense if an episode is happening.

    "content": "Dear pistol81,  Palpitations can be caused by: 1. An overactive thyroid gland. 2. Electrolytes disturbance. 3. Mitral valve prolapse. 4. Smoking. 5. Drinking alcohol. 6. Drinking too much caffeinated beverages. 7. Not getting enough sleep. 8. Stress.  If not already done i would suggest a blood test for thyroid gland and electrolytes.  An echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) is usually to rule out the presence of mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse is a fairly common condition found in otherwise healthy young adults who usually complain of palpitations and atypical chest pain. By now i think that you already had your echocardiogram but not sure whether or not you know the results already and whether or not you discussed the results with your cardiologist.  Another test is to have a holter monitor (portable heart monitor) that the patient wears for 24 hours, it will show how extra beats you have and their nature all over the 24 hours which is better than just having an ekg.  Stop smoking if you are, stop drinking alcohol and caffeinated beverages, try to have enough sleep and rest. Stress can cause this kind of symptoms as well.

    "content": "I've had a echo and a holter monitor test within the last 2 weeks.  I do have extra beats somewhat frequently, but my cardiologist said that it is \"not serious\".  He said that there is no structural damage with the heart, and there is an extremely small prolapse when I have the extra beats, and he doesnt classify me as having MVP.  Besides that everything is normal.  He doesnt want me on medication, but said that if the symptoms still bother you, then he can give me something.    I was a pretty heavy drinker on the weekends, until my regular occurence of these beats started a month ago.  I still go out on the weekends, but try to have no more than 2-3 drinks over a typical 4 hour period.  My question is if alcohol in a minimal consumption could make this problem worse.  I still feel the extra beats; mostly because I am obsessed with thinking about it, and I really only feel relaxed and \"normal\" during workouts and when my mind has something else to worry about.  Thanks for listening.\n\n",

    "title": "Irregular Heartbeat",
    "content": "Hi,  I am a 24 year old male student.Lately I have been experiencing irregular heartbeats.It first started about a week ago and has been constant since then.I have been checking my pulse daily and counting the number of beats in a minute and each time I count 74 beats per minute which seems normal.For some strange reason I cannot feel the skipped beat or premature beat when I check my pulse on my wrist or neck but I do feel it skipping around my chest area.I know that sounds strange and I thought perhaps I was imagining it,but when the skip happens I get this awful pain through my body,starting around the chest area and passing down through my legs.Its an overwhelming sensation and not very pleasant.This only seems to happen at night time when I am trying to sleep and thus prevents me from sleeping,so I have to take sleeping pills for the moment.  One thing that did occur to me was maybe its a thyroid problem because I am very thin for my age and I have be been experiencing pains in my neck from time to time,but my neck does not seem swollen at all.The first time this irregular heartbeat problem started I experienced dizziness,a beating in my ears,tightness around the chest area,and also a pain in my left shoulder,around the arm pit.I think that might be connected somehow but I don't know.I have contacted my GP via telephone and arranged an appointment for next monday.  I have never experienced anything like the premature heartbeat before,I am an active person,I play sports and I walk a lot.I am asmatic but I have have not had an attack in 5 years.My mother had a thyroid problem several years ago which was corrected but I don't think its hereditarybut then it could be.I'm concerned that this may lead to more serious problems,such as heart failure but I may be over reacting.I have stopped drinking coffee,tea and minerals for the moment,and I have cut down on smoking aswell.Before this started I was drinking a lot of coffee and tea with lots of sugar per cup so that could also be the culprit.  Could this be a long term problem?or could it lead to more serious complications?any input would be very much appreciated.\n\n",

I explained to them all the symptons I've been experiencing over the last two weeks and they were at a loss,if its not showing up on a heart monitor then it must not be serious,but I keep experiencing the sensations throught my body and the heartbeat does pause on occasions.I think it might be anxiety but I don't know.  anyway just thought I'd let you know.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Brian,  It is not rare for young healthy individuals to get extra beats from time to time.  Since you already had all the bood tests, i would recommend having two more test. A holter monitor (portable heart monitor) that the patient wears as an outpatient and active for a period of 24 hours which could be extended and the patient can push a button when any symptom is felt and the patient keeps a diary for the day. The second is an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to exclude a condition called mitral valve prolpase known to cause atypical chest pain and palpitations and needs only to be followed-up.  There is no need to worry whatsoever about these extra beats, in the past, all young healthy patients with extrabeats of certain type called pvcs (which were thought to be the most dangerous) were treated, but after a major study conducted on young healthy individuals with no heart disease, it was found that there is absolutely no danger and that these extrabeats need not to be treated.  Continue the measures that you are doing. In addition, stop smoking completely, no alcohol whatsoever and get enough rest and sleep. Try not worry about those beats and try to get used to these beats if they continue.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "Dear Yasser Mokhtar,(M.D)  Thank you for the reply to my previous messages.I have indeed had a holter monitor test carried out over a 24 hour period(just 4 days ago)and that to showed nothing adnormal in my hearts rhythm.I received the results last friday and the physician reviewing the results told me everything is ok.During the 24 period I experienced no problems,no sensations,except one slight overwhelming sensation when I was trying to sleep at night which I recorded on the monitor.  My local GP prescribed 2mg of Anxicalm(Diazepam)a few days before the holter test was carried out and I felt absolutely fine for about 4 days.I am beginning to agree with my GP that they are indeed panic or anxiety attacks,because I am under a lot of strain in college and I do worry quite a lot about exams,so perhaps that is the cause of my problem.I am currently taking Inderal and anxicalm,but besides that my doctor has taken two more blood tests,to test and see if I am anemic or if its an over active thyroid gland Hyperthyroidism because  am very thin for my age(about 10 stone)so my doctor thinks it may be Hyperthyroidism, I'll have to wait and see what the results say.  The hospital physican and my local GP mentioned nothing about an echocardiogram test so perhaps they feel its not needed.Never the less I feel better,I have stopped smoking as well,stopped 2 weeks ago and I feel much better,no coughing,weezing,and my breathing in general seems a lot better.  Thanks again for reminding me that this is not a serious problem,my GP explained that to me as well,that its not uncommon for young people to experience irregular heartbeats,but at the time I over reacted and thought it was a serious problem,so apologies if my previous posts seemed a little OTT.I'm just glad to be able to sleep at night more easily than before,and I have also stopped drinking tea,coffee,and all minerals.  Again thank you Yasser Mokhtar for your information,it is greatly appreciated\n\n",

    "content": "Ive had high bp now for years, been on toprol xl 100mg once a day for the past two years. I have pvc's off an on, chest pains(mostly in the left peck area, not central to my chest very much, under my left arm on my side as well), pains in my left shoulder / arm and hand. I also have fast and irregular heart beats sometimes or very slow heart beats at times *due to toprol?*  Ive have all kinds of blood work, a holter test, numerous ekg's... a stress test, chest xrays and they have all come back fine, durring the stress test all pvc's dissapear and i expierence no chest discomfort from excersise of any type.  Still i have reoccuring pains on a daily basis. Just today, march 30th i had a dual isotope excersise stress test, the ekg/stress test portion according to the doctor that does them at the hospital here said yet again he saw nothing bad except my bp shot up to 220/120 when my heart rate reached 150 beats a min. The imaging process i have no results on yet.  I also suffer from bad nerves and anxiety....as well as chronic stomach problems and copd *minor asthma and chronic bronchitus*  Im not sure as to what is causing these pains, by my doctors orders im trying to walk daily and am working on not smoking anymore.  So if the last test i have comes back normal and there is nothing wrong with my heart, then what can be causing these pains? My family doctor seems to be clueless, and hes a US Military doctor *rank is that under a one star general* so ya think he would be pretty good at figuring things out, but not on this one i take it.  Can ya offer any advice??\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Joshua,  You have 2 major risk factors for coronary disease, being a male and having hypertension. Your chest pain is atypical as compared to that of coronary disease. So, the probability that this pain be due to coronary disease i would say is very low to low.  Have you had an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to rule out a condition called mitral valve prolapse? This is a condition that is known to cause chest pain and palpitations and just needs to be watched.  In otherwise healthy young people who don't have heart disease, pvcs can be observed safely without worry or treatments. It is not unusual for healthy young people to have pvcs (and no cause is usually found). In the past, all pvcs were treated but not after a major study found that there is nothing to worry about in healthy young individuals without heart disease. You are already being treated for high blood pressure with a medication that should be controlling the pvcs. Did you have a holter while you were on toprol?  The pain that you are describing sounds to me like nerve pain more than anything else, i would recommend that you have an x-ray/ct scan of the neck to evaluate your cervical spine.

    "content": "Dear Joshua,  Thank you very much for the update.  There is nothing to worry about. If your cardiologist thought the stress test was positive, you would have been told and went for a more definitive way of diagnosis like a coronary angiogram. Your probability of having coronary disease was low from the begining, so there is no need to worry.   Murmurs do not necessarily mean that there is serious heart disease, and cardiologist are more experienced in listening to the heart, so, if your cardiologist did not hear a murmur, then i would assume that there is no murmur. An echocardiogram would be a good test in case of a murmur as it will show the valves and where the murmur is coming from.

    "title": "Re: Irregular heartbeats etc...query",
    "content": "Dear Claire,  You have to be evaluated by a health care professional. i can not tell what kind of arrhythmia you have just from what you said.  Palpitations have various causes including: 1. An overactive thyroid gland. 2. Electrolytes disturbance. 3. Mitral valve prolapse. 4. Smoking. 5. Drinking alcohol. 6. Drinking too much caffeinated beverages. 7. Not getting enough sleep. 8. Stress.  i would recommend that you have: 1. Blood tests to rule out thyroid problems and electrolyte disturbances. 2. Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to rule out mitral valve prolapse. 3. A holter monitor (24 hours portable heart monitor) to see what is the exact type of arrhythmia and how long it lasts.  It is very important to stop drinking, smoking and stop drinking any kind of caffeinated beverages including pop. Try to get enough sleep and rest. These measures help a lot of patients get rid of their symptoms.  In young healthy individuals with no organic heart disease, extra beats are not treated as they pose no danger as was shown by a major clinical study.

    "content": "I am healthy 43 year old mother of a 3 year old.  I have had PVCs for about 6 years.  I drink no caffeine and stay away from other stimulants such as wine and candy when I am having periods of PVCs.  They totally went away during my pregnancy but returned after I stoped breast feeding at about 9 months.  Since then (January 2003) they have been steadily getting worse each month.  Cardiologists keep saying to get used to them and have offered Lopressor which I have filled but never taken.  PVCs are very bad (every 5-6 beats during the week before my period and for first 3 days of my period).  Also are bad around ovulation.  Last week, the day before my period, I had a new sensation several times where heart beat really fast for about 10 seconds.  This happened in the middle of the night went I got up to go to the bathroom. This was very different from the usual PVC annoyance and it was very scary.  Two days later I had it again while in a store.  Is this related to the PVCs?  I take Synthroid .125 and Endocrinologist checks me regularly and dosage is fine.  I have always thought PVCs were related to my Thyroid problems (since that's how my Thryoidism was first diagnosed) but am now wondering if it is related to other hormones.  Could I be perimenopausal and this is making them worse?  Thanks in advance.\n\n",

If you are having anxiety over the pvcs, this anxiety might make the condition worse and it is not a bad idea as well to try a small dose tranquilizer for a short period of time and see whether it helps.  i know that your endocrinologist is checking you on regular basis but is there an upgoing trend in your thyroid tests even though they might be normal?  i don't think that there is a relation between hormonal imbalance during the climacteric period and pvcs.

    "content": "I have had sinus Tach for the last year.  I am awakened every morning after only 5 or 6 hours sleep with sinus tack, sometimes A Fib, pvcs, etc.  My BP runs low and my pulse is fast in early AM.  I have had it documented by an event monitor worn for 2 months.  I also get severe flashes and sweats.  Over the menopause.  I was sent to 2 Doctors for ablation possibility, and one wanted to do it, the other said wait.  I have had an echo, cardolite treadmill, and a lot of blood work.  All were normal.  I have difficulty taking beta blockers, and rythmol and other drugs in this area.  They make me very weak and I am intolerant of many meds.  It is a mystery why my pulse is high EVERY morning. I lay still and it drops and then when I get back to sleep it goes up again.  It drops after I am up about a half hour, and stays that way for most of the day and night.  Typically upon retiring my pulse is anywhere from 70 to 80.  The Sunus Tach is only in early AM when I am deeply asleep.  I just read that if your pulse remains high (they did not say, all day or intermittent) that I will have a heart attack within 3 years?  I am told not to worry about a stroke at this moment as I have not been in A Fib longer than 3 minutes or so at a time.  Not 24 hours.  I also have developed a platelet disorder this last year..... Do you have any advice or suggestions as to how I can solve this mystery?  I am besides myself, and exhausted a good deal of the time...I need help!!! Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sherie,  Most probably, this was done, but i think to try and get you down to the least (smallest) dose possible of synthroid would help. Checking all of the thyroid functions are in order as well (i know these were most probably the first blood tests done.  i think, it is a good idea to have an electrophysiologic study. You don't have to decide at that particular point whether or not to have an ablation, but you can think it over. But in my personal opinion, if you are already there and the catheters are in and everything is ready to go, the doctor can tell you the results and what needs to be done if you want him to go ahead with the ablation then, let it be.

    "content": "Dear Dr. Mokhtar, Thankyou so much for your reply, I so appreciate it.  I am on the lowest dose of Synthroid now, for my condition.  I had thyroid ablation for Graves disease in 1989, so I need replacement.  I just had my numbers redone and thyroid levels have gone up, TSH..... I feel better with that.  However, I still have atrial events, along with tack in the early AM. I understand that ablation is not where it should be for atrial fib and that it is somewhat successful for just sinus tach... as I am a bleeder, I tend to want to wait for the procedure.  I am afraid it is the only suggestion I am going to get at this point.  I wonder if you could tell me if my knowledge of having to be in AFib for 24 hours or more is the stroke factor?  Have you known of anyone that has been in it intermittently, as I am,  that has had a stroke?  That worries me every time I have an event. Actually, that is my biggest worry..  You are most kind to answer this post Warmest Regards and Thankyou  Sherie\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sherie,  Thank you very much for the update.  What do you mean by you being a bleeder?  There are certain arrhythmias that look exactly like sinus tachycardia and they are actually are not and they can be detected except by an electrophysiologic study, so an electrophysiologic study is actually not a bad idea.  As for the atrial fibrillation, there is an entity called paroxysmal atrial fibrillation where there are times where the patient is in atrial fibrillation and then reverts to sinus rhythm without intervention. Sometimes, people don't feel when they are in atrial fibrillation versus sinus rhythm and if the atrial fibrillation episode lasts more than 48 hours, then there is a higher risk for having a stroke. Usually, these patients are started on blood thinners to prevent strokes. If you are not sure how often and how long you are in atrial fibrillation then the best thing is to be started on blood thinners.   Atrial fibrillation causes embolization and one of the manifestations of embolization is getting a stroke but there are other manifestations for embolization such as having gangene of the legs or of the gut.

    "content": "Dear Dr. Mokhtar, Again, thankyou for the information.  I have a platelet disorder and bleed easily.  I was told that any procedure that I would have done in any area I would have to go to the hematologist to get some sort of shot first?  I just know I bruise terribly and am not on any blood thinners, nor do I take aspirin products.  So the ablation is something I could have a great deal of problems with!  The Electrophysiologist has suggested waiting until it gets worse.  I was diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation from the event monitor I wore for a month.  It showed atrial runs, atrial fib, and PVC, and sinus tach.  As I put in my first post, it happens every day. I thankyou for the information on strokes, as I fear that of course.  I understand baby aspirin is not enough any more, or as effective as they thought.  I was just trying to understand the 24 hour problem.  A Fib feels different from just sinus tach to me, as the heart feels like it is quivering and as a musician friend of mine says, it feels like an out of beat drummer..... I hope this explains better, all the complications for me...  You are most kind Thankyou Sherie\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Tachycardia",
    "content": "Dear Markos,  The first episode of tachycardia and hypertension was most probably related to all the stimulants that you took on that night.  For this new tachycardia, i would recommend that you stop all stimulants that you might be taking including coffee, tea, pop, anything that contains caffeine. You have to stop drinking any amount of alcohol and smoking any number of cigarettes.  Did you have blood tests when you went to the hospital the first time such as electrolytes in the blood? How about a thyroid function blood test?  You have to have a good night sleep. You have to have enough rest and stay away from stress.  If after all this, you still have the palpitations, i would suggest that you have a 24 hours heart monitor that will help to determine what is the rhythm that you have when you become tachycardic.  Concor is a beta blocker, it lowers both the blood pressure and the heart rate. What is the strength of the tablet that you are taking? The side effects that you are describing are most probably related to the concor.  Concor and all of the beta blocker group should never be stopped suddenly for any reason unless you discuss it with your doctor and has to be gradually weaned off of it.  There are other medications that can lower the blood pressure and the heart rate at the same time, this is the calcium channel blockers group. If the concor is giving you such hard time, i would suggest that you discuss switching to a medication that belongs to this group with your doctor.  Palpitations in young patients might point to a heart condition called mitral valve prolapse which is diagonsed by having an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) and only needs to be watched. So, i recommend that you have an ultrasound of the heart.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Lauren,  i don' t think that there have been enough big studies yet to say which way to go in which patients.  But, patients who develop peripartum cardiomyopathy and have persistent left ventricle dysfunction, are at a very high risk of complication during pregnancy and even death as pregnancy and labor pose a very high burden on the heart and circulation to begin with and these patients actually develop further reduction in their ejection fraction during pregnancy which means that their condition becomes worse. So, these patients are strongly advised not to become pregnant.   About patients whose ejection fraction improves, it was found in a small study that around 50% of these patients have deterioration in their ejection fraction during subsequent pregnancies and developed heart failure but there were no deaths reported.  i am not aware to which group of the above two you belong because i don't have this information, but there is no need to be upset or angry, i think you can always have a second opinion at a bigger tertiary care referral center.  If you belong to the second group and you were seen by a cardiologist who thought that you might become pregnant and all the risks that pregnancy to you and to your baby were discussed and you agreed to become pregnant, you have to understand that it is not going to be an easy process and that you will have to be watched very closely and carefully by obstetricicans with expertise in high risk pregnancy and cardiologists who have managed pregnant patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy before. And if you live in a smallish kind of town, it is not going to be easy commuting back and forth. You have to think about everything in advance and put everything into consideration before you chose to have this huge step as every detail will help you pass through pregnancy safely hopefully.

Please, make sure to check your thyroid tests if not already done.  If you had the 2 ablations for the same condition by the same operator and you think that you need a third procedure, i would suggest that you go to a second operator or to a bigger tertiary referral center.

    "content": "Hi, I have been experiencing a wide range of nerve problems it would seem, for the last 5 months.  2 Cspine and 1 Brain MRI have come out normal.  I just have a Q about a recent symptom I am having.  For the last 3-4 weeks, every night when I go to bed and fall asleep, I will awake about every 90 minutes.  Recently I have noticed that my heart may not be beating when I awake...I am still trying to test this though.  So i sorta have this theory that the reason I am being awakened all the time is because my heart completely stops beating and it wakes me.  And it seems to be not beating for quite a while, 5-10 seonds.  But this seems way to odd to me so I have kindof dismissed it.  Is this possible?  Or is it that when you sleep your heart rate is so slight I may not feel it.  Note that I can still breath fine and I do not wake gasping for air, although sometimes (i think) it feels like I awake holding my breath.  Also, I am only 125 lbs, I have always been slim and have always been able to feel my heart rate when putting my hand to chest.  Currently I am trying to test this theory by checking my pulse elsewhere, like neck and wrist.  No luck yet, either my heart has stopped or I'm too darn groggy to find a pulse.  If this is possible, any thoughts on cause?  Should I be worried?  Also, would it be ok to take say Ativan or something else to help me sleep, or would that be bad, because if my heart is going to stop I should want to wake up when it does!?  Thanks a lot,   Matt\n\n",

    "content": "Dear ctcarter,  i am not sure whether or not your son's supraventricular tachycardia is due to him taking ibuprofen. But if you remember that consistently, every time he is given ibuprofen, he goes into supraventricular tachycardia then there is a very strong chance that this superventricular tachycardia is caused by ibuprofen intake. This tachycardia could be related to your son's viral illness if he gets it consistently every time he has this viral illness also. So, if he takes ibuprofen every time he gets this viral illness, then it is going to be difficult to say which one is causing the tachycardia.   You are right, taking medications when they are not needed is not a good thing. i think it is a legitimate question to ask your son's doctor about when this medication is going to be stopped. Does your son experience the superventricular tachycardia even when he is on sotalol when he gets ibuprofen or suffers from the viral illness?   Please, don't stop your son's medication without getting back to his doctor first.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "Dear justwinbaby8,  Skipped beats are nothing to worry about in otherwise healthy young adult.  Palpitations or one feeling his/her heart beats can be caused by: 1. An overactive thyroid gland. 2. Electrolytes disturbance. 3. Mitral valve prolapse. 4. Smoking. 5. Drinking alcohol. 6. Drinking too much caffeinated beverages. 7. Not getting enough sleep. 8. Stress.   A murmur is a sound heard over the heart when there is a disturbance in blood flow. According to the type of murmur, it may point to a heart problem or just what is known as innocent murmurs.  i think there is nothing to worry about but If you are so worried, i don't think that you need to see your doctor on emergent basis, but just mention it to your doctor when you see him during your next appointment and may have blood tests done if he/she thinks that they are indicated.

    "content": "I was hoping to get confirmation about Tachycardia. I am in the process of trying to find out why my white blood count is elevated. My doctor (I am assuming) is thinking I have a UTI. I just finished taking Cipro and my white cell count did not lower, so I am waiting on the results from my urine culture. In the meantime I am really stressed over my Tachycardia. This has not been confirmed by my doctor yet. I went to the ER on Dec. 30th and that was what my paperwork said that they thought I had. I am currently on Toprol, which I am having anxiety over, because I am afraid it will drop my pulse rate too low. The symptoms I have when t I have an \"episode\" are: A warm feeling comes over my body, I get a little dizzy and feel like I could pass out. Sometimes I feel pressure in the chest and both arms feel warm, and then I get chills and it subsides. I haven't noticed if my heart is racing during the last few attacks. In fact, the last episode I had only lasted a few minutes. I had no chest discomfort but everything else. I think this one was brought on by stress. I had come home that day and had a message on the answering machine from my doctor to call them. I became very upset because I was going to have to wait another day before I knew my results. (This was to find out if the Cipro helped my white blood count). Why wouldn't Cipro help?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Penny,  Tachycardia is a general term which in simple plain english means a fast heart rate.  Tachycardia is of many types.   Did they tell you in the er what they thought the type of tachycardia was?   If you have a uti, then a tachycardia can be caused by this uti.  A high white count can be caused by many causes, one of which is infection. Did you have any sypmtoms suggestive of uti, did your urine analysis show that you have a uti? Did you have any other symptoms that could suggest other infection sites like a cold, sore throat, sinus infection, a skin infection?  Cipro should help a simple uti and other infections as well. If the high white count was due to an infection, then cipro should help get it down.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "The paperwork the ER gave me said I possibly had acute symptomatic tachycardia.  My doctor (the one that put me on the Cipro) said I [b]might [/b]have a UTI. And after I had taken the Cipro , he had me go for another CBC and a urine culture. The urine culture came back negative, but my white blood count was still high. (14.1) After the Dr. looked through my records he noticed my white blood count had always been a little elevated. So he told me to come back in 3 weeks for another CBC. (Which is next week)  I wasn't having any kind of symptoms of anything at all.  Thank you, I didn't know that a UTI could cause Tachycardia, that makes me feel a little better.  The Toprol lowered my pulse down to 53  over the weekend (which scared me,) so the next day I took only  1/4 of a 50 mg. (I was taking 1/2) I had called the doctor to tell them about my pulse and I told the nurse that I knew you can't just quit taking Toprol so I took a 1/4 of a pill instead of a 1/2 and she said that was what she would do.  I am feeling better, I haven't had another \"episode\" and I would really like to quit taking the Toprol. (I am having anxiety over it, due to it lowering my pulse) If I don't need it.  My next Dr. appointment is not until June 24th.   I was just hoping for another opinion on this Tachycardia thing. It really scares me.   Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Penny,  Thank you very much for the update.  The er report does not really help because it does not mention whether the tachycardia that you had was normal rhythm but faster than normal or both abnormal in rhythm and rate. Did they do an ekg and if yes what did it show?  You did well by not stopping the toprol suddenly. You need to take the lowest dose of any medication that would accomplish the desired effect. In this case, not to let your heart rate go any faster than it should.  In addition to the warm feeling over your body, the dizziness, the pressure in the chest, and the chills, do you have any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, sweating, feeling that your face is flushed, ever had shortness of breath, wheezing, diarrhea, periods have been irregular recently? How long have you been having those attacks, are you allergic to any medications or any thing in the environement?  Loestrin can sometimes cause some emotional lability and some symptoms close to what you have been experiencing. How long have you been taking the loestrin and do you think there is a correlation between loestrin and these symptoms?  From your description and you relating these episodes to stress, these could be panic attacks although i usually don't like to blame panic for any symptom unless absolutely sure that there is nothing physical to blame.  i think if you have not been having any fast heart rate recently, this can be either because the toprol is having a good effect or because you don't need it. At this point, you can call your doctor and ask him if you could stop the toprol and see your response to that.

In fact, when I went to my ob/gyn in January I asked her if she thought I had been on them too long. She went on to say that women can stay on them for as long as they want.   To your post, the ER did an EKG, and my original doctor said it was normal. (Dec. 30th was my first attack) I have only had one other attack (tachycardia?) and it was while I was in class about a month ago. (I am a 35 year old college student ). In fact, I walked out of class and went home. But that was the last episode I have had.  In addition to the Toprol, I have been taking 1/2 of a .5 mg. alpralozam (xanax). I only take it when I feel nervous or edgy though.   Also, I don't really have diarrhea, but I have had loose stools for quite some time which I told my Dr. about it on several occasions.  He didn't say anything. I have not had any other symptoms other than a few months ago I was having irregular periods, but I assumed  it was because I missed my birth control pill.   Tomorrow I go for my blood work to see if my white blood count is down and I am also going for a chest x-ray. I plan to ask my doctor if I can quit taking the Toprol when I call for my results.   Thank you for your responses, I am a little more relaxed about it.\n\n",

If you get those attacks more frequently with fast heart beats, i think it would be worthwhile to wear a 24 hours heart monitor called Holter monitor to try and record the tachycardia episode when it happens so that we can find out exactly what kind of tachycardia this is, but as i said before, if during the episode, your ekg was normal, then you did not have any tachycardia.

So I don't think I need to take it. And I am having a little anxiety about taking it especially after my pulse was low that one day.   I have a lot of stressful situations going on in my life and at the time of the first \"episode\" , I was really stressed. So I am thinking and hoping that I just had an anxiety attack and hope I can figure out a way to deal with my stress without relying on the Xanax.   I really, really appreciate you discussing this with me. My doctor's office is so busy it is hard to get through and when I do, I have to talk to the nurse and she is always so busy.

My heart didn't race with this one. This time I had a hot flash, felt like I was going to pass out and just didn't feel right. After, lying down for an hour,  I had a weird pain in my upper chest. I started feeling around and felt a small knot that was very painful to the touch. I thought that was a gland. I went to the Dr. on Wednesday, my BP was 136/90. The doctor did an EKG, which was normal and felt my little knot. Turns out that is not a gland it was the edge of my breast tissue. Went for a mammogram on Thursday and of course more blood testing and a 24 hour urine. The mammogram came back normal, the Radiologist said that it was Fibrous tissue and the pain was normal. The doctor said he is checking my blood for a particular thing, I am not sure what, he did not go into detail. I think we are getting close to nipping this in the bud. I am feeling alot better than I had when I was on the Toprol. I am hoping my little \"episode\" on Monday was a withdrawal symptom. My Dr. said that was possible.  I have an appointment to go to a Neurologist June 10th for the tingling I am having in my face ( I forgot to mention that). And I have also lost about 15 pounds in the last 3 months. I told the Dr. that I haven't really been eating right and I have totally quit drinking sodas, which I would drink several a day. I haven't really worried about the weight loss until recently, I am having more and more people notice it.  Do you know what the Dr. could be checking my blood for? I am having a complete metabolic panel, I think a Thyroid test, (T-4) and a 24 hour urine. Thanks again for your help. I am feeling pretty confident that I am not having heart trouble.\n\n",

    "content": "After dealing with an ulcer and Panic attacks? for a year (dealing with them), I am back. Last Thursday, I went to the doctor for a follow up on my duodenal ulcer. On the way, I witnessed a car accident. It really made me nervous and when I got to the doctors office my blood pressure and pulse rate had gone up. I told the nurse what happened and told her that I thought my blood pressure would be high. My blood pressure was 176/96. They waited about 15 minutes and it had come down to 150/92.  I was also nervous about going to the doctor. When the doctor came in he checked my blood pressure and it had gone back up to 160/96 and my heart rate was 100. He listened to my heart via my back, my throat and chest. He suggested that I get on a beta blocker. I told him I had just seen an accident and was really nervous. But he said we needed to control the Tachycardia. He has prescribed Atenolol. I am terrified of taking a drug that lowers the heart rate, I have taken Toprol before and it lowered my pulse rate down to 53, so I got off of it. My questions are these: I have these type \"events\" sporadically, Is it really necessary to start a beta blocker for sporadic events? Could this have been a panic attack? I have yet to get confirmation of the panic attacks. I have a blood pressure machine that I use at home daily and my blood pressure is normally decent (anywhere from 128/80 to 138/90) but my pulse rate is normally around 88-95, while working ( I am a secretary.. no stress, ) or resting it has been as low as 63.\n\n",

In my personal opinion, if you just had sinus tachycardia, i don't think that you need to be treated unless you have coronary disease and your pulse should be controlled.   To diagnose hypertension, an elevated blood pressure should be found on more than 2 occasions during the same week. If during three different occasions (not the same day), high blood pressure is found, then this needs to be treated.  Atenolol is also used to control high blood pressure.   i can not tell you not to take the medication that your doctor prescribed, but you have to discuss it with your doctor if you think you don't want to take the medication because you don't need it or are concerned about side effects.

After 6 months I was back in the ER because I couldn't stop my heart on my own.  They took an EKG and faxed it to my cardiologist.  I called and scheduled another ablation proceedure and went in the day before for my check up.  My cardiologist did not remember doing my initial procedure which was fine because I know he is very busy.  I went in the next morning and had the proceedure done.  Afterwards he came in to see me and said he couldn't get my heart into the rhythm and so just did a clean up on the initial site and was done.  this only took 2 hours.  I know many other patients of his can be in the ablation proceedure for up to 4 to 6 hours.    My last ablation proceedure was done in August 2004.  I have now started having symptoms again.  My doctor has decided to put a monitor on me.  My questions are simple.  Why didn't my doctor use the EKG from the last episode which his nurse told me is better than catching it on the monitor?  And why didn't my doctor try harder to get my heart into the rhythm during the proceedure?  Should I see another doctor or stay with this one?\n\n",

But it sounds from your story that this is a case of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia.  There are at least three types of ventricular tachycardia and i don't know which type you have. But two of them can be trigerred by exercise, how much exercise, i can not tell. Whether heavy lifting can trigger, i suppose it can, so, i would recommend not do heavy lifting like weight lifting at this time. About drinking alcohol and smoking, it is recommended that you abstain completely.  Since you are still symptomatic and you are young and it is not easy to live such a life with lots of restrictions, i would recommend you going to a cardiologist specialized in arrhythmias called an electrophysiolgist to have an electrophysiolgical study to try and locate the origin of this ventricular tachycardia and may be ablate it and get rid of the ventricular tachycardia.

Did he tell you what type of irregular heart rhythm was it?  There are certain types of irregular heart rhythms that have to be treated.  i need more information, please, to try to answer the question the best i can.

    "content": "Dear Dr. Mokhtar,  Thank you for your reply!  I am a little ignorant in medicine, but I will try to answer your questions. At first it was my grandmother who noticed it! She is someone who makes sure everyone is healthy and she checks everyone's pulse periodically, especially me, her only granddaughter. That was about 10 years ago. I had a full physical last November and the doctor noticed something, I can not remember how he did the heart check. Then they decided to do the test and I had to wear a heart monitor thing for three days with the tape recorder that was recording the heartbeat at all times.  There were many wires about me =)  I can not remember what kind of irregular heart beat this is, I think it is an irregular irregular heart beat, because I just checked my pulse, and there was NO pattern there. And I remember something that my friend said, she is a traditional medicine person. She said that the \"regular irregular\" heart beat is indicative of a definite problem, while \"irregular irregular\" heart beat is better.  This is all I can really tell. I can try and call teh doctor. I live in a different state right now, but I will contact the doctor on Monday and ask him that.  Thank you very much for your help and I hope that whatever I asnwered today may help =)\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mike,  It looks like you were not taking any medications that could affect your heart rate.   Are you an athlete? Do you perform heavy and strenuous regular exercise? What was your heart rate both resting and during exercise before all that started to happen? How long have you had these symptoms?  i think a thyroid function test called tsh should be performed if not already done as an underactive thyroid gland is well known to cause bradycardia.  It looks like they ruled out the major causes of bradycardia. Stress test, echo and ct scan were done.    One thing to add. Even though i don't think that this is the case, the granulomas in your lungs together with bradycardia could be caused by a disease called sarcoidosis that affects the lungs and heart. But it should have been picked up by the ct scan and the echo, so it was ruled out as well.  Since no other abnormality was detected and you are still symptomatic, i guess that you are having the begining of early degeneration of the electrical and conducting system of your heart. i think the next best step to do is to see a cardiologist specialized in the electrical and conducting system of the heart called an electrophysiologist. If he thinks it is necessary, he will conduct an electrophysiologic study of your heart to study the electrical and conducting system of your heart and then decide whether you need treatment or not. In such cases, treatment is a pacemaker.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank- you for your reply.     I have worked as a framing carpenter most of my life, and kept very active, the chronic fatigue and syncope has only been occassional since haveing Bells Palsy in 2001. At that time my heart-rate at rest was 65, stress unknown. Holter report while hospitalized for duration of 15:30:00 Heart-rates were: 39 Mininum, 53 Average, 83 Maximum, 0 beats in tachycardia, 43371 beats in Bradycardia- 88% total. BP 100/60. Thyroid levels were: T4 Free- 0.94, TSH- 4.30. EEG was normal. I am awaiting insurance acceptance before referral to cardiologist. My fatigue has increasingly gotten worse, am I in any immediate danger from what you see in the test results? Thank-you,    Mike Rickard\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mike,   i don't think that you are in immediate danger from what the test results said.   i would suggest that when you feel the most fatigued to try and take your pulse see if it is really slow.  i did not mention that in my previous reply but there are sometimes brain problems that can cause bradycardia and near syncope. So, i would suggest that you have a ct scan of the brain and a carotid/vertebral dupplex done to rule this possibility out. Some people also are investigated by an eeg (brain electrical activity drawing) if they lost consciousness but if you have not, there is no need for that.  Otherwise, there is nothing else to do except wait for that visit to the cardiologist. Most probably you will have a tilt-table test and may be that electrophysiology study that i mentioned before.

    "title": "Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia",
    "content": "Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia (resting HR 110-135), peaking to 170+ with limited activity, accompanied by shortness of breath, chest pressure/pain, palpaltations, fatigue, and not responding to beta blocker (50mg).  Beta Blocker at this dosage drops blood pressure to below 95/65 and cannot be increased but has not had any major impact on heart rate. (For a short period, lowered peak from 170 to 140 but resting rate is now usually over 130).  Also, Beta Blocker has resulted in lower pulse pressure (often <20), resulting in lightheadedness, dizziness and near fainting.  24-Hr. Holter showed sinus tachycardia throughout.  Stress test 1 year ago showed downsloping ST Depression.  Angiogram 1 year ago revealed nothing of significance (40%).  All other causes of Tachycardia have been ruled out.  Question is:  Is this a benign condition (apart from the serious quality of life issue that has developed)?  Have had differing opinions with regard to this.  I have been told by one physician that only \"rarely\" does this result in cardiomyopathy and is benign otherwise.  Have been told by another that it is not a \"benign condition\" and \"can\" result in \"damage\" to the heart muscle.  So, just asking for a third opinion here.   Regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Inappropriate sinus tachycardia",
    "content": "Dear Fearuvhorses,  i don't want to ask you, were you checked for such and such because you were clear about having everything that can cause tachycardia checked. i hope that you are not drinking too much coffee, tea or alcoholic beverages. You can also take a look at my previous replies to your questions if you have not already done so.  This also can be a condition called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome which is usually associated with chronic fatigue.   Have you had an echocardiogram? Ever seen a cardiologist for this tachyacrdia? There is an arrythmia called sinus node re-entry tachycardia that can look exactly like sinus tachycardia.   There are medications that can slow the heart rate and not affect the blood pressure like digoxin and amiodarone.   Tachycardia on the long run can cause cardiomyapthy but this is more related to ectopic atrial tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia and not sinus tachycardia.  At this point, if you have not seen a cardiologist specialized in arrhytmias, my advice is to do so and have a specialized study called electrophysiologic study (e.p.s.) to see whether this is truly sinus tachycardia or if it is another supraventricular arrhythmia disguising as sinus tachycardia.

    "title": "Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia",
    "content": "There is no cardiologist at our regional hospital.  All heart patients are seen by one of two internists.  There is no electrophysiologist.  When I had the angiogram done a year ago I was airlifted to the University Hospital 6 hours away.  I had a heart ultrasound in January and got the results two weeks ago.  The internist says I have POTS (which explains why I get dizzy or faint if I stand up too fast) and inappropriate sinus tachycardia.  He also said that I have some \"thickening\" of the left side of the heart.  His solution was to double the Beta-Blocker to 100 mg/day.  I was only able to take it for a few days.  I had the flu for a few days after and was unable to keep anything down.  For the past few days I have been so nauseated and dizzy that I have not been taking any medication even though I am no longer vomiting.   My heart rate has dropped to between 45 and 60 so going back to the Beta-Blocker does not seem necessary.  (I wonder what it is when I am sleeping???!!!)\n\n",
