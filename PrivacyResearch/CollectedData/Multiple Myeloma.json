    "content": "I am 50years old and about 3months ago, I was referred to Oncologist because I had elevated protein level. At the time Oncologist said IGA protein and advised 1200. I had Bone Marrow Biopsy which only showed abnormal plasma cells but no cancer. CT Scan, Xrays all came out normal. I repeated the Serum Protein Electrophesis and Oncologist said it went up to 1500 and he will monitor for MM but nothing he can do for me right now, but he says, he is concern. What does all this mean for me. I am confused. I am nauseated all the time, dizziness, constipated and within the last 2 weeks developed foamy urine. Please help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Iahching,  I suspect your doctor is just as frustrated as you are.  Occasionally, we have patients where we know something is going on but we can't \"prove\" it.  In your case, the elevated IgA protein levels and the abnormal plasma cells signal that there is something going on.  It sounds like the problem is that at this point a firm diagnosis cannot be made.  Because of this, a proper treatment cannot be chosen so the best thing to do is continue to follow up very closely with your doctor and wait for signs to appear that can make a definite diagnosis.   Close follow up is crucial so that the diagnosis can be made as early as possible.    Your foamy urine is likely due to increased protein levels in the urine.  Best wishes and I hope you are able to figure this out soon.\n\n",

    "content": "This is a very individualized answer.  I think it is unlikely that any particular level of IgA would be an indication to start chemotherapy.  Instead, I suspect that your doctor will want to monitor the IgA level in addition to other possible symptoms of multiple myeloma to help make a decision.  If more symptoms begin to appear it is likely your doctor will want to begin treatment.  These situations can be very difficult.  Hang in there.  I wish you the best.\n\n",

    "content": "I had blood transfusion about a year ago due to severe anemic for about 6 months. About a month after I started the transfusion I developed a rash on my right foot inside my ankle and it spread around the front part of my foot. Then my left foot started. The tip of my pointer finger right hand developed a dry skin rash and it spread to the base of my finger and then to my thumb on the same hand. My left leg inside from my ankle to below my knee started and then my right arm only on the outside from the middle of my hand, over the elbow and up my arm. Then it started on my left upper back on my left shoulder. And most recently after a Biopsy done on my right arm, it started on my right forearm and up my neck in the back on the left side from my left shoulder and also on my right leg from inside my ankle to just below my knee. I had taken multiple types and doses of Antibiotics, Creams, Steroidal Creams, Fungus, Steroids orally and nothing worked. Over the year, it progressed to the different areas as I mentioned and over the year I was referred by my Oncologist back to my regular doctor to find out if there is anything else going on with me. After referrals and referrals over the whole year between  Dermatologist, to an Allergist and to another Dermatologist, and a Biopsy, it was diagnosed today that it was a Blood Allergy and possibly relating to MM and now I am referred right back to my Oncologist. I was advised by the Dermatologist today there is no medicine to cure it except Steroids only to try and make me comfortable , a month supply and Aquaphor to soothe my body. I am very frustrated and confused that it took a year between the different specialists and then to tell me it is an internal blood matter and there is nothing to cure it. The skin reaction on these various parts of my body all look different and doctor said it is because its a blood disease. Some areas have a rash form, my legs have more of red bumps all over, my fingers and thumbs have very dry cracked and pulling my skin. Do you have any comments about all this to make me understand why and what is happening to me. The Dermatologist and the Allergist both confirmed that I have no allergy, nor Skin infection or disease or Skin Cancer but has to do with my blood. Please help with some explanation and information. Help please. Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I hope your friend is doing well. Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement with multiple myeloma is extremely rare. It is diagnosed by finding malignant plasma cells in the spinal fluid by lumbar puncture. This is usually ordered after a patient with myeloma presents with CNS symptoms that are suspicious.   Usually these patients have advanced disease and various chromosomal abnormalities such as del 13q and p53 mutations. These abnormalities confer poor prognosis.  Unfortunately, there are two few cases to draw general conclusions about what may happen to your friend but most of these cases have been treated with CNS directed therapy (eg, intrathecal chemotherapy) as well as bone marrow transplants.  Sadly, most of the cases reported in the literature do not do well altogether. However, like I said there are too few of those and any generalization would be stated with caution.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Abnormal Lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).   Sometimes, following infection Lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection.  An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.   Bilateral and contralateral metastases from lateral tongue cancers are uncommon bu occur. I advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear jenlyn95,  The 5-year survival rate for MM patients treated with conventional therapy is  20%-25% for those older than 65 years. About 30%-50% of  newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients are expected to be unresponsive to chemotherapy.  The criteria for partial response are: \u25a0 > 50% reduction in serum myeloma protein \u25a0 > 90% reduction in Bence Jones protein. Criteria for complete response include: \u25a0 disappearance of serum myeloma protein and Bence Jones protein by immunofixation \u25a0 no monoclonal plasma cells in bone marrow.  Thalidomide (Thalomid) can be uses alone and in combination with dexamethasone as upfront therapy in newly diagnosed patients. Thalidomide Alone, produces 50% reduction in paraprote in 36% of patients; and in up to 72% when given in combination.  Thalidomide shows superior results compared to dexamethasone alone but comparable to VAD (vincristine, Adriamycin [doxorubicin], and dexamethasone).   Care should be taken with any symptoms suggestive of thrombotic complications since high rateof thrombosis was found in patients receiving this drug.  Other regimens used for treatment of newly diagnosed MM patients are: -VAD (vincristine, Adriamycin [doxorubicin], and dexamethasone). -MP The combination of melphalan and prednisone has been used over the past 30 years but they cause damage to bone marrow cells and affect the bone marrow reserve. -Pulse dexamethasone alone is commonly used in patients who are going to receive Radiation therapy.  In those who are resistant e can be offered one of the following therapies:   - Combination Chemotherapy.  High doses of alkylating agents, alone or in combination are proved to be effective in these patients.  Examples of these regimens are:  IV melphalan (70-100 mg/m2)  The combination of high-dose cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan,  Neosar) and etoposide.   - Novel agents have shown good activity in the disease control and studies on these drugs are still going on, these agents include:  IMiD Revimid thalidomide analog with immunomodulatory effects.  Proteasome inhibition Bortezomib  Arsenic trioxide (Trisenox)  I advise you to follow with her doctor and to trust his judgment since he seems to be very careful in providing her the best  treatment options.

    "content": "My 69 yr. old mother was diagnosed with MM 2 months ago. She was considered Stage II at diagnosis with a Beta 2 Micro level of 3.6 and albumin 3.9.  She has kappa light chain disease and has had arthritis for many years. She's had 2 cycles of doxil, vincristine and dexamethasone.  After the first cycle the doctor told us that she may only have to do 3 cycles since her numbers looked so good.  We were elated since she has been accepted for a autologous stem cell transplant in Atlanta (providing she is physically ready).  Two days ago, the doctor told her that he didn't like her protein numbers (kappa had gone from 9.54 before treatment, to 5.0 after first chemo, to 6.0 after second treatment.  Her total proteins are now 8.5, up from 8.0. She doesn't seem to have any kidney problems, but does have degenerated L3 & L4 disks with back pain when she's off the dex.  The dex also causes extreme difficulty with sleeping.  She's taken 8 different sleep meds but has finally settled on Remeron 30mg with about 1 1/2-2mg of xanax per night and this gives her from 4-6 hours of sleep.  I left my teaching job to help dad care for mom and we are now feeling very anxious about everything.  Can you tell me what our options might be if this chemo treatment fails?  Are there other combinations she could try?  Do we then go to some of the newer drugs like Velcade or Revlimid or what??   I thought Emory said they would consider doing a transplant even if a person wasn't in remission...is this possible??  Originally the doctors gave us the impression that mom probably had 3-7 years to live with the new advances happening in this area but now we just feel confused and frankly, frightened.   Any information you would be willing to share would be greatly appreciated!!  Thanks\n\n",

Examples of these regimens are: IV melphalan (70-100 mg/m2)  The combination of high-dose cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, Neosar) and etoposide.  - Thalidomide is of role in treatment of  refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma,  and shows 50% reduction in paraprotein in almost 30% of patients. Remissions obtained are durable.  - Novel agents have shown good activity in the disease control and studies on these drugs are still going on, these agents include: IMiD Revimid  thalidomide analog with immunomodulatory effects. Proteasome inhibition Bortezomib Arsenic trioxide (Trisenox)  I advise you to follow up with her doctor for proper management.  Best regrads,\n\n",

    "title": "Confused about diagnosis? MM or MGUS.",
    "content": "Dear Doctor, I am a 35 year old female. In 2005 I began seeing a rheumatologist for pain I was having in my back and ribs. She ran a few test wich included an ESR, CMP, and a immunoelectrophoresis. Everything came back normal except the immuno. electr. It showed a monoclonal gamopathy with a 2gram IGG peak. I in turn I was sent to a hematologist. He proceeded to do a bone marrow. The bone marrow showed 10% plasma cells in the marrow and 10-20% in the periphearal blood stream. With plasmacytes. The markers I can't remember off hand but they  leaned  toward MM. Expect for I didn't have chromosome 13.(I am writing this from memory). Now I get confused here. My first two check-ups after the reults my Dr. talked in terms of MGUS. Now this last visit he talked in terms of myeloma. He says nothing has changed.( I do not know my Beta-2 reults. As of Sept. 2005 no bence jones.) I still have four weeks befor I return. I know the ramifications of this disease I am MLT. I just want to know where I stand. Is this truely a smoldering myeloma or a MGUS. I need to know how to prepare. I have to small children. I plan on asking my Dr. more questions when I go back. Four weeks is a long time to wonder.  I also have no punch lesions. H&H normal. CA runs low. Albumin runs around 3.3, Total Protien around 7.6.   Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "My mother's rheumatologist told her she needed to speak with an oncologists as soon as possible because of outcomes of two blood tests. Both tests showed a M-spike (one test was done in July and the other in September) The test in July showed a small spike (?) while the test in September showed an increase in the spike.  She was not informed of the spike in July b/c the doctor felt that it was just age related (she is 63). Her sed rate was 30 in September. The pathologist suggested two other tests be completed : serum immunofixation or urine electrophoresis.  Do only oncologists perform these tests?   Side note: Her doctors have also found a growth in her liver and a growth on the outside of her liver and 6 or more nodules on her thyroid.  She is always tired, bruises easily, sick to her stomach and dizzy (to the point of falling over).  She also has occult blood in her urine   (is that normal?)  I guess I am looking for someone to tell me if I need to be concerned  and stay on her about the oncologist or if this is just a process of aging.     Any information is appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Signs of death from multiple myeloma",
    "content": "My mother is 73 years old and was diagnosed approximately 5 years ago with mulitple myeloma.  At that time, she refused most treatments including chemo and stem cell replacement.  Now, the doctors believe she is too frail and sickly to endure those treatments.  For the past year, her treatments have included radiation, pamidronate, and steroids and fentanal patch and morphine.  The doctors now believe her time is imminent and in fact as we speak she is in hospital.  Unfortunately our wonderful, caring doctors cannot pinpoint a time of death, and we understand this is not very easy or always accurate.  As her family though, what we are wondering is if there are certain signs that could clue us in to a more accurate timeframe.  We would like to have some time as a family to plan and prepare ourselves better and to just know. Currently her signs and symptoms are:  bad headaches, rattly sound in chest, hard time to breath, immense pain throughout, very swollen and discolored feet and legs, confusion, disorientation, immense weakness and fraility.  When given hydration, blood and pamidronate these signs get better for a few days to week and then return. Although I understand how difficult this question is looking for a more accurate timeframe for how long she may have left, I wonder if there is statistics or information that says generally patients with certain symptoms and/or signs have generally passed on within days, weeks, months of the start of these signs or symptoms. Please help this family.\n\n",

    "title": "Death and Dying",
    "content": "The process of death and dying is woefully ignored all too often at the clinical level. And if there is a way to answer your question with the certainty you seem to be looking for, it eludes me. Perhaps one of the other volunteers can offer their insight.  Bernie Siegel, MD, once told a large group of doctors in a conference setting that he would put up one-year of his salary against the one-year salary of any \"taker\" if the challenger could take a set of pathology reports from a cancer patient, and, predict within a 30-day window, either side of the actual date of demise, when the patient would die.  Despite there being about 200 well trained, experienced oncologists, hematologists and internal medicine specialists in the room, there was not a single taker. At that particular point in time, Dr. Siegel's salary ran to a seven-figure sum.  I have had a number of family membenrs tell me that they watched a loved one struggle against death, which is distinctly different that a patient struggling for life, until that person was told by family members that it was alright for them to pass on - after assuring them that it was, in essence, alright for them to die. Equally important though is the need to be mindful that an ill loved one must be supported in their decision to fight for their life.  If your mom has a living will, or any end-of-life type directives, and if she is truly incapable of making a decision about her wishes at this terribly straining moment, then family members are acting appropriately when they discuss the patient's wishes in this regard with the physician. Prolonging life functions for the mere sake of supporting bodily function is not always what the patient truly wants or even needs.  Having said that, let me hasten to add that hope is a cardinal emotion in all of us. Nothing should ever be done to quell the hope any patient at any time. If your mom is indeed trying to recover, perhaps even with the modest goal of just getting well enough to leave the hospital and pass away at home, I'd support her wholeheartedly in that, were she my mother.  In summary. patients described as being in a lot worse shape than you describe your mom have been known to recover, dramatically, and walk out of hospitals. Younger persons with fewer problems have been known to die without much warning.  I'd suggest listening carefully to your mother, get a good handle on her wishes, than support her as best you can.\n\n",

I know that it's more complicated than a simple blood test and involves light chains etc.  I was diagnosed a year ago and my protein level was 460.  Over a few months it escalated to 9,000.  I received radiation to the one tumor on my pelvis and it immediately dropped dramatically to 1,300.  It has, for the past 3 months, stayed below 200, even being as low as 86.  I thought I was in remission but was told no.  Amazingly, I don't  have any renal damage and even though I do recive Procrit shots off and on, my level has never been lower than 11.5 and I seem to be doing fine.  My biggest complaint is my weight gain.  I have gained nearly 50 pounds.  So, my questions are, what constitutes remission and is the weight gain abnormal?  Thanks so much.  Linda\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Lindah,  As you probably know multiple myeloma is a malignant disease of the plasma cells. The main function of these cells is to produce plasma proteins (immunoglobulins). Certain gene rearrangements lead to exessive production of plasma proteins via the malignant plasma cells leading to exess protein in blood and to many of the complications and manifestations of the disease.  As you respond to therapy (e.g. the radiotherapy you received) more malignant plasma cells die and this decreases the production of plasma proteins.  There are two types of complete remissions (CRs): a clinical CR and a molecular CR.   Criteria for clinical CR include disappearance of bony lesions in skeletal x-rays, normal plasma proteins, normal blood counts, normal electrophoresis and normal plasma cell rates on bone marrow examination.  Weight gain may be a result of therapy or due to renal affection (not in your case). Please get a lipid profile done to adjust your blood lipids and try to maintain a healthy diet if required.\n\n",

    "content": "3 years ago my mother was diagnosed with Multiple Myleoma.  She underwent six months of chemotherapy, her cancer went into remission and her stem cells were harvested.  Unfortuantely, the chemo was hard on her lungs and she had to be on oxygen for 3 months following the harvest of stem cells.  The doctors decided not to go through with the stem cell transplant at that time.  The cancer was in remission for 2.5 years and has recently relapsed.  She am currently taking Dextramethosone (sp?) and has been told that the 'transplant team' will assess her capability of undergoing the stem cell transplant.  If the transplant is not possible (due to her lung capacity), we are told she has 6 months to a year left.  Is there any other clinical test drugs  which she can try or other treatments available? (such as thalidamide - which I've heard has been successful)  She is only 56 years old and is otherwise healthy, she's not quite ready to give up yet--and we don't really want to see her go yet.  Any responses are appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Light chain",
    "content": "Angel,  Heavy and light chains can appear in the blood due to primary disorders (multiple myeloma is an example) but these can also be elevated due to a reactive state caused by other unrelated illnesses or problems affecting the body.  The C-reactive protein can be elevated in a reactive state as well.  Light chains are cleared by the kidneys and thus can appear in the urine and not so much in the blood.  You do not mention if any specialized testing was done on the blood or the urine to determine if the light chains seen are monoclonal (such is the case in multiple myeloma, for example) or \"reactive\".  How elevated were the light chains in the urine?  Amyloidosis produces similar proteins, although it is a different disease than multiple myeloma.  Sometimes the two disorders overlap.  If the light chain is slightly elevated in the urine and no monoclonality to it is seen, then I would repeat it.  If the blood does not reveal any monoclonal proteins, then still one needs to check the urine since if a blood disorder were to be present, then it may just produce light chains and not heavy chains.  The higher a heavy or light chain is detected and found to be monoclonal, the more likely that a multiple myeloma or related process is at play.  However, it is important to note that light chains can be elevated and not be monoclonal - again, this can be seen in a reactive state and does not imply a blood disorder.  If one wants to continue an evaluation for multiple myeloma or amyloidosis, then a bone marrow biopsy may be helpful.  For amyloidosis, a biopsy of a fat pad (such as near the belly button or near the rectum) can be done as well.  A Congo red stain will be positive in amyloidosis.  There are different forms of amyloidosis.  Can you post the results of your blood and urine tests?  That would be helpful.\n\n",

Have any further tests been done to try to figure out the cause(s) of your symptoms and problems?  Sounds to me that further testing is in order.   An uncommon presentation of multiple myeloma is the so-called \"non-secretory\" type of myeloma, wherein no proteins are produced by the abonormal plasma cells.  If one is to be thorough in evaluating your situation, from a Hematology-Oncology point of view, then I would definitely  perform a bone marrow biopsy.  In addition, although amyloioisis can be diagnosed based upon a bone marrow biopsy, this is not 100% the case, so a fat pad biopsy (such as the gums, rectal area or near the umbilicus (belly button) is also done.\n\n",

Im all ears..and would  travel to Egypt and back if I thought I would get an answer.   oh one more thing, if My heart stays in this R high output failure, will it continue to enlarge? and what does that mean for my health if it does.                        Difficult patient, Angel B\n\n",

I don't know where you are receiving your care.  IYou may want to seek more detailed evaluations from heart specialists, such as those who specialize in heart failure.  Someitmes more specialized testing can help reveal the problem.  If there is a heart problem, then one can run through a battery of imaging tests and also consider a heart biopsy.  have test for amyloidosis been done?  Was a bone marrow biopsy done?  Were biopsies for amyloidosis done?  One may also consider the help of an Infectious Disease expert.  My best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thalidomide and the proteosome inhibitor (Velcade or bortezomib) are very interesting drugs.  Chemotherapy has remained standard therapies for myeloma, but not every patient responds and since a complete eradication of the disease without the use of a bone marrow or stem cell transplantation cannot be achieved, the myeloma at some time after treatment will grow again and become active.  Thalidomide each day is being used by itself or with high-doses of dexamethasone (40 mg) once a week.  I do use low doses of thalidomide (200 mg at bedtime each day) with dexamethasone in relapsed myeloma for patients who are not going for a transplantation.  Since most myeloma patients are elderly, transplantation is not an option.  Thalidomide can work well for extended periods of time.  It can cause constipation, sedation, and peripheral sensory neuropathy.  But at low doses at bedtime, these side effects are not severe and can be managed.  The high dose of the dexamethasone can cause GI side effects and there appears to be an increased incidence of venous thromboses when it is added to the thalidomide.  There is still some debate about this.  I do not routinely anticoagulate my patients with warfarin (some people recommend it), but I do watch closely for blood clots.  I do have my patients take a full strength aspirin.  Bortezomib  does have interesting activity in the thrid-line treatment setting of myeloma.  It is easy to give and is tolerated well.  There are many exciting studies looking at using thalidomide either with standard chemotherapy or dexamethasone as first-line treatment of myeloma.  Bortezomib is also being actively studied early in the course of the disease.  Overall, thalidomide and bortezomib have improved our ability to treat patients with multiple myeloma and it will be most exciting to see what develops with clinical research studies using these drugs.

Other factors such as the degree of the bone marrow involved by the disease, the height of the abnormal protein made by themyeloma, the statusof the kidneys, the presence of elevated calcium levels in the blood, and a patient's overall medical condition and age factor into what forms of treatment can be considered and used.  various chromosomal abnormailites in various hematological diseases can provide information about the disease and sometimes prognostic information.

    "title": "Gene mutation",
    "content": "Lynn,  Sorry to hear about your sister.  The gene mutation 20210 that you refer in the setiing of blood clots is the prothrombin G20210A mutation.  This gene mutation is seen in some patients who develop abnormal blood clots.  It is one of the more common gene mutations seen overall in patients who develop unexplained or abnormal blood clots.  The gene mutation can occur as having a \"bad\" copy of both genes (normally there are two \"good\" copies of the gene), which is termed homozygous.  Heterozygous refers to having one \"bad\" and one \"good\" copy of the gene.  The homozygous state carries a higher risk of developing clots than does the heterzygous state.  Usually, the risk is lowinf a person developing a clot if just the 20201 gene mutation is present.  In fact, the majority of such people are termed \"silent carriers\" in that they do not develop clots.  Some people never know that they have the gene mutation .  It is not routinely tested for.  Usually a person with the 20210 gene mutation develops a clot if another event or process occurs that also carries a risk of developing a clot.  For example, a person with the 20210 gene mutation may not develop a clot, but if a surgery or tramua occurs or a cancer occurs, then there is more than one process now at play to generate a clot and the risk profile increases.  As far as I know, there is no association between the prothrombin gene G20210A mutation and multiple myeloma.  Unfortunatley, both are not uncommon and can occur in the same person.  Myeloma can have associated with it an increased risk of clots, but this is not due to the prothrombin gene.  Some forms of myleoma treatment (for example, thalidomide with or without dexamethasone) can be associated with blood clots independent of the 20210 gene mutation.  If someone has the 20210 gene mutation, then it does not go away.  There is nothing per se that can be done to keep the \"good\" copy of the gene doing well.  The best that can be done is to provide prophylactic blood thinning only if an event is to occur (such as immobility after surgery) that will increase the overall risk of clotting.  I would assume that if you and your children have been tested for this gene mutation, that you have undergone genetic counseling.   If not, then you should talk with a Hematologist (a blood specialist) or a Genetic Counseolr.  Jeffrey A. Gordon, M.D. Hematology-Oncology\n\n",

    "content": "The use of Bisphosphonate in Multiple Myeloma has added a new dimension in the treatment of Multiple Myeloma(MM) indeed. But due to the high cost of Bisphosphonates (I.E.-Zometa,Bondronath etc ) it often becomes impossible on the part of the patient to bear the cost.                          Some haemato-Oncologists consider it as an Ornamentation in MM. Now, I would like to know exactly how much helpful will the Bisphosphonate really be to a patient of MM ?\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Sohel,  Welcome!  Yes, unfortunatley, bisphosphonate therapy is expensive if someone does not have medical insurance, especially since the standard bisphophonates used in the treatment of multiple myeloma (at least in the U.S.) are given once a month on an indefinite time course.  The two FDA-approved bisphophonates that are used in the U.S. in this case are pamidronate and zoledronic acid.  The former has been used for a long time and is now in a less expensive generic form.  The latter is more potent, but in clinical trials comparing zoledronic acid 4 mg versus pamidronate 90 mg, both were equivalent.  It is not certain if the bisphophonate actually treats the myeloma, although there are intirguing laboratory findings and some clinical observations.  Nevertheless, it does significantly decrease the risk of hypercalcemia, bone fractures, and the debilitating complications of bone problems from myeloma.  I offer pamidronate 90mg once a month to my myeloma patients.  I consider it an important adjunct to  myeloma treatment, but the major part of myeloma treatment is the chemotherapy and/or steroids used.  I hope that this answers your questions.  Thanks for posting a question here at The Doctor's Lounge.\n\n",

I understand that Chemotherapy and/or steroids still remain the hallmarks of treating MM but to what extent do the Bisphosphonates work is still not clear to me. As here in Bangladesh many patients have to sell thier home/lands/business to meet the treatment of MM and in such cases can we not consider giving them Calcium supliments and other symptomatic treatments for the bone case insted of Bisphosphonates. Would it really offer a different in treatment?      I really feel for such patients and hope could provide an altarnative therapy which would be within thier limits.     Thank you for your considarations and best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Sohel,  Here in the U.S., we face as imilar problem with our patients who can not afford various treatments of the diseases.  In such cases, I have an honest talk with patients about their care and the cost of it.  There is a limit to how much free care we can provide.  If a patient wishes to hold on some part of treatment due to financial reasons, then that is their decision to make in an informed manne.   In the case of multiple myeloms, the important part of  treatment is 1.) chemotherapy, usually melphalan and prednisone or just dexamethasone therapy alone and 2.) control of any pain from the bones.  Bisphosphonates can help strengthen bones affected by myeloma, decrease the risk of developing bone fractures, and help with bone pain.  However, it does not replace chemotherapy or steroid therapy.  In the case of a patient who cannot afford treatment and wishes not to receive a bisphosphonate, then I proceed with just chemotherapy and/or steroid therapy, along with pain medications.  If the myeloma can be treated and kept under control for as long as possible, then the bone problems do improve, even without bisphosphonates.  Thank you for posting a question here at The Doctor's Lounge.  You are welcome to post a question any time and hopefully myself or someone else will be able to help you.
