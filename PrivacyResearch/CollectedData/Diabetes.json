    "content": "Hi my names Jose, I have a younger brother with type 1 diabetes. Last night I had a strange dream where half of my pancreas was taken out and replaced with half of his. His half that use to not produce insulin started too. I'm the dream the doctor explained it to be like jump starting a pancreas. So after his was working in me we exchanged halves again and now he had a working pancreas. I thought I should share this dream just incase something like this had never been thought of before. So my question is has it?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Josejl1984,  We are not currently doing partial pancreas transplants to my knowledge.  It would be unlikely that the partially transplanted pancreas would be able to \"jump start\" the other pancreas again since in Type 1 Diabetes, the insulin producing cells (islet cells) are actually destroyed by antibodies.    However, we are now doing islet cell transplants for some people and these new islet cells are able to make insulin.  This technology is still relatively new (islet cell transplants have been done for many years but it is still not standard treatment for diabetes) so don't look for every diabetic to get a transplant just yet.  There is some very interesting research going on in diabetes and it is quite plausible that we will be able to cure this disease and get patients off insulin at some point in the, hopefully, near future.  Best wishes.  Great ideas.  We'll see if this becomes reality someday.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Camieleb,  An excessive amount of any type of insulin can cause low blood sugars and can be dangerous.  Your grandmother's doctor needs to be involved to ensure that things are correct.  Please note that sometimes when patients are hospitalized their insulin needs change and the type may be changed as well to facilitate better control or more adjustable control to adapt to the medical situation going on.  I cannot provide much more information than that based on the information provided, nor would it be appropriate for me to do so since the limitations of the internet would preclude me from being able to truly give you accurate answers.  If you are concerned keep asking questions of her doctors and nurses to get the answers you need.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Is there a creatine safe that i can take with diabetes? even if i have to reduce the recommended dose as being this small is getting me down and just want life to be like it was 12 months ago.

    "content": "Hi. I have suspected myself of being prediabetic or diabetic for a while, so the other day I took a blood sugar test. However, I feel the test may have been affected by the previous day's alcohol consumption.  I had about 5 drinks and stopped around 6:00PM. I started fasting and then the next day I took my test at 9:00AM.  I got a result of 95 (which is acceptable) but I am wondering if the previous day's alcohol consumption (which is supposed to lower blood sugar) may have affected the score (which is already close to the pre-diabetes range).

    "content": "Hi,Initial reports in 1970s indicated that smoking marijuana resulted in lowering of  intraocular pressure (IOP) few hours after administration. These National Eye Institute (NEI)-sponsored studies demonstrated that some derivatives of marijuana did result in lowering of IOP when administered orally, intravenously, or by smoking, but not by topical application to the eye. The pressure-lowering effect is reported to last for about 3 to 4 hours. This fall in IOP was accompanied by a fall in blood pressure as well. There is apprehension in some quarters that the fall in blood pressure associated with falls in IOP may cause optic nerve ischemia.  Because the duration of the induced fall in IOP is short, it is estimated that an individual would have to smoke a marijuana cigarette eight or ten times a day in order to control IOP over 24 hours.

On the day i was diagnosed, it was the same time i took a paracetamol overdose. I took 94 tablets (A mixture of Panadol Extra, Panadol Sinus, Fludrex, Panadrex, Muscadol) and began vomiting like hell and thought these were the side affects of the overdose. I was rushed to the hospital hours later, and they began carrying out blood and urine tests. I was still vomiting and was short of breath they gave me an oxygen mask. I didn't tell them about the overdose of course.   When the doctor said it was diabetes, and didn't mention anything about an overdose or anything about taking any meds, I was confused. I stayed 5 nights at the hospital because they wanted to adjust my blood sugar level and was discharged today. Does it make sense that my overdose didn't have any affect on me? and wouldn't it show in the tests they carried out? It would be greatly appreciated if somebody please explains to me what's going on.\n\n",

For a person who is morbidly obese, weight loss surgery has often resulted in the diabetes (type 2) going away.  In type 1 the pancreas is not producing insulin but in type 2 the body isn't able to regulate and use the insulin it makes properly.  This is why type 2 may be reversed while type 1 cannot.  Exercise and diet can result in weight loss and thereby the same kind of reversal.  I don't know anything about the book, but if it is about weight loss in obese patients, I do understand this to be correct.  Beyond that I can't say what kind of diet and exercise might do this.  The cases I know of all needed to lose weight and they were cured when they did so.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Help with interpreting results of my glucose tolerance test",
    "content": "Hi there  I've been feeling increasingly odd of late. I went to my docs and had some checks done, including celiac which came back negative. The other blood work that was done was liver function test for which it came back with an elevated level of ALT (70), been like that for about 10 years though.  So I decided to self administer myself a GTT after reading a book about hypoglycemia, certainly a lot of the symptoms I was experiencing seems to point to hypoglycemia.  I would appreciate a professionals opinion on my GTT testing, even if its just an opinion. After doing a couple of GTTs, I'm not so sure it is indicative of hypoglycemia, but more prediabetic?  Test 1 (12/aug/2010)  Time | glucose (mmol/L) | comment 9.49am  | 6.1                     | fasting glucose level +30mins | 8.4                     | first reading after consuming 75g of glucose +1 hour | 9.0                      |had a drink of water at this point +1 hour 30 mins | 7.1 | slight physical activity (10 min drive) +2 hours | 7.8                                         +2 hours 30 mins | 5.9  I found this first set of results a little troubling, e.g. a fasting glucose level of 6.1. The previous night to the test at 8.42pm I drank a fruit smoothie (450ml) which contained 16.6g of carbohydrate of which 12.1g of naturally occurring sugars. Note 13 hours 7 minutes elapsed between that drink and first glucose reading at 9.49am the following day. I wondered whether having this drink may explain an elevated glucose level?  I decided to repeat the test the following day, here are the results, which look slightly better:  Test 2 (13/aug/2010)  Time | glucose (mmol/L) | comment 9.09am | 5.0 | fasting glucose level +30 mins | 9.9 | first reading after drinking 75g glucose only drink +1 hour | 9.9 +1 hour 30 mins | 7.4 +2 hours | 5.8 +2 hours 30 mins | 6.4  I thought these results looked better than the first set, however, I am slightly confused over why at 2 hours it went right down to 5.8 then 30 minutes later it was up again to 6.4. Perhaps it was just an inaccurate reading. All I was drinking was water, the previous night I last ate an evening meal at 6.30pm and also spent 10 minutes on an exercise bike (max heart rate 144 bpm).   After the end of test 2, I went and did a few jobs and when I returned home, I decided to take another sample at 12.29pm (which is 50 minutes since the last reading on test 2 of 6.4 mmol/L), the glucose level at 12.29pm was 4.4.  I am using a digital glucose by accu-chek and took my blood samples from my fingers on both hands.  These results don't seem to indicate a hypoglycemic condition. Because I seem to feel unwell after eating (sometimes), such as disorientation, light headed, mood change, detachment from surroundings, I am wondering whether a rapid rise in blood sugar levels could cause these kinds of symptoms?  I appreciate that these symptoms may also be the result of an allergy (I know its not gluten so far).  I don't smoke. I havent drank alcohol for about 6 weeks (trying to get to the bottom of why I feel unwell). Fairly healthy diet, drink lots of water, green tea and one cup of coffee per day. Take a good multivitamin and omega3. Last week started exercising every other day for 30 minutes a time at 75% max heart rate (144bpm for me). Im just under 30 years, weigh 170 pounds (5 foot 10inch tall), I always seem to put weight on in abdomen (so called potbelly) and even with exercise it is proving difficult to get rid of.  Any opinions, insights and advice would be much appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, The 2 hour and 3 hour OGGTs are generally recommended due to the following reasons. - in some normal individuals, the rapid emptying of the stomach contents(glucose) into the duodenum tends to cause a sudden large glucose level spike initially, before settling down by about 2 hours due to insulin action. - in others with slow gastric emptying, the initially the spike is low and the entire OGGT curve may remain rather 'flat'. Homeostatic mechanism are not instantaneous.It takes a while for the initial spike to be brought down by the insulin action. This is why the 2 hour value is considered as most crucial.  The 2 and 3 hour OGGTs have been subject to considerable disagreement as to their interpretation.  Your first OGGT values may be interpreted as impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Generally,if results indicate a IFG, an annual fasting blood glucose determination is recommended. The second test (done the very next day) shows normal values.  However, since you are concerned about being overweight, you should have your fasting blood glucose checked annually.  It takes sometimes years to accumulate fat, therefore it is not surprising that it will take a while to get rid of the excess as well. You need to persist with the dietary measures and exercises in order to be successful. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: I failed my one hr glucose test and took the 3 hr today!",
    "content": "Hi, To interpret the OGGT values provided and to offer any recommendations, one needs to know exactly which type of test was carried out(a 50 gm or a 100 gm OGTT) and also, at how many weeks of pregnancy the test was performed.  A 50 gm 1 hour OGGT is useful as a screening test generally performed at 24-28 wks of pregnancy.  The 2 hour and 3 hour OGGTs are generally recommended due to the following reasons. - in some normal individuals, the rapid emptying of the stomach contents(glucose) into the duodenum tends to cause a sudden large glucose level spike initially, before settling down by about 2 hours due to insulin action. - in others with slow gastric emptying, the initially the spike is low and the entire OGGT curve may remain rather 'flat'. These are some of the reasons why a full 2 or 3 hour OGGT is recommended.  There is general consensus regarding the reliability of the  50 gm 1 hour OGGT as a screening test. But,the 2 and 3 hour tests have been subject to considerable disagreement as to their interpretation.  In non-pregnant women, a peak value of >200 mg/dl and a 2 hour value of >200 mg/dl are necessary for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM). The National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG) criteria for gestational DM (for a 100 gm 3 hour OGGT) are, - a 1 hour value of 190mg/dl (10.5 mmol) or more, - a 2 hour value of 165 mg/dl (9.2 mmol) or more, and - a 3 hour value of 145 mg/dl (80 mmol) or more.  To draw 'reliable' conclusions about the diabetic status, atleast 2 OGGT values must be \"diabetic\". If only a single value is abnormal in a 100 gm test, the test should be repeated after an interval of a month.  It has also been observed that nearly 25% of the initially \"normal\" or \"impaired\" OGGT results may change significantly for the worse with advancing pregnancy.  There is growing evidence and concern that even one abnormal value during pregnancy is sufficient enough to have a significant impact on the health of the growing fetus.  With these facts in mind, i suggest that you should  (in consultation with your doctor)have your OGTT repeated approximately a month from the previous test. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 22 year old female and I have been in a constant debate with my boyfriend of 6 months. I am a healthy eater, meaning I drink soda rarely, I love salads and prefer to eat things grilled instead of fried. My only weakness is that I have an extreme sweet tooth. Chocolate is my vice and I eat it at least once a day or I am not a pleasant person to deal with. I have admitted that it is an addiction but I do not think it is as bad as his.   He on the other hand eats fried chicken or fried seafood every other day for a \"quick something to eat\" and will go and get a hot sausage sandwich sometimes two to three times a week, if not more. I have been told that any type of animal organs are high in cholesterol so he should not be eating it as often as he does. He eats NO fruits, refuses to touch a salad, and will only eat vegetables if they are baked into a pizza. He also eats a lot of hot dog wieners, cooked in the microwave, which I am sure is not the healthiest.  So we are at wits end with each other because he has the nerve to tell me that I shouldn't eat so much sugar,and that I have to stop because it is killing me. When I bring up his fried food obsession, he tries to justify it saying he \"exercises\" which consist of running up and down his stairs, sometimes, and doing push ups and sit ups, about twice a week. It is not an everyday occasion. And in the end, we end up eating at some of the most unhealthiest places he can find, and splitting a fried seafood plate in attempts to save money.  I would love to know who has the worse problem, me and my sweet tooth, or him and his screaming arteries, so we can end the constant arguing about where and what we eat from now on.\n\n",

Your description suggests a relationship problem that could use some attention, vs. comparing potential diseases.  If money is an issue, perhaps you could seek counseling through a public mental health agency, which usually has a sliding-scale fee structure so that you would pay only what you can reasonably afford.  I strongly encourage you to consider it.  Both hyperglycemia and hypercholesterolemia have significant complications.  It is a little like comparing apples and oranges - there is a common denominator, but they are very different.  Your central issue is that each of you denies that your particular indulgence in an unhealthy lifestyle is as bad as the other person's.  And that brings us back to addressing the relationship issue: respecting each other's choices, working together for the betterment of both, mature and realistic discussions of issues, planning healthy food choices that allow some favorites of both, and financial planning.    Good luck to both of you,\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the response Ms. Lang. The money is not a problem with us but more of the fact that we care more about the other person instead of looking at our own situations. You are correct. I say we split the plates a lot of times because we are both young adults and we figure it is a way to save with the economy being so bad.   Neither of us have the diagnosis but we both have family history in it. Mine is both diabetes and high cholesterol and his family history is in high cholesterol as well, even going so far as to loosing a parent young due to a heart attack. So when he tells me that he \"exercises\" and drinks water to justify his eating, I still get frustrated because I know the number one thing would be not to eat as much of the food. I care about him and do not want to see him down the same path as his parent. I am sure he feels the same way about me knowing I have diabetes on both sides of my family.   And because of this I am also trying to better myself by not suggesting we hit up as many doughnut shops or pastry stores. I will work on my chocolate craving by doing something I read online and tricking my brain with other spices like cinnamon to think it is getting something sweet when it really isn't. Also by turning down the usual eating places, though it may cause arguments because its out of the ordinary, will give me at least a healthier option so even if he chooses not to have a salad, that is his decision. I can only focus on a healthier option, ignore the dessert section, and exercise with him to let him know that he is not alone and I am willing to help.   Thank you very much for your help. It was greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Vadoff,  Your laboratory results would not be a primary indicator of diabetes.  Symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination, excessive thirst, extreme hunger, unusual weight loss, increased fatigue, irritability, blurry vision, slow healing of cuts and sores, itchy skin, yeast infections, dry mouth, and leg pain.   It can easily be determined if diabetes is an issue by having a fasting blood sugar, which measures the level of glucose in your blood after you have fasted for 8 to 10 hours.  If the result is high, your doctor might want to do an A1C blood test, which measures the glycated hemoglobin in your blood stream.  Glucose molecules tend to stick (\"glycate\") to hemoglobin molecules in your blood; the test measures the average blood glucose level over the past few months.  Your doctor may also want you to have a glucose tolerance test, which is a series of blood draws after you drink a specific sweet liquid.  The test measures if your body's insulin is adequate for proper metabolism of glucose.  Your progesterone level is low normal.  The test would have to be repeated to see if this is a chronic issue or if it was incidental.  Progesterone is a precursor hormone to the body's synthesis of both estrogen and testosterone.  Your cortisol levels are low except for the noon sample.  A saliva cortisol level can be elevated if the person has applied a topical cortisone cream prior to the test (this is not true with the blood test for cortisol).  Did you apply a cream before taking the sample?  Your doctor would want to do further tests to see if the levels were still low, and would probably elect to do blood tests to confirm the saliva test results.  Low cortisol can result in muscle weakness, muscle and/or joint pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, low blood pressure, low blood sugar, mood changes, depression, irritability, sensitive skin, frequent urination, salt craving and sleep problems.    Your symptoms could suggest the presence of depression, but with the initial cortisol tests, they are most consistent with an adrenal function issue.  It'smuch too early to suggest that would be the diagnosis, though.  As noted above, your doctor would do further tests to make that determination.  Your next step is to see your doctor, and make a detailed note of your symptoms to take with you to the appointment.    Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Trauma to the pancreas is usually due to two types of injuries namely, - blunt abdominal trauma and - penetrating abdominal trauma.  Pancreatic injury following trauma is unusual, and there are few data regarding the long term outcomes. Actual incidence of trauma-induced endocrine and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction is largely unknown.Of the few cases reported, most had occurred months or years following the trauma.  In trauma patients, whose pancreas is removed to varying extents, exocrine or endocrine insufficiency has been noted to be rare and usually occurs only in patients when >80-90% of the pancreas is removed. In low-grade pancreatic injuries treated nonoperatively, the remaining pancreatic tissue usually can regain its normal physiology regardless of trauma-induced parenchymal damage.The pancreas seems to have a good functional reserve.   It is possible that exocrine or endocrine deficiencies may be expected to occur if the injured pancreas is already diseased(ex;chronic pancreatitis). Smaller resections in these cases may have the potential to cause these deficiencies.Relative pancreatic insufficiency may also occur and should be considered if symptoms of altered glucose hemostasis or malabsorption manifest following the injury.   Development of diabetes mellitus(DM) has been reported in the literature following blunt trauma induced acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Post -traumatic interstitial fibrosis of the pancreas leading to strangling of the trapped islet tissue has been postulated as the causative factor.Milder forms of post-traumatic pancreatitis have not been reported to cause DM.  I could find only one case report in the Can Med Assoc J of 1952 August; of a trauma patient who presumably developed diabetes acutely following abdominal trauma.  Can Med Assoc J. 1952 August; 67(2): 143\u2013144.   Some reports of DM in patients undergoing 'necrosectomies' for necrotizing pancreatitis have been reported(although not in the context of trauma).   The high glucose levels seen in your friend's case should be interpreted with caution.There are many variables in ICU patients that can affect the blood glucose levels.  I hope this information is of help to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Confused on Blood Glucose Results.",
    "content": "Hi, Your confusion is not in any way unique, as you will appreciate as we go along.  The confusion stems from three main aspects. a) the various definitions in this context and the recommended 'normal' values/ranges, - the techniques of blood glucose analysis(plasma glucose vs whole blood glucose vs capillary glucose), and - difficulties in conversions between mmol/L and mg/dl.  (1 mmol/l = 18 mg/dl).  American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines are generally followed.There are guidelines as well (ex; European, Australian).   At the outset, one should remember that there are different sets of diagnostic criteria for  - clinical and  - for epidemiological settings.  In epidemiological settings, for studies involving high-prevalence populations or selective screening of high-risk individuals, a single measurement - the glucose level 2 h following  a glucose load (post-glucose load)- will be enough to describe presence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).  For epidemiological purposes the American criteria(1997) recommend the use of fasting plasma glucose concentration >= 7.0 mmol/l, in contrast with the current World Health Organisation criteria of 2 hour glucose concentration >= 11.1 mmol/l for diagnosis of diabetes. The application of the American criteria on European populations induced changes in prevalence of diabetes ranging from a prevailing reduction of 4.0%, to an increase of 13.2%!. Thus, the changeover to fasting plasma glucose will inevitably cause an increase in the prevalence of diabetes in some European populations.     In clinical practice however, diagnostic criteria include   = two separate fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values >126 mg/dL, - a random glucose 200 mg/dL,or    - two separate 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose values 200 mg/dL.  The use of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for the diagnosis of DM is not recommended at this time.Furthermore, stress induced evere hyperglycaemia should not be regarded as diagnostic of diabetes.It is better to review after stabilization of the primary condition.  Two factors significantly affect glucose measurements: - the hematocrit and  - delays after blood drawing.  The disparity between venous and whole blood levels amplifies when the hematocrit is high(newborns,or polycythemia). The specimen should be drawn into a fluoride tube or processed immediately to separate the serum or plasma from the cells. Delays will result in the measurable glucose being gradually lowered by continuing in vitro metabolism of the glucose at a rate of approximately 7 mg/dL/hr. This aggravates in the presence of leukocytosis.  Whole blood glucose levels (ex;by glucometers) are about 10%-15% lower than venous plasma levels.For more on this please visit the following link. http://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/vie ... glucometer  I hope this information is helpful and does not compound your pre-existing confusion! You need to consult your regular doctor who will be in a better position to correlate your clinical picture with your blood sugar values. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is it safe to lay down if your blood glucose level is 30?",
    "content": "Hi, You have not indicated which particular method was used in testing your blood sugar.I assume it was using a glucometer.  As per ISO 15197 standards, glucometers must provide results that are within 20% of a laboratory standard 95% of the time for concentrations about 75 mg/dL. For lower levels of blood sugar, they should approximate the 'absolute'(100%) laboratory standard levels.  It is extremely important that at blood sugar values around the lower limit of the laboratory normal range,the glucometer should deliver accurate values. This is crucial in type 1 diabetics taking insulin. Unfortunately, all glucometers may not be accurate enough at the lower blood sugar levels.  Some of the factors affecting the accuracy of glucometers: - calibration of the meter, - dirt on the instrument,  - ambient temperature(sampling capillary blood from a finger  or a heel that is too cold, can give a falsely-low blood sugar readings), -  humidity levels, - size and quality of blood sample,  - pressure use to wipe off the test strip(if applicable),  - high blood levels of certain substances (ex; ascorbic acid),  - hematocrit of thesample, - shelf life of the strips, - slight delays in transferring the blood sample to the meter (blood that has begun to clot may yield very low readings) etc.  Therefore, i suggest that you should have your blood sugar values checked in a laboratory and look for a correlation with your symptoms. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mumtofive,  Skin problems in children can be quite irritating for them.  I have a few thoughts that may help.  1st, is she using a topical steroid cream or ointment for the inflamed areas.  When eczema gets this bad, moisturizers alone are unlikely to control it.  (In rare instances, an oral steroid is needed initially to bring it under control.)    2nd, are we sure it is eczema?  Psoriasis can sometimes look a lot like eczema.  With all the atopic issues, it probably is eczema but it is important to get the right diagnosis to get the right treatment.  Also, with all the food allergies, food allergies themselves can spur on pretty severe eczema.  The key to food allergies at her age is complete avoidance of the offending foods to maximize the chances of \"growing out of the allergy\".  Avoiding allergic triggers (the foods, etc.) can dramatically improve skin eczema.  If possible, I would recommend your daughter be seen by a pediatric dermatologist and a pediatric allergist.  The allergist is important in getting this under control.  Sometimes the food allergy issue is forgotten about with eczema.  One other thought is that sometimes severe eczema can become superinfected with bacteria that will prevent it from getting better.  An antibiotic is needed in these cases.  Best wishes.  I hope this helps some.\n\n",

    "title": "Diabetic Hair loss",
    "content": "Hello, its my first time posting here, so please bare with me.  I have had Type 1 Diabetes for about 7 years now. I have never really been in perfect control, and since I've had the Insulin Pump, i've been a lot worse about it. And I think I'm starting to see some very bad side effects. Like almost fainting with lows, getting extremely agitated and furious when high, and I've started to see my hair leave me at a significant speed.   I'm only 20 years old, and my hair is of course a big deal right now. I would like to keep it, as being a 20 year old diabetic bald guy would do wonders for my self esteem. But I was wondering if Diabetes could cause my balding and thinning of my hair. I've read various medical posts on the internet on the subject, and they all seem to say the same thing, as if they are all from the same medical journal entry: basically that hair loss can be associated with Diabetes, but nothing about it being fixed. What I have come to understand is that Diabetes puts the body under a lot of stress, and stress as we all know causes hair loss. My skin is also very very dry and unhealthy. Not so much that others can see, but I can see i when I look at it. My entire body is spotted with pimples as well. I was wondering if all of these have to do with Diabetes stress, and if I get in control of my sugars, if the hair loss could possibly reverse itself... or if the roots in my scalp are permanently damaged.   To sum it up, is there anyway to reverse Diabetic hairloss, and do you think this has to do with my diabetes with the information I gave you?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter has been diagnosed with severe hypoglycemia. We are waiting for an opening with the endocrinology dept for further tests.  She has a meter, and tests her blood glucose 4 times a day.  She is very small and is losing weight (now under 100 pounds) she is 16.  She does have episodes of her blood sugar spiking up to 250 to 300 but not very often, usually it is in the 40 or 50's.  Her pediatrician has run thyroid tests, all normal. Liver and kidney function tests, and cbc. All normal.  But I am concerned that she continues to get swollen glands, both in her neck, and in her arm pits.  She was tested for mono, but that came back negative.  Is swollen glands a sign of diabetes?  Could it be causing the low blood sugar?  Thank you for any help or advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, From your description of your daughter's symptoms and signs,i wonder if she needs a lymph node biopsy or an FNAC(fine needle aspiration cytology) of one of the enlarged lymph nodes.Some malignancies including lymphomas are known to present with hypoglycemia.   You say, \"She does have episodes of her blood sugar spiking up to 250 to 300\".With this in mind, if the lymph nodes were not enlarged,one may have suspected a 'reactive hypoglycemia\"(post-prandial hypoglycemia), which occurs following a high carbohydrate meal and is due to release of excessive insulin by the pancreas, 2-4 hours following such a meal.  I suggest that she needs to be investigated fully to exclude some of the conditions i have mentioned as well as others. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hey, this is my first post on doctorslounge.   I'd be really grateful if someone could give me advice, firstly I haven't been diagnosed with diabetes and as far as I know don't have many symptoms.  On Saturday night I went out with a few friends, and wore shoes for the first time in about a year, the journey to my friends house (which is a 15-20minute walk) caused my ankles to really hurt. Two identical sores appeared, which were red and the skin appeared to be a little bit broken.  I got 2 plasters from my friend and put them on, thinking they were blisters - and I preceeded to go out. The morning after, I noticed that the sores had gotten worse - there seems to be a slight yellow tinge to them.  It's now Wednesday and they don't seem to have changed much in appearance since then - they are quite stingy/painful when touched - or when I wear comfortable trainers and walk they hurt quite a bit but still bearable.  What is the usual time for an ulcer to heal and do people think this is worth a visit to the doctors? I don't usually go for anything and would feel a bit silly going along and being told i had some slight sores on my feet from wearing shoes that I wasn't used to. Searching the net has scared me a little bit, as I've never been tested for diabetes and am probably slightly overweight and don't have the most healthy of diets (I was just under 13st when I last checked 6months or so ago, and haven't really changed weight since then and I'm a 6\"3 20 year old male).  Any other information I'd be happy to provide, I await your replies - thanks in advance.  They leave marks on socks when I wear them, which could be blood, infection or moisture - I'm not sure.  I have taken some pictures of them and hosted on image shack, i'd be very grateful if you could take a look.   http://img17.imageshack.us/g/img1560b.jpg/\n\n",

    "title": "Re: weakness and sugar level drop",
    "content": "Hi You have been diagnosed with a condition called PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome), and it is usually associated with hormone imbalances, especially relatively increased insulin and male hormones. This increased amount of insulin is due to an 'insulin resistance' in people with PCOS, and the increased male hormones cause excessive hair. Regarding your dizziness after meals, a simple fasting and random level may not be the answer, and your doctor may want to perform a test called an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), in which a measured amount of glucose is given to the person, and blood sugar levels tested at intervals sometimes up to 4 hours. You might be getting low glucose levels after the 2-hour period. You should discuss this with your endocrinologist. Meanwhile, you need to take a diet with low fat content, low glucose index and avoid heavy meals. This will help you avoid any positive spikes on an already increased insulin level. Mild to moderate exercise will help you reduce weight. As far as you being insulin resistant, there is considerable data in medical journals that people with PCOS are in fact resistant to insulin. But how much resistant can be difficult to answer. This is because different people respond to a given amount of insulin differently, and to prove that someone is 'technically' insulin resistant requires another test called HOMA-IR. Please let us know of your LH, FSH and cortisol levels & any medicines you may have started. (if DHEA/testosterone was done, let us know of that as well). Thank you for your thought provoking question.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Welcome to the forums. I am not very well aware of alcohols, having read your question I have searched the internet and wikipedia. All alcoholic drinks are classified according to a term called 'alcohol by volume' (ABV).  Cider. beer, wine etc have an ABV content from 2-18%, while vodka, rum, gin, whiskey etc have a value of 30-60%. I'd say that Bud Light is the lesser of two evils(4.2%), rather than you having Captain Morgan Spiced Rum undiluted.  I hope that helped.\n\n",

    "content": "For a Neurologist.  My mom has been a type 1 severe hypoglycemic diabetic for 37 years. She has had vast problems like uncontrollable sugar, lots of grand mal seizures (always bounced back to base line within 24 hrs) dementia, dementia vs. pseudo dementia, possible strokes, brain shrinkage due to age (69) and possible use of dilatain, massive depression, many broken bones so you get the picture etc\u2026 well she was at a nursing /rehab facility for a short visit to get physical rehab and to work on medication skills/life skills so she could go to an assisted living apt or live with a family member. She had lived with me in the last year was able to give herself all her own meds, shots etc\u2026 I could work full time and she would go swimming everyday. Well at this rehab place, we found out (after the ST of CA did and investigation and found out what happened, have those papers to fax at your request) that they gave her insulin before checking her blood sugar. They later found her having a grand mal seizure (we will never know for how long) and when they took her bs it was \u201cLO\u201d un readable. They started to give her glucose and the ambulance got there 9 minutes later and took her bs and it still said \u201cLO\u201d. In my moms entire history of low bs she had never bottomed out, the lowest she ever went was a \u201c12\u201d. So we have no idea how long she suffered hypoxia and how long her brain staved for food (BS). Ever since then she has never walked ring even though she had a lot of gait and balance probs before, she has never walked without a walker with assistance. Before she walked on her own sometimes with a walker. Her memory, short tem is pretty much gone and her talking skills and cognitive skills have gotten worse. Now with all those problems she had be fore that one prolonged seizure is it possible that one prolonged seizure could have done even more damage? She has never bounced back to her baseline since that prolonged sever hypoglycemic seizure. I have records for anyone who wants to see them. You may email me at rashauna@hotmail.com\n\n",

Dividing 1000 or 1200 by 4 gives 250-300 grams of carbohydrates per day.  There may be specific issues for your husband that may adjust this number up or down some.

She said her diabetes was stress induced ( she said her doctor said thats what caused it). She is currently taking pills to try and control it. My concern is that the pills are not doing the job. I think she needs insulin. She's constantly tired and taking a lot of energy tablets to try and get thru the workday. She is constantly having to urinate. She is constantly thirsty. On several occasions she has almost passed out on me, her eyes will dialate and glass over and she will get a confused animal look on her face. I can also tell when her sugars are out of whack,(often) because she changes into a different person. She has also lost a tremendous amount of weight, She was not heavy to begin with and had a very athletic body. She has black circles under her eyes lately and looks horrible because she is so thin. I really want to get the healthy girl back that I met a year and a half ago. What would your recomendation be???\n\n",

Weight reduction helps decreasing peripheral insulin resistance. You can use weight loss pills along with diabetes medication. ACOMPLIA has shown very good results in many people but it needs to be taken only after the consultation of your doctor. The pill is better to be avoided if one is suffering from depression.  Diet planning remains the mainstay of reducing weight along with supplementary pills and exercise.\n\n",

    "content": "I just wanted to share the following information regading Acomplia  The NDA was accepted for review by the FDA in June 2005; in phase III development in Europe. In February 2006 the manufacturer reported that the FDA issued an approvable letter for weight management but a non-approvable letter for smoking cessation. In April 2006 and November 2006, rimonabant was approved for use as an adjunct to diet and exercise in promoting weight loss in obese patients or overweight patients with risk factors such as diabetes mellitus type 2 or dyslipidemia in Europe and Mexico, respectively. The drug also received approval as an adjuvant treatment to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes when used in combination with conventional therapies in Mexico.   In June 2007, the FDA Endocrinologic and Metabolic Advisory Committee voted unanimously against the approval of rimonabant for the treatment of weight loss; the committee indicated that certain side effects, primarily psychiatric disturbances including depression, anxiety, changes in sleep patterns, and suicidal ideation, are increased in patients taking rimonabant compared to placebo.   The FDA, which typically follows the recommendation of advisory committees, was expected to make a final decision by July 27, 2007; however, Sanofi-Aventis withdrew the NDA application on June 29, 2007. Sanofi-Aventis plans to resubmit the application at a later date.  So overall, the drug is not yet approved in USA.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: can hypoglycemia turn into diabetes?",
    "content": "Hi Alicia,  This is an excellent question and I'm glad you brought it here. While hypoglycemia will not \"turn into\" diabetes, it is sometimes considered a possible pre-diabetic metabolic lesion or, to put it in layman's terms, sometimes people with a tendency toward type II diabetes will sometimes be hypoglygemic early on only to much later develop type II diabetes. There is no guarantee this will happen, and one doesn't really \"turn into\" the other, but the balance shifts from too much insulin to too little later in life, usually in the 5th or 6th decade, or earlier if obesity is a problem. Since you have a family history of type II diabetes you already carry a risk factor for that, so whether you're hypoglycemic now or not, there is a greater chance, especially with development of overweight or frank obesity, that you'd develop diabetes later on anyway. The fact that you're hypoglygemic now could serve as a flag for that risk and maybe remind you to watch your weight, although right now you're probably not overweight at all. This is the pattern in families often, with low or normal weight and sometimes hypoglygemia, then later, with addition of excess weight, development of type II diabetes. So you now know the best way to avoid this happening is to maintain a healthy weight at all times, and avoid overweight or obesity, which will greatly reduce the likelihood of diabetes later on.  Hope this answers your question. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I have had Grave's Disease for 5 years, and had a radioactive iodine treatment done shortly after diagnosis.  My thyroid went from high to low for several years, and was aggravated by my first 2 pregnancies (my first child had neonatal thyrotoxicosis).  During my 3rd pregnancy I became officially hypothyroid.  Lately I have been having migraines, extreme mood swings, thirst, and dizziness.  I started checking my blood sugar levels, as my dad is a Type 1 and was diagnosed at my age.  Some days it stays low and in the normal range, but I can feel when it goes above 180 as I start to get a headache.  Last week I was feeling fatigued so I picked up an oreo McFlurry on my way home.  I finished about 1/3 of it before starting to feel nausiated, so I stopped eating.  At 20 minutes I started getting a splitting headache and my BS was 191, then at 45 minutes it was 276, at 1 hr 15 it was 161, and at 2 hr it was 80, at 2 hr 20 min it was 55.  My fasting glucose is anywhere from 70 to 131 - and it doesn't seem to be predictable, and it's never been clinically recorded high.  Yesterday I had an appointment with my general physician, who said I clinically am not diabetic.  6 weeks ago, my fasting was 99 and yesterday my 2 hr post-meal was 164.   The med student who saw me before the doctor said something to the extent of, \"we don't look at how high it goes, but how long it stays high.  If your fasting is above 126 twice or a random is recorded above 200 THEN you're diagnosed as diabetic.  In your self registered hyperglycemic event it went back to normal within 2 hours, so you wouldn't even fail a glucose tolerance test.  You're likely not diabetic.\" - is that true?  I feel fine some days, but like I'm going through a blood sugar rollarcoaster on other days, but that I had to push them to draw an A1C.  Could I have a lazy pancreas that still pumps insulin out but in lower amounts or normal amounts at unpredictable times?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Your question is an excellent one, and involves a relatively new class of diabetes which is somewhat controversial, as are a number of aspects of current diagnostic criteria for diabetes.   To get straight to the point, it seems likely you are going through a period of pre-diabetic hypoglycemia with glucose spikes too brief to currently qualify you as diabetic of any of the types. However, two things argue in favor of the likelihood of eventual type 1.5; first Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune issue, as are diabetes type I and I.5 (but not type II); and second, a family history of type I. Your medical student is correct, however, in quoting you the flat, statistical diagnostic criteria currently in use, which would not qualify you for any type of diabetes, even though something is clearly going on and is probably an autoimmune process, something that can attack various body systems.   For now, I would ride the ups and downs and just have yourself tested routinely as normal, but with HB A1C check at least twice yearly. You may never develop a clear-cut type, but most likely something will eventually surface. You are at precisely the average age of onset of type 1.5, so you may be going through a \"herald\" phase now. The good news is if you wind up as 1.5 your problem will be relatively easy to manage and for the most part this type doesn't carry with it the serious complications of the other types, such as kidney, nerve and heart damage. If you have to have a form of diabetes this isn't a bad one to have, and since you've pretty much missed the takeoff point for type I, this would likely be what you'd develop, if you develop anything. You haven't yet, at least according to what I personally feel are very arbitrary parameters for diagnosis, so again, regular checking clinically is your best bet. It can't hurt to check when things seem to be acting up,  as you've been doing, and it may even be worthwhile to keep a journal of your findings, but it won't earn you a diagnosis. It's just as well for now, too. Still,  will be worth keeping a record for future reference.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  While diabetes and ED do tend to go hand in hand, it is usually a combination seen in older men, and it doesn't occur over night. If your glucose is well managed and you have no other symptoms secondary to diabetes such as neuropathy or vascular problems, this is probably not the cause of your problem. You don't say how long you've suffered with ED or even if you do. I'm assuming you've experienced some difficulty with this or you likely wouldn't have asked, but I suppose its possible you're thinking ahead. At any rate, if you seem to be suffering from impotence now, while it would be unusual, it is not impossible that it's secondary to diabetes. It is often difficult to differentiate the causes of ED, but it is well known that even diabetics (usually in the late 30s to mid 80s age group) benefit greatly from sildenafil or, if inappropriate for a given patient, often yohimbine. So there are certainly medical solutions to the problem, but first you should determine if there is some other cause of this. Meanwhile, again, it is unlikely -- but not impossible -- that this is a complication of diabetes.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pitting edema from with cold feet treating with HZCT",
    "content": "Hi Corwin,  While lithium does seem the most likely suspect in rapid onset pitting edema, the  use of HCZT to counter the edema is extremely unwise, as lithium has a very narrow range of \"normal\" and acceptable levels, and overdosage can be extremely dangerous. Since diuretics reduce sodium levels and this in turn can increase effective blood levels of lithium, functional overdose is possible simply by taking something like HCZT. Also, anyone taking lithium needs to have access to regular testing of serum lithium levels, which is a direct test apart from the other routine ones you mentioned.   The cold sensation in your feet is difficult to determine at a distance, but since you also are a fairly recently diagnosed diabetic, this may have something to do with that. Hopefully you are monitoring your blood glucose levels at least daily. There are a number of medications on board and some combination could also be responsible for this problem. If your doctor can't determine the cause of the edema (even though lithium is a likely suspect) and especially since he prescribed HCTZ to be taken along with lithium, he needs to at the very least be closely monitoring your serum lithium levels and if not, then you may well need a consult with someone better versed in the use and management of these medications and the conditions for which they've been prescribed.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you  and please do follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  This is an excellent if difficult question. The whole definition of diabetes, based upon threshold glucose numbers, has changed a great deal over the past 15 years, the bar having been lowered several times. Also, there is a grey area, especially with patients who are diagnosed in their teens or 20s. Sometimes these remain relatively stable indefinitely. Right now your daughter is responding very well, but if the disease progresses as per usual, yes, the end of the \"honeymoon\" will be heralded by increased glucose numbers. This can be very gradual or it can be rather sudden, depending upon the ultimate form of the disease. If this turns out to be \"brittle\" diabetes the numbers could suddenly spike. If not, they could creep or even hover. The important thing is to continue, even in light of very good results to monitor.   I wish you and your daughter all the best. She's off to a good start, and the  \"honeymoon\" can  sometimes last. It's just good to be prepared for anything in terms of the next phase, if there is one. Sometimes there isn't. The doctor is being very prudent. I hope this is helpful to you and please do follow up with us here as needed, and keep us updated in any case.\n\n",

I assume she is in Honeymoon phase of Type 1 Diabetes during which time glycemic control is achieved with modest doses of insulin or rarely insulin may not be needed at all. Her doc has put her on minimal dose of insulin to give rest to her diminishing beta cells of pancreas. However, destruction of beta cells is an ongoing autoimmune process.   So when the honeymoon period is over (which is  subjective ranging from few weeks to months) beta cell function is lost and insulin is needed for rest of the life.  Yes, glucose levels might rise, but you need to monitor them frequently as per your doctor's advice. Many Type ones are admitted in emergency with a condition called ketosis or ketoacidosis in which there is a presence of ketones in urine.   So you must especially monitor her glucose levels when is not well/ill. That time, insulin requirement might go up.\n\n",

    "content": "Our daughter was hospitalized for a kidney infection and was on IV and Rocephin ea. 12 hrs. for 3 days. While hospitalized, she began showing elevated random glucose levels- in the range of 127-194 mg/dL. Her glycohemoglobin was 6.2%. Fasting glucose 127 mg/dL with insulin 8.54 m/UL. All other bloodwork was within normal range. An endo was called in and he ran a Fructosamine (results 248 umol/L) and also a GAD-65 Ab (results 0.07 nmol/L- reference range <= 0.02).   This endo diagnosed her with Type 1 Diabetes.   Subsequent tests, for t-Transglutaminase IgA (results=1 U/mL, reference 0-3 negative).And a glucose tolerance test that we think was messed up by the lab, as we witnessed discussion by several technicians reading the lab manual on the correct way to do the test. Later we were told by the technician that the 4th and last (draw) was not necessary. Her blood was drawn only 4 times- yet there were 5 results for the test.   Glucose (fasting) 110, 203,338,106,370. (This last number is in question). Insulin  (fasting) 5.8, 13.7, 14.3, 5.7, 12.2. (Also questioning this number).  C-peptide= 1.6 ng/ml  This is an otherwise healthy, active (5'7\", 136 lb.) teenager with no significant medical history and no family history of diabetes.   This doctor was not interested in repeating any of the tests. Our daughter is still monitoring her glucose levels which range fasting 110 to 150 2-hr. post meal. Obviously she has something going on and her body is not fully metabolizing glucose. We are under the care of a 2nd opinion endo- who just looked at the paperwork and agreed with the first doctor. Shouldn't we have 2 full independent sets of tests- especially since the first set were performed while she was in the hospital with over 104 fever and dehydrated from the kidney infection?\n\n",

There are two values in the glucose tolerance test, 203 and 338, which are not ok. Diabetologists all over the world follow the World Health Organization guidelines when diagnosing diabetes. Accordingly, a fasting glucose levels more than 126 mg/dl and a random blood glucose more than 200 mg/dl (or 2-hours after an oral glucose tolerance test) means the person is diabetic. Teenagers and children are growing, so doctors start them immediately on insulin as their health can be severely affected.  It is quite possible that your daughter got the kidney infection primarily because she had diabetes, as high glucose impairs body defenses and most bacteria love high glucose. I hope that helped, and cleared some reservations you had. Dr. N. Haider.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Aimee729, It is not surprising that the c-peptide levels of a lot of people with diabetes may fall in the normal range, especially early in the disease. For every unit of insulin produced in the body, a unit of c-peptide is also produced. Please note that currently c-peptide levels are used to assess body insulin production 'indirectly', and in the further division of diabetes into type I, type II or others. For diagnosis, glucose levels are used. It'd be useful to follow your daughter's c-peptide levels, a rising level will show improvement in body's own insulin production. A fall in the levels will mean she'll need more insulin as medicine. What you have shared with us so far, I agree with your endocrinologist. This honeymoon period can last from weeks to sometimes a couple of years. Please continue monitoring her glucose levels, as these numbers will start getting in higher range when that period is over. I know this has not been easy for you and your daughter. But we should be glad that she will be getting better now. Best wishes for you.  Dr. N. Haider\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your reply. Our daughter is under the regular care of an endocrinologist. She checks her glucose on the average of 5 times a day, per her doctors orders. We also regularly see a nutritionist and a diabetes educator. Overall her health is good. If this is the honeymoon it is certainly easy. Her diet is close to what it normally was before, only slightly healthier. She is taking 2 units of Levemir at bedtime.   My concern is making a clear diagnosis and getting her the best treatment for her futrue health.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello               I am pregnant in 31st week and have been diagnosed with diabetes about 2-3 weeks ago. I went for glucose test, my blood sugar was tested 45 min after, and my reading was 10.3 at that time. About one week ago I sow an endocrinology and metabolism specialist and he gives me a gloomier to check my blood levels, since then I am on diet and I am checking my blood sugar.   My readings are:   In the morning before breakfast -5.4, 5.3, 5.0, 5.0,  Morning 1 hour after eting-7.7, 6.5, 5.9, 7.6,  1 hour after lunch-7.3, 7.8, 6.8, 6.7,  1 hour after diner-7.2, 8.3, 6.3, 6.7.    Today I went to see him again and when he sow my results for the past week he said that I have to start taking insulin every night before I go to bed because  my morning blood levels are too high .  My question is can this be considered as diabetes and do I have to start taking insulin?  Can I please have the normal blood sugar levels during pregnancy.  Thanks Vesta\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 35-yr old Female diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes December 2006.  My first A1c was 9.1.  Having a grandmother who died from Diabetes complications at a young age, I was terrified.  I completely cut out all carbs from bread, pasta, potatoes, rice and kept carb intake from fruits and veggies under 50 grams per day.  I was generally eating fewer than 500 calories per day. I drank nothing except plain water or unsweetened tea. I tested my glucose about 8 times per day.  I had very rapid weight loss of nearly 50 pounds, and my glucose was much better controlled.  After two subsequent A1c tests, I got it down to 6.8.  After concern from my doctor about the rapid weight loss (although I still needed to lose more) I raised my carbs per day to 100 grams, and total calorie intake to right around 1000.  Nearly 2 years of very tight glucose control and I finally snapped.  I just couldn't do it anymore, so I pretty much quit the whole treatment.  I don't overeat - I never have, but I couldn't stand not being able to eat any bread, pasta, potatoes, or rice ever again. I never eat more than the recommended servings per day according to the ADA and don't eat anything with sugar. I haven't had an A1c test done until a few weeks ago at an employee health fair.  Needless to say, it's not pretty news.  My A1c is 10.3.  I've started taking my Metformin again and testing twice per day, but my blood glucose won't seem to go under 220.  I can't bear to go back to that strict diet of only fresh veggies and chicken or fish with an occasional 1/4 serving of fruit or dairy.  How can I get back on track when mentally, I can't motivate myself to go back to that horrible existence?  I hated when we had work lunches and I couldn't eat what everyone else was having...I could only have my raw veggies I brought from home.  Any suggestions?  Also - tell me truthfully, how bad is 10.3?\n\n",

Most of the studies suggest that breathalyzers are not accurate in the presence of significant ketosis because the exhaled acetone (one of the ketones produced in ketosis) can interfere with the test.  If there were concern, the best thing would be to test a blood alcohol level directly.  This will specifically measure ethanol and not acetone.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Your tests indicate that you have a form of diabetes that is common in adults, who have developed a resistance to the action of 'insulin', the glucose utilizing hormone. Such results would mean that the pancreas (the gland that pours insulin into blood) may get 'exhausted' in a couple of years, and you might need medication. It will be kind of you to provide us with your weight and height, so that we can calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index). This will help us in further discussing the case with my colleagues. I'll also advise you to exercise regularly and keep a check on your cholesterol levels.  Thanks, Dr. N. Haider\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with new onset uncontrolled type 1 diabetes on February 27, 2009 after a trip to the emergency room. I was released from the hospital after three days and put on glipizide twice daily. The doctor told me that the glipizide takes time to build up in my system so I waited. My blood sugar remained in the 400-500s. I was having very bad headaches, dizzy, weak, frequently going to the bathroom and very thirsty. I didn't think that the medicine was working so I went to a different doctor. She put me on all new medications including insulin. The original doctor put me off work due to my condition and was given my Family Medical Leave Act and Short Term Disability paperwork. After a month, I returned to see the original doctor. At that time, the paperwork was not completed and our jobs were on the line. Our company gave us an extension to have the paperwork turned in. The doctor was very upset that he had to do this and said that he couldn't promise anything. He finally filled out the paperwork, but because of his time delay, I did not recieve my short term disability check. I have no money, perscriptions at the pharmacy that I can't pay for, I'm short on food and gas, ect. I can't go see a new doctor because I don't have any money. The doctor that I saw changed my dose of insulin and said that he will see me again in a month. I know that this dose isn't working and I don't want to wait another month to get better. Are there free doctors that I can see, or can I be my own doctor and change my inculin dose according to what my blood tests are?\n\n",

Have you kept a daily log of your blood sugar levels? Have you notified your physician's office to inform them of what your levels are and that your blood sugar levels remain uncontrolled? If you have not already done so I would suggest this to be the first place to start. It does take some time to find the right combinations of medications to bring your blood sugar levels within normal limits. Have you started an exercise program, for example walking, because this will also lower glucose levels. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Effect of Supplements on Insulin",
    "content": "Hello --  While we get similar questions here from time to time, it's difficult to give a direct answer because the supplement (and others like it) are not clinically tested and medically approved. Further, there are potential side effects, sometimes long term and often delayed, which are highly unpredictable. For instance, while hypoglycemia my temporarily be produced, and while this can be at least offset by dietary changes, this would appear to risk upsetting the natural calibration of the pancreas so that future glucose metabolism problems may occur. Again, there isn't enough concrete evidence pro or con in this regard, but as medical professionals it would be highly unprofessional to advocate use of a supplement which deliberately disturbs the natural metabolic process,  especially when there is even a suspicion of potential problems.   Obviously purchase of the supplement is legal, so you can let your conscience be your guide. My personal feeling about this particular plan is that it would be running an unreasonably high risk of future problems that could be extremely serious, even though I have no studies to point to to back this up.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with whatever you choose. Follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I gave birth three months ago.  I had gestational diabetes during pregnancy.  At 9 weeks postpartum I had a 2-hr glucose tolerance test.  The results were: fasting 86, 1-hr 185 and 2-hr 225.  My midwife then refurred me to an endocrinologist.  I have since been testing my blood sugars again and they have all been within 85-120.  This is with eating McDonalds and sugary foods as well.  I am wondering how it would be possible to have diabetes and have perfectly normal blood sugar readings.  I even borrowed a friends meter, and his meter was within 3 points of my own, so I know it's accurate and calabrated also.  I had asked my midwife to let me take the 2-hr again, since I had some doubts about the results.  They refused...  First of all, I was having a very heavy period and I've read that this can effect blood sugar levels.  Also my meter has an option to mark a reading with \"menses\", so I know this to be true (even though my midwife and the nurse said otherwise).  Second, they forgot (and I didn't think about it until later) to tell me to bulk up on carbs for three days before the test, and I was dieting, so my carb intake was drastically lower than normal.  Third, I took the test at 2:30 pm after having had two cups of coffee with my breakfast at 6:30 am (8 hours of fasting, but not tested first thing in the morning).  Could the test be wrong?  If I were to have the test redone (which the endo says he would do) and it still shows high, even though my own results are normal, what does that mean?  Is it possible to have diabetes and still have totally normal readings all the time?  Should I take this as a sign that I have a precurser to diabetes and just keep eating healthy and dieting?  Should I bother to visit the endocrinologist?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  You need to have a second GTT as well as a hemoglobin A1C test, to determine if the findings are consistent. There was enough wrong with the circumstances of  the first test to make it probably invalid. Second, since you had gestational diabetes you're more likely to have metabolic abnormalities which may well  resolve over time. If your home tests are in the range you describe, then you either are coming down from the gestational form and may well stabilize at normal, or you may have what's often called \"prediabetes\",  which may or may not evolve into confirmable diabetes. By all means keep living a healthy lifestyle as you are now, especially since there is some slight question about your ability to metabolize sugars,  but it sounds like right now you really need a proper recheck and hemoglobin A1C test done. If they come out within normal limits you can pretty well stop worrying about this. If they show something else, you'll probably have to be followed (at least with occasional 8-12 hour fasting glucose tests) for a while. If that all comes out clear then, again, you'll be able to relax.   I'd see the ednocrinologist for sure. Get this out of the way one way or the other. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again -  There's a whole long list of possible causes of frequent urination and thirst (one follows the other), and while some  can be serious, most of the time it is a temporary metabolic imbalance. If this persists you may have to have a different sort of test, a 24-hour urine test, to determine if there's something funny going on with your adrenals. I say this because you are looking less and less like a diabetic, and no, the frequent drinking and urination wouldn't alter your blood sugar, at least not enough to keep you from registering in the diabetic range. In fact, your ER glucose reading totally defies diabetes as a cause of the other (new) symptoms. I still think you should have at least a hemoglobin A1C test, which would be able to tell if your blood sugar has  been elevated over the past few months. This is an excellent guide in diagnosing diabetes, and an essential occasional test for known diabetics, to be certain the condition is well-controlled. I strongly suspect you don't have diabetes, but it's not completely impossible, so this test would be very helpful in ruling it out once and for all. Then, if the thirst and urination continue, you can consider ruling out adrenal problems, which may also not be present (again, this can just happen sometimes, for a stretch, then return to normal).  Please keep us updated. We'll be right here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  It appears I did what you said, yet the response still is valid, as your question rather overlapped the content of the first poster's questions. I apologize for mistaking you for someone else (new questions are usually posted in separate threads so it's easy to not realize one is responding to a different poster). Again, though, I'd stand by the answer as totally appropriate to your question.  Further, regarding the 2-hour post-prandial glucose \"peak\", as with all things it is an average, not an ironclad rule. Our glucose levels change throughout the day depending upon a lot of different factors including activity (or lack of it), stress (or relief of stress), etc. A small increase in blood glucose beyond the 2-hour window is not abnormal, and  yours was certainly still within an acceptable range. There is a phenomenon known as post-prandial dip, wherein glucose levels actually drop after a generous meal, then slowly rebound. This could also explain  the difference, although it's really close enough to normal to not warrant any further investigation anyway.  Hope this is helpful and again I apologize for not realizing who I was addressing when I wrote the reply -- even though it turns out to be the right answer anyway. :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Panadol CF contains psuedoephedrine (along with chlorphenaramine, an antihistamine, and paracetamol, a mild analgesis). Psuedoephedrine (also known alone by the brand name Sudafed), can cause increases in blood glucose levels. If the diabtetic is \"brittle\", then it probably isn't a good idea to take it, but if blood glucose is well managed with the combination of Glucophage and Diamacron MR, then it probably would simply require that the patient monitor glucose levels as per usual and note if there is a significant and sustained increase in glucose levels during the period that Panadoll CF is being used. It doesn't pose a generally great risk, only the potential to raise the levels above what is considered desireable. It won't necessarily result in a diabetic crisis. Continuing to monitor the blood levels as per usual should tell the patient whether or not the psueodephedrine component of Panadaol CF is causing a problem. If so, then it should be discontinued.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Azoran is a very potent immunosuppressant generally reserved for certain life-threatening diseases. The remedy strikes me as overkill, since an \"overactive immune system\" sounds to me like it simply means you have an autoimmune disease, which it appears you do, and not a life-threatening one at all. If you have no other signifcant health issues this seems an extreme response to a fairly benign if sometimes cosmetically annoying problem. If you have diabetes this is just one more reasaon I'd think it not a good idea, although there are lots of other potential pitfalls as well. I think you'd do well to tell your doctor you'd like to withdraw Azoran and pursue other, simpler remedies for the problem.   I hope this is helpful to you.

    "content": "I am a 45 year old woman, diagnosed with diabetes in 2003.  Until 6-7 months ago, my diabetes was fairly well controlled by medication, ActoPlusMet, with a1C's typically in the 6.9 to 7.1 range.   However, I was not eating healthy, nor was I exercising.  I weighed 230 lbs.    In June 2008 I stopped taking my meds.  No good reason why -- I just don't like taking them.  Naturally, I stopped testing my blood sugar and I canceled a doctor's appointment and \"forgot\" to reschedule.   The good news is that I did start working out with a personal trainer -- 3x or 4x per week, and I started making much healthier eating choices.  By Dec 2008 I had lost 30 pounds.  In mid-December, I also started have diabetes symptoms of being thirsty and frequent urination.   On Christmas day (after dinner, naturally) I tested and my blood sugar was 478.    My a1c (taken Dec 29, 2008) was 11.0.  I have since met with my doctor, started taking my medication again, and am even going through diabetes education again.   I am continuing to work out 4x - 5x per week, and continuing to make healthier eating choices.      My question is this:  The 30 pound weight loss -- do you think it was caused by an improved diet and exercise or the out-of-control blood sugars?   I am really hoping you say the diet and exercise, because the dietician I saw discounted the diet and exercise entirely which was EXTREMELY de-motivating.  And I need to stay motivated!   The meds are making it very difficult to continue to lose weight.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While out-of-control blood glucose can sometimes  cause precipitous weight loss, more often than not in cases such as you describe for yourself, the weight wasn't coming off until the diet and exercise program started, so you're probably not one of those who turn catabolic and lose weight due to metabolizing your own body fats (and muscle). You'd likely have had a much harder time with the training if that were the case. It honestly does sound as though you've lost this weight due to your own efforts, which is more normal and is highly commendable. You've chosen to take responsibility for your health and happiness, and deserve a great deal of credit as well as congratulations for having done so well. As to the dietician who discounted your hard work as a factor in the weight loss, I'm really surprised at this comment, because it's not that common  for people to suddenly experience significant weight loss immediately after reaizing their blood glucose levels are high. It's usually the other way around. They lose a bunch of weight and, in the course of a routine exam discover they're diabetic.   I think you can safely give yourself credit for this remarkable reversal. Keep up the good work!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would look to your breakfast foods.  Many people consume carbohydrates for breakfast which can result in some wide blood glucose fluctuations in those who are sensitive to it.  You didn't say what you eat but I would increase the protein and complex carbohydrates (fresh fruits and whole grains) which usually result in a more stable blood sugar level.  Also, your individual body may just process things differently at this time of day.  There is no magic formula that works for everyone so the fact that you have detected a pattern can make it easier to adjust your life to compensate.    About two hours after eating, take a protein snack.  This will probably help.  If you do not exercise or if you have extra weight to lose, those measures would be good to take.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Im a 33 year old female. I have been fairly healthy up until Nov 2007. The only condition I have is Hashimotto disease since 1995 but it has been under control with Synthroid.  On Nov 2007 I got really sick during a bussiness trip to Mexico. (extremelly tired, swollen face, swollen eyes, dark underneath eyes, and very thirsty). When I came back to the U.S. they run a MRI of my brain and the pituitary gland was inflamated--tumor--. A significant amount of test were conducted after that and the tumor was ruled out since the hormone levels were ok. Another MRI was executed just to make sure there was no tumor and the pituitary gland appeared perfectly normal, which are great news to me!!  However, I don't feel myself since then. My eyes are swollen all the time and very dark underneath them. I visited several opthalmologist and they agreed that the eyes are inflamated but they don't know the reason. One of the dr. said it could be Graves disease but others disagreed.  I also feel very tired and fatigued...more than normal fatigue and very cold all the time. Every now and then my face gets swollen, my hair really dry and sweat more than normal when I workout.  I have never suffer from PMS and for the past year I have had really bad PMS. They put me on Lexapro and it really helped for the fatigue but the eyes continue to be different than normal and the other symptoms continue to be there. I would love to hear any comments on possible things that could be happening with me. Thanks in advance,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Barbi -  Any one of the major disease processes your dad suffers from could contribute to accumulation of fluid in the legs. Poorly controlled diabetes can be a primary cause, or can contribute as a secondary cause due to damge to the kidneys. MS causes loss of muscle tone and in turn the muscles in the legs don't contribute much to blood return sometimes, which can allow fluid to break through the blood cells and collect in  the legs. Both these conditions,  plus emphysema, can contribute to congestive heart failure, which is one of the most common direct causes of this problem.  The underlying cause or causes will have to be diagnosed and treated and, in the meantime, medication to help reduce the  build-up of fluid can afford some relief. Several specialists will likely wind up involved in an effective effort to get your dad's organ systems working in concert again so as to avoid this sort of thing becoming chronic.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you and to your dad. Please follow up with us as neccessary.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: BROKEN TOE WITH DIABETES",
    "content": "Hi there -  While toe fractures such as you seem to have had usually get little to no medical attention beyond treating the symptoms, because they tend to resolve on their own if there's no deformity. They can bruise pretty badly however, and this then tends to filter out into the adjacent tissues. This wouldn't be much of a problem at all except that you've been recently diagnosed with diabetes, which can affect the speed of healing and especially so where the feet are concerned. However, if your diabetes is well controlled, this may not be a problem. If you test your glucose levels daily and they are within the acceptable range for controlled type II diabetes, you probably won't have any additional problem with the toe fracture. If it's very painful at least you've still got good sensation there (so the nerves haven't been damaged by diabetes). Treat the pain with over-the-counter pain meds such as iburprofin or,if that doesn't give you adequate relief, bring this up to your doctor. Also, the discoloration should continue to spread,but also should start to lighten  up (often  going from purple to yellowish as it slowly disappears). If things get worse instead of better, or if you notice any change in sensation (loss of feeling in the area) let your doctor know at once. Otherwise, it would seem you're probably safe to \"tough it out\", but with something for pain.   Hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  A fructosamine test is used in much the same way and for the same purpose as hemoglobin A1C is: to determine if the patient's glucose has been in or out of normal range over the previous few weeks, which  is helpful in determining whether or not the patient has diabetes or if diabetic treatment (or lack of it) is working well. If the level is elevated over the previous reading, it means the serum glucose has been elevated over the interim period. While there is no absolute \"normal\" level (different labs use different  \"normal\" values and different measures), the relative change, in per centage, is what tells the story. Your result would (or will, in the future) determine what the relative meaning is. In any event, based on the mmol/L standard, it isn't exceptionally high, but again, this will not mean as much as the relative change, if there is one.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

She quickly checked my sample and said I have glucose in my urine, that this could be a sign of kidney problems or a \"water infection\", but that it's probably nothing serious and that she would just bin it. At the time I just thought \"Ah okay, no biggy then.\" but reading online later I feel it's a bit more serious than how she took it? I have not had a blood sample taken so I don't know my bloodsugar levels, nor did she tell me anything specific about the urine sample, so my question is should I be concerned and go back with another sample? I feel fine, no urinary tract infection, I'm 25 years old, my bmi is 20.1, no one in my family has any kind of diabetes or cancer so I am just wondering if I should be worried or forget about this?

    "content": "Hello Xynne,  Normally, all the glucose in urine is reabsorbed by the kidneys.  There is a specific amount of glucose that can be reabsorbed during a specific period of time.  If there is too much glucose in the urine it cannot be fully reabsorbed and subsequently is spilled into the urine.  This would occur when the blood sugar is too high or if the kidney is not functioning properly.  There are various things that can cause this.  The first thing many people think of is diabetes because the elevated blood sugar results in overloading the kidneys and failure to reabsorb all the glucose.  However, this is only one of a number of things that can do this.  Some are transient and harmless.  I would suggest you first have the urinalysis repeated and check your blood glucose level.  Your primary care doctor can help sort all this out for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Deficiency of vitamin B group is one of the leading causes.  Compression of the root of leg nerves at the level of spinal column is another. Diabetes Mellitus of some years, especially if poorly controlled, can also cause this. Megaloblastic anemia with deficiency of Vit B12 and folic acid. Amyotropic lateral sclerosis, a spinal cord disease . Early stage of Gullian Barre syndrome, a viral disease.   However you say this occurs after you jog or walk for some time. This goes more in favor of Compression at spinal canal level. I suggest you get in touch with your doctor, get full blood work done, and if she agrees some z x rays for the spinal column too.

    "content": "I have type 2 diabetes and have lost about 75 lbs over the past two years with diet and exercise. I started at about 268 and am down to 195. My goal is to get down to 150 (which is the top end of normal bmi range for my height). When I mentioned this to my endocrinologist several months ago, she indicated that it would be really difficult for me to lose that much weight since I'm diabetic. She didn't give me any more details than that. I have gone through several long weight plateaus in the past 12 months, and I'm starting to get really discouraged. I've seen several non-diabetic friends lose much faster than I have. I eat healthy and exercise at least 3 times a week for at least half an hour. What would be a good weight loss goal for me if 150 is unreasonable?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello and congratulations on this wonderful success you have had so far!  Of course I don't know any details about your health and other factors but based on the information you have shared I see no reason why you could not achieve your goal weight.  If I were you I would consider seeing a registered dietician to help you plan an eating program with your goals in mind, based on BMI, activity levels and dietary restrictions.  I have seen successful weight loss efforts in diabetics and with exercise it is sometimes even possible to cure type II diabetes.  You didn't mention which type you have so I can't know if this is possible in your case or not, but recently the medical community has learned that type II diabetes is curable; not just manageable in some cases.  Keep up the good work - slow and easy will still win the race and you will be healthier if you can achieve this goal.    Best wishes.\n\n",

It's usually related to improper functioning of renal tubules (filters) which could be temporary. Some people have an inherited trait and will always show glucose in urine despite normal blood levels. These conditions are generally benign.  Diabetes is defined by its level in whole blood. Urine glucose is not diagnostic of diabetes.  Best wishes,\n\n",

    "content": "We have been going round and round with doctors trying to help my 5 year old son.  He is gross motor developmentally delayed since infancy but other wise has been healthy.  The only exception is that between the months of September and January of every year he gains substantial weight while his diet does not change.  He has poor muscle tone in is mouth which makes it difficult to chew so his diet has always consisted of a lot of pasta which he hardly chews if at all.  After seeing an endocrinologist last year (who didn't take my concern seriously), my pediatrican sent me to a Nutrionist this week.  So far this school year he as gained 10 pounds.  He is currently 70 pounds.  The nutrionist said that based on the fact that all of his weight is around his belly (from behind he doesn't even look overweight), he has a large dark patch on his arm, and suffers from night sweats and wakefulness during these gaining periods, she believes he is insulin resistant.  She also said that since he is not chewing his food and is not eating enough fiber or variety it is contributing to the problem.  She said that as summer ends and school begins his activity level is dropping too much and that is why the syptoms are being triggered.  He does not eat a lot of junk or sweets, as a matter of fact, he chooses to snack on fruits and vegetables.  We are currently cutting back portions of pasta, adding more protein and fiber, and increasing excersize.  I know you cannot diagnose but does it sound like she is on the right track?  He doesn't over eat and this seems to make sense as to why he is gaining.\n\n",

    "content": "The advice of the American Diabetes Association is \"when you choose to eat sweets, according to your individual diabetes and nutrition goals, substitute these foods for other carbohydrates in your meal plan.\"  Sugar has been shown to be something we all should take only in moderation.  Our love affair with sugar has caused great health concerns, including obesity, which is a risk factor for diabetes.  Small servings of sweets, if eaten at all, should always be chosen and it is best to balance the sugar in the meal with foods that are more stabilizing with blood sugar such as fiber and raw foods.  Eating a lot of sugar is risky for a diabetic and even if everything is controlled now, it may not be in the future and it is known that a \"sweet tooth\" is often obtained through habits.  Eating them regularly now will make it more difficult to change later on if things become less stable.  That said, if she is monitoring her glucose levels as well as her blood fats (HDL, LDL, triglycerides) and they are all stable, her risk is not as great as if they were also out of range.  If she is overweight, obviously the sugar will not help and will increase her risks.  Exercise also helps so this is an important part of the balance.  The main concern is keeping the glucose in check.  Keeping your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol under control can prevent diabetes problems, so the sugar is just a part of the whole picture.  I hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Samantha61,  A fasting glucose level of 6.6 mmol/L (approx. 119 mg/dl) is in the range considered impaired glucose tolerance (sometimes called prediabetes).  This is not considered overt diabetes.  Often an increased level like this correlates to some insulin resistance.  This can be induced/exacerbated by many different factors including increased weight and various other hormonal issues.  You may want to discuss this with your doctor.  Also, this level should be reconfirmed to be sure it wasn't a spurious level.  Unfortunately, your symptoms may actually be due to a number of other issues and the glucose is only one of the possible causes.  It sounds like you are in pretty good shape and living healthily.  I would suggest you see your doctor for a full evaluation. You may need some blood testing to look at things like your thyroid levels and electrolytes.  Best wishes.\n\n",

But, you can't really blame your problems on this because it may aggravate but doesn't actually cause the problem.    If you include proteins and complex carbohydrates in your diet regularly, that will help to stabilize the blood sugar.  Some people also take a supplement of chromium to help regulate their glucose because it is believed to enhance the action of insulin.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Kjunnan,  There are some signs that you may be in a \"pre-diabetes\" stage.  A fasting glucose of greater than 125 is considered diagnostic of diabetes (if confirmed by a second test).  Your level is very close to this which could indicate some impaired insulin usage.  Your hemoglobin A1c is also not typical of someone with normal insulin functioning (a normal range is around 5).  In diabetes the goal is to keep it less than 7 so this, again, does not particularly signal that you are diabetic but may be headed that way.  Even with this, a slightly elevated blood sugar is generally not enough to affect vision.  The visual changes occurring in conjunction with starting the topamax along with the eye specialist being concerned it is the topamax makes me very suspicious of the drug being the cause.  I would recommend you consider getting a second opinion about this.  I would also suggest you talk with an endocrinologist about your blood sugars to see if there may be some things to help prevent you from developing overt diabetes.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "31 F Factor V Leiden, ADD, Adrenal Adenoma R, Elevated DHEA, had gestational diabetes (borderline)  Currently taking ADD med, Vitamin & aspirin  I went to see my endocrinologist to get a game plan for the adrenal adenoma last week and this is what the plan is...  Metformin first - to ensure I do not become diabetic... at 3 months I start taking spironolactone followed by another CT scan to see if the adrenal tumor has grown.    Here is a history of my glucose levels via lab work.  Pregnancy : 02 1 hour glucose tolerance test :  152  3 hour glucose tolerance test after following 3 day diet.  FBS : 81 / 1 hr : 159 / 2 hr : 169 / 3 hr : 56     From what I understood at the time was that I was borderline and was sent to see a nutritionist and followed a healthy diet for the remainder of my pregnancy with no problem.  I found out afterwards that they did actually diagnose me with gestational diabetes.  After Pregnancy glucose levels :   JUL 03 --  non fasting : 81 NOV 06 -- non fasting : 91 SEP 07 -- Fasting : 88 OCT 07 -- non fasting : 85  The reason I give my glucose history is because I am not sure why I am taking the Metformin.  The doctor I am seeing said he wants me to take it to ensure I do not become diabetic in the future.    I took the doses specified (500 mg w/ breakfast) and (500 mg w/ dinner).  I started on a Wednesday night and felt fine, took the med on Thursday morning with my meal and felt fine for about 2 hours and then I started feeling tired.  With each additional evening and morning dose I felt more and more tired, my energy levels bottomed out.  I exercise every day, between bootcamp classes, pilates and 12 mile walks I think I am in pretty decent shape with decent energy.  I tried to take my cardio sports class on Friday morning and could barely get through it.  I just felt very tired and sick.  Saturday the tiredness was worse and I came very close to actually vomiting after eating, I also felt very out of it (Spacey).  I still took Saturday evenings dose, but woke up feeling horrible on Sunday so I stopped taking the medication and felt so much better by Sunday evening when I took a bodyflow class.  One thing I noticed throughout the last two days on the medication and am not sure it is related... my toenails were turning grey / blue.  Since stopping they are returning back to the normal pinkish color.  I called my Doctor first thing Monday morning and was called back today by the medical assistant and instructed to take the meds only at night and only 500 mg.  I asked if I could just work on keeping a healthy diet and exercise program and just monitor my sugar levels and was told the doctor wants me to take the meds.    My question is :  If I am not diabetic, my bloodwork is not showing signs of pre-diabetes, and I do exercise regularly and eat healthy foods; why can't I just keep the healthy diet and exercise and watch my glucose levels?  Why take medicine for a condition I do not have to ensure I don't get it, especially when I am not showing any signs of developing it?  I'm reluctant to start taking the Metformin again because of how it made me feel, but am not sure that I am understanding the whole situation.  I know that I do not want diabetes, but I thought being healthy via diet & exercise was a good way to keep your levels in check.  I really do appreciate your feedback on this.  Have a wonderful day.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Backtowork,  There are many different brands of glucose monitors available.  Really they are all basically the same.  Some have different types of strips that use less blood allowing more sights of the body to be used for testing.  Others store test strips in the glucometer.  Still others are smaller and more compact.  All of them are reliable for glucose monitoring.  Basically, it comes down to finding one that you like.  Some people will like some features so my advice is to get several together and take a look at them in the store to see which one you like.  Best wishes.\n\n",

At my last labwork, we also did a 2 hour post prandial glucose test, and that result came back at a measure of was 118.  I understand the fasting numbers to be \"prediabetic' as they are above 100.  However, the post prandial of 118 is a value which I understand is considered to be considered normal (less than 140).  Assuming both the high fasting and normal post prandial numbers are correct, what meaning should I attach to them as far as determining how to best manage my high fasting condition going forward?\n\n",

At other times, it just hurts like hunger pains & makes me sick.   About 5 hours after not eating, I checked my glucose (showing pre-diabetes), then I ate, and re-checked it one hour later, and my glucose level dropped (in normal range though), but one hour after that, I re-checked it again and it had raised even higher than the first result (pre-diabetes again).   I thought your glucose was supposed to raise 1 hr after eating, and then be lower within 2 hrs. Do these results make any sense?\n\n",

    "content": "There is a reason we don't go around routinely checking our glucose unless we have had initial screening and testing indicating a problem with it.  The body is designed to maintain the right balance of insulin and glucose so that we don't have to go around connected to an IV for constant even administration - think about the nights while we sleep - the body manages to keep things in balance.  It does this by raising and lowering levels as necessary, using glucose stores in the body, but it does not do it by the clock.  So, no matter what \"normal\" or \"average\" may be, your body may be on a different schedule.  I would not worry about this so much.    Everyone experiences times of occasional hypoglycemia and it's only when the body is incapable of maintaining the normal levels that we worry.  This happens with diabetes.  If you are worried about your health, please schedule an exam with your doctor then explain the symptoms as you have described them here.  There are plenty of reasons for fatigue, dizziness, feeling faint, etc.  Blood sugar fluctuations are just one of these.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Benster,  There is some data to suggest that dark chocolate may have some protective effects.  The problem is that there is not enough research to be sure and it is more likely that the effects on your blood sugar would negate any benefit, as you've suggested.  Getting your blood sugar under control and bringing your Hemoglobin A1c down to below 7 are likely to be the best things you can do to prevent further damage to the nerves and blood vessels.  Glucose is an essential component of life but in high levels it becomes toxic so keeping the blood sugar normal is really critical to minimizing and preventing effects of diabetes.

    "content": "Hi Arthole,  Pregnancy can have varying effects on diabetes.  It is very important that she continue to follow up with her obstetrician.  If her diabetes is well managed and her blood sugar is controlled the pregnancy is very likely to be normal.  Poorly controlled diabetes can have dramatic effects on the baby including delayed lung development, cardiac problems and colon problems.  Keeping the blood sugar under control does not totally remove the risk to the baby, unfortunately.  Diabetes in pregnancy makes the pregnancy slightly higher risk but good follow up with her obstetrician will minimize these risks.  Diabetics routinely have pregnancies and deliveries with normal healthy babies.  From your prior post I seem to recall that there was a possibility of her diabetes being poorly controlled.  I would again advise her to see her doctor and get this dealt with, for the baby's health and, just as importantly, for her own health.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It has been lasting for about an hour. For 3 days my stools have been black and tarry. I do not know what to do. I am at my whits end.

Diabetes could explain your symptoms although it would be a little atypical presentation.  Checking for this is definitely worthwhile.  I would also recommend you have your thyroid levels checked again to make sure they are still OK.  You may also want to see a neurologist for their perspective on things as well.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The other day I worked out and soon after i had a strong pain in the abdominal area (not a cramp), and it went away as soon as I ate some pretzeles and fruit.

I also have noticed that I don't go to the bathroom at night anymore, but I wake up and feel like my blatter is about to burst. I used to always wake up at night when I needed to go, but not it seems like I don't wake up to go, my body just holds it until I wake up. Also, sometimes when I eat sweets I get a pain on my right lower side of my abdomin. Im a very healthy girl though, I work out everyday, and eat VERY healthy. Is this diabetes or am I just noticeing things that are normal and makeing something of them?\n\n",

    "content": "I have Type II diabetes.  I was managing it OK on Glucaphage, Avandia and Glymeperide but i need to lose about 40 pounds (I am a 57 year old woman).  So, my Endo removed the Glymerpride and cut my Glucophage from 1000 to 500 mg a day and kept the avandia, and statred me on Byeta self-injections.  I used the 5 MG pen for 30 days with no noticeable effects and good bloodsugar readings.  I started on the 10 MG pen 3.5 weeks ago.  I am concerned about a side effect.  I know a lot of users report nausea in first 2-4 weeks on 10MG but my side-effect symptoms seem different than what I read everywhere on the Byeta and Diabetes Blogs and Discussion Forums.  Can yoiu tell me if my symptoms as described below seem typical for a new Byeta User or worrisome?    I do not get a typical bout of Nausea that might be likened to \"flu stomach\" or seasickness.  I get a bloated, stomach distending, over-full pressure in my stomach and up through mid rib-cage following injection and meal.  It feels like when I was a kid and drank way too much water too quicly leaving me feeling as if my stomach wanted to pop.  It's a very uncomfortable inside pressure and bloated feeling.  Sometimes it just goes away within an hour or two, but since starting on 10-MG injections, after an hour or so, my mouth SUDDENLY starts to water and I have to run to toilet to vomit.  I continue to vomit repeatedly until my stomach is emptied.  Then I feel fine again.  As I mentioned, I know the nausea is common at this stage, but it is this internal stomach pressure and sudden urge to vomit (and then vomitng out all stomach contents).  This is not just \"feeling full\".  It is very, very uncomfoirtable overly-full feeling as if forced to eat/drink too much and goes beyond feeling of needing to unsnap pants.  I cannot correlate what I have eater on the days I throw up.  asd for timing, I usually eat within 10-15 minutes of injection.  I know I should report to my Endo but he is in CA and I now live in AZ so it is hard to get back there and he does not do phone consults.  I do need to find an Endo here and am trying to get recommendations.  But I need to know if there is some urgency because these symptoms are different than expected and generally reported, or whether they seem normal and I can take my time fnding an Endo i will be comfortable with.  Also, if my sugars are under control at 5 MG along with my Oral Meds, is there some reason why I need to take the 10 MG?  I never had these side effects oin the 5 MG.  THANK YIOU FOR YOUR EXPERT OPINION!  Mimi\n\n",

Having said that, your symptoms may definitely be related to your medication, particularly since they are related in time to your injections and started after the dose increase.  I am not sure why you needed the increased dose.  It would seem that the lower dose would be sufficient but I cannot say for sure.  If you are unable to tolerate the lower dose you may need to go back down.  It's good that you are seeking an local endocrinologist to help sort this out for you.  This really is the way to go.

    "content": "Hi, I suffer alot with hypoglycemia (and other problems) In the mornings my blood sugar levels are usually low (has been as low as 1.4mmol) i know that it can be lower than the normal range in the mornings but it is usually in the low 3's and 2'smmol. What i wanted to know is this:  the last couple of days my blood sugar has been 5.6mmol etc in the morning.It has never been anywhere near the 5'smmol in the mornings since ive been testing it (every morning - it hardlty ever goes above the low 4'smmol). About an hour-hour and a half before i tested it i woke feeling really hungery/ strange feeling hard to describe. Could my blood sugar have been higher than usual because my sugar levels had dropped? please post back. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "With insulin use there are two things that can commonly cause elevated morning blood sugars.  One is called the dawn phenonmenon.  This is when the blood sugar goes up in the morning because many of the body's hormones such as growth hormone and cortisol peak in the morning time and counter act the effects of insulin.  The other effect, it appears more likely in your case, is known as the somogyi effect.  This is when the blood glucose level dips low during the night.  As a result, the body releases lots of counter-insulin hormones to raise the blood sugar causing it to be elevated in the morning.  If you are using insulin it may be that you need less at night.  If you are not using insulin you may need to talk with your doctor about a medication to blunt the effects of insulin some to keep you from going low.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "There may be several reasons to undergo a fast.  During these times, the body's ability to regulate blood sugar is tested since there is not an incoming source of blood sugar.  A normal response to low blood sugar would be for insulin levels to go down and counter-insulin hormones such as glucagon to increase.  This response also shifts the body into \"fuel making\" mode.  Ketones are one such alternative energy source for the body (other than glucose).  If the blood sugar goes abnormally low it may be because there is too much insulin or too little counter hormones.  When the blood sugar is low, insulin levels can be measured.  C-Peptide is an indirect way of measuring insulin levels.  C-peptide is created when the preinsulin molecule is cut into the insulin molecule.  If ketones are absent during low blood sugar states it is more likely that too much insulin is present (inhibiting ketone production).  If ketones are present it is more likely that the counter hormones are not quite doing their job.  I hope this helps some.  Best wishes.\n\n",

This is why the feet tend to be affected before the legs are, etc.    It would be a bit unusual, though not impossible, to start getting symptoms at the elbow first then subsequently get hand findings.  You may want to see a neurologist for some nerve testing if there is concern for the possibility of a neuropathy.  Another possibility is a nerve impingement syndrome where the nerve gets trapped, sometimes due to swelling of tissues around it (such as may  happen with an overuse syndrome like tennis elbow).

Lastley I had a fasting blood glucose test take the other day prior to havingthe blood taken I checked the level on my blood glucose monitor it was 1.2mmol, I know they aren't very accurate, however when I got the result I was told that the levels were normal. How come an hour before the blood was taken it was 1.2mmol and then an hour later the doc is telling me it is normal? (I know that the home blood glucose moniotrs arnt totaly accurate but its only about 15% difference itsnt it) Therefore if it is right what causes the blood sugar to change so rapidly?    please post back,\n\n",

    "content": "Blood sugars can fluctuate quite rapidly.  When the body recognizes blood sugars that are too low, the body kicks into gear and releases several hormones to rapidly increase the blood sugar.    There are a few conditions that can cause hyperinsulinemia resulting in low blood sugars.  Also, a lack of one of the counter-insulin hormones will make hypoglycemia more likely.  There are a number of blood tests that can be done to look at insulin levels and the counter-insulin hormone levels.  The trick is that the blood tests need to be done while the blood sugars are low.  Unfortunately, I'm not as familiar with these units for blood sugar so I am having a little bit of a hard time judging how low your blood sugar is so I'm hesitant to make any comment about the significance of your blood levels.

IV contrast can be damaging to the kidneys, especially if there is already a decrease in function.  As to the reasoning behind the need for an angiogram I suspect that the doctor is still concerned about peripheral artery disease.  Ultrasounds are good for the areas they are looking at but an angiogram gives a much larger picture.  I cannot say as to why this would be needed if the area is healing.  My best advice is to talk with the doctor about why it is being ordered.  In general, though, IV contrast should be avoided with elevated creatinine if possible (although this is not a 100% contraindication).  It's risks vs. benefits, really.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Morning fasting BG levels are in normal range 80s-90s.  My GP has tested me twice over the last few weeks ~4 hours after eating and the BG results were 161 & 110.  I have since been sent for a CT pelvis/abdominal scan and am awaiting the results.  My doctor did mention virus or infection as the possible cause of the high BG readings but my CBC, LFTs, BUN & Creatinine are within normal limits.  Are these BG numbers high enough for concern?  I have used prednisone over the past couple years to treat the inflammation realted to the AS and even higher doses to control the Sweet's Syndrome.  In 2006 I spent 10 months of the year on steroid therapy.  Could this be a contributing factor?  Could my adrenals be exhausted?    Oddly enough my sex drive has increased to the point my husband can't keep up.

    "content": "I am a 22-year old female, 5'3, 129lbs. Over the years, I have had constant issues with fatigue, migraines, just generally feeling unwell, amongst other things. A few years ago, my doctor ran a blood test on me and my glucose level came back at 1.2mmol/L. I believe this would have been a random sample as I had only eaten a few hours before. He said I appeared to be a 'little hypoglycemic' but didn't ever say much about it. From looking into hypoglycemia myself and even consulting a few diabetic friends that I have, it would seem that for me to have a level of 1.2, I should have been unconscious. A few years later now, I am still living and breathing, still experiencing the same symptoms but I have never followed up on it. I know when I need to eat because it hits me hard and I feel very disoriented. I also found out a few years ago that I am severely anemic with my iron level staying at around a 6. Is this something I should be more concerned about?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Linz, I would be interested in seeing the original lab results your MD was relaying to you.   As you have researched for yourself, a true 1.2 mmol/L blood glucose level (which translates into about a 21 blood glucose level when measuring mg/dl - typical US measurements)  is certainly more than \"slightly\" hypoglycemic and is in fact alarmingly low.  I wonder if he either mis-spoke the level to you or something like that.  The world standard of measurement is different from the traditional US one, and it would help to be clear which standard he was referring to and clarify the test results. Also, I am not clear about your reference to being anemic while referring to an iron level of 6.  The standard iron level for females is between 65 and 165.  It seems odd that you would have an iron level as low as 6.  However, a hemoglobin of 6 is indeed very low, but can occur in severe anemia, or traumatic blood loss. This level also needs to be clarified for us to help your understanding. If your doctor's  intention was for you to increase your iron uptake from a nutritional standpoint, you can do so by improving your iron-rich intake of meats (especially organ meats); poultry (especially dark meat); fish - especially shellfish and sardines and anchovies; leafy greens of the cabbage family, such as broccoli, kale , turnip greens, etc; legumes - such as limas green peas, dry beans and even canned baked beans; yeast -leavened whole wheat breads; and iron enriched breads, pasta, rice and cereals. I would be very concerned if you have a hemoglobin of 6.  That is about half the \"normal\" level for an adult female.  Severe hypoglycemia and severe anemia can each contribute to your overall feelings of malaise. It would be of value for you to have additional tests run to verify the results you were given, such as a BMP (basic metabolic profile) and CBC (complete blood count), and a Hgb A1c (hemoglobin A1c - a way of seeing what your blood sugar has been over about a 3 month span of time.)\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry, I should clarify that I live in Canada so we more than likely use a different measurement. I actually saw the test results as they were read to me and my blood glucose did read 1.2 mmol/L as I was curious and wanted to see for myself. My diabetic friends say that I should be at around a 5 or a 6 on a glucometer to be healthy.  The same goes for the iron results on the blood tests. Perhaps I am mistaken and it is the hemoglobin that is low. I was just told that my iron is really low but I know iron and hemoglobin are closely involved. I have had a series of blood tests run for the anemia because I was put on iron supplements and my doctor was trying to increase it. Even with iron supplements it only goes up to around 21 after three months. It doesn't help that I am a vegetarian but I was actually first diagnosed with the anemia prior to becoming a vegetarian. The possible anemia first came to my attention when I went to donate blood and they wouldn't accept me. They require a person's blood iron to be at a minimum of 25. I'm not sure what unit of measurement this is in. I currently take 600mg of Palafer/day. It's funny because I knew my iron had to be really low when my doctor saw my blood results and said that she was surprised I was functioning. Perhaps I will try and get a copy of those blood tests for review.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Linz, Thank you for the clarifications.  Yes, using the mmol/L scales, your friends are right that 5 or 6 is a healthier level for your blood sugar.  The study of nutrition can be very complicated especially when coupled with lifestyles such as vegetarianism.  Has your doctor checked your B-12 and folate levels?  How is your intake of Vitamin C? Are you vegan, or vegetarian?  Are you consuming large quantities of milk (if you are ovo-lacto-vegetarian) to provide proteins (which can adversely affect  your iron stores)?  Have you had your protein, albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin levels and other items checked by an endocrinologist or even an  RD (registered dietition)?.  Due to the multiple concerns you have, and the current threat to your health between hypoglycemia and iron-deficient anemia, I strongly encourage you to seek input from these specialists.  There may be some commonality to both disorders found in the kinds of foods you choose to eat, as well as an underlying pathology.\n\n",

    "content": "You raise an interesting question.  Does Type 2 diabetes worsen sleep apnea?  There are several studies showing that the two do run together.  I found several studies that showed that improving sleep apnea would actually help bring Diabetes under control.  Both appear to be associated with insulin resistance.  Type 2 diabetes is essentially severe insulin resistance.  I am not aware of the link between insulin resistance and obstructive apnea.  One link in some people is obesity.  Obesity is a predisposer to diabetes.  However, this link does not seem to hinge on obesity.  It may be that if you are able to get better control of your sleep apnea your blood sugars may improve.  I did not find much regarding the reverse trend, i.e. improving diabetes resulting in improving sleep apnea.  However, if there is a predisposing factor to both and one is able to be improved, there may be an improvement of the other.  This is definitely an area of ongoing research.  Great question.  I wish I had more information for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

They has never really been any change in my sugars and my doctor keeps telling me to increase by 4 units every 4 days till I see some change.

    "content": "Type 2 diabetes is caused by the body being resistant to insulin.  In some people it only takes a little extra insulin to overcome this resistance.  In others, it may take very large amounts.    I do have one suggestion for you.  You may want to talk with your doctor about changing from NPH to glargine insulin.  Glargine is essentially a 24 hour insulin.  NPH often will last for 8-12 hours.  Glargine can help provide a constant insulin amount as a basal level.  Then, when you would still use your rapid acting insulin (the NovaRapid) when you need the increased amounts of insulin such as at meal time.  The key to finding the proper amount is to keep working up slowly.  I've had some patients on 60 or 80 units of insulin a day while others have only needed 5 or 10 units.  Unfortunately, I do not know of any way to determine which a person will be other than by trying an amount and working up as needed.  You can also work with your doctor to optimize your insulin sensitizing medications such as metformin or some of the other types of Diabetes medications.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Type 2 diabetes (formerly known as adult onset) mellitus is thought to be caused some by genetics and some by environment.  Staying healthy, eating well, exercising and being sure to watch your weight may prevent you from developing diabetes.  Signs to watch for are increasing thirst, increasing urination, and increasing hunger.  In type 2 diabetes, the problem is that the body becomes resistant to the insulin it is making, requiring more insulin to produce the same amount.  Eventually the body is simply not able to make enough insulin to overcome the resistance and blood sugars begin to rise.    Other symptoms include darkening of the skin on the back of the neck, knuckles and finger joints (known as acanthosis nigricans), fatigue, blurry vision, and a feeling as if the brain is running slower than it should.  One should keep in mind, however, that type 2 diabetes may have no symptoms at all.  As such, it is important to follow up with your doctor and get regular laboratory check ups (including a fasting insulin level and hemoglobin A1c, a test for long term blood sugar levels).  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Factors involved in the disorder include :  - Direct trauma or injury to the wrist resulting in swelling swelling,.  - Work stress , repetitive movement can cause tendinitis (like in your case) - Swellings due to hormonal disturbances like pituitary gland hyperactivity; Hypothyroidism; rheumatoid Arthritis; - Fluid retention due to hormonal changes like in pregnancy.  - A cyst or tumor formation in the canal.  - In some cases there is no apparent cause.  - Uncontrolled Diabetes may aggrevate the symptoms.  Treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome is preferred to start as early as possible. Underlying causes should be treated first.   General measures include:  Rest of the affected hand and wrist for at least 2 weeks and immobilizing the wrist in a splint to avoid further damage from twisting or bending.  - Use of cool to reduce swellings if any is present.  - medications like NSAID  - Finally surgery is recommended to complicated persistent cases for 6 month after conservative measures.  Follow up with your doctor is  essential. Best regards.\n\n",

His blood sugar (after fasting) was 114, his cholesterol was 225 and his bad cholesterol at 135.  There is no family history of diabetes.  His doctor said that he may want to start to treat him as a diabetic.  Is that blood sugar too high?  How much weight would he need to lose to make a difference in his blood sugar?

    "content": "It seems like a borderline case. Most of the clinicians would have a bit of different approach.  As per the information I have gathered :-  Blood pressure - Seems to be well controlled. Norvasc 10 mg should be continued and BP should be monitered at regular intervals.  Blood Sugar - Fasting blood sugar > 125 on 2 different occasions would worry me. As of now most of the clinicians would like to advice regular exercise and diet control.  Lipid Profile - Bad cholesterol of 135 is slightly on higher side.  Your husband falls into > 2 risk factors category(hypertension and age > 45). So his target LDL (bad cholesterol) level should be < 130.   Other risk factors - Diabetes, smoking, HDL (good cholesterol) < 40, early CAD (heart disease) in first-degree relatives.  So at this stage, starting lipid lowering drugs is more desirable than starting meds for diabetes.  I understand, different opinions are confusing. But the best judge is the one who persoanally examines the patient.  Why do we take so many measures even if the patient don't have any symptoms?  To minimise risk of CAD (heart disease), as all the above factors are proven risk factors of heart disease.  I hope this will help.\n\n",

I have heard conflicting information about that. He eats alot of sweets and drinks soda.  I think that is where -we will start first.  (In addition to any treatment from his doctor)  I don't think eliminating them is practical for him, but I will encourage less donuts, brownies and ice cream.   He lifts weights, but I will try to encourage him to start using the treadmill and bike at work (He is a professional firefighter and can work out during work hours).  I'm thankful that some of this is being caught before it gets out of hand.  I think with some diet modifications and different exercise, things can begin to improve.  He will be seeing his doctor again within the next few weeks.  Thanks Jenny\n\n",

Others may experience a feeling like the food stuck in their throat or tightness in the throat, dry Cough and Shortness of breath similar to Asthma.   Stress and smoking can increase these symptoms. Certain foods as well are known to aggravate the condition, and you better avoid them.   - Psychological or emotional stress and Anxiety, in these cases the diagnosis is made by exclusion of other causes.   -IBS: Commonly people who have IBS complaint of Abdominal pain or colic A bloated abdomen  Gaseous distension Either Diarrhea or constipation or an alternating between both of them  - Muscle spasm also hould be excluded , it can cause similar pain and result from inappropriate posture or sudden wrong movement.  In these cases, self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain  Diagnosis is made by complete history taking, physical examination, investigations like Upper Endoscopy, Manometric studies, and other lab tests that can be recommended by the doctor accordingly.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 48 with heart disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and a few other things. My asthma has been very bad lately and the emergency room doc gave me a prescription for high doses of prednisone to taper off in a few days. My sugar is through the roof this morning at 264. I am on metformin. I wonder if I can temporarily increase the morning dose. Later on in the day if I am careful to eat right, the sugar goes to a reasonable level around 130--not good control but much better. The upside to this is that my arthritis flare is getting very much better and my knees don't hurt. The asthma is a lot better too, but by the late afternoon the fatigue is overwhelming and the breathing problems are requiring the rescue inhaler. I didn't know it was better to take the prednisone in the daytime so I took it late at night and stayed up all the first night. Now I am taking it a couple of hours earlier till it is gone or till it doesn't keep me awake.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi wallsy, If you have experienced 13 hospital admissions in the past year then your Diabetes is not likely controlled. Diabetic Ketoacidosis occurs because the body has insufficient or lack of insulin. This leaves the body with the inability to convert glucose/sugar/carbohydrates for fuel as in normal metabolism to using muscle, fat, etc., for fuel causing the production of ketones. This in turn causes an increased blood sugar levels. Are you on insulin? Many people are under the misconception that Diabetes is \"only\" a malfunction of the pancreas and that is the only organ affected. The whole picture of Diabetes is it is a systemic disease that affects all body organs. Left uncontrolled, through improper diet, inadequate medications, etc. may cause severe consequences. Although in a very small percentage of people Diabetic Ketoacidosis may occur without an identifiable cause, this condition often occurs in people who have been previously undiagnosed with diabetes, have uncontrolled diabetes, or improperly use diabetic medications/insulin. Certain medications, (ie., steroids for other conditions, etc.) infection, stress and recent surgical procedures of course play a role in elevating blood sugar levels. I would strongly encourage you to have an evaluation by a specialist, an Endocrinologist. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

My question is what I need to be looking out for, she doesn't really eat , and doesn't watch her grams of carbs and eats chocolate and she drinks coffee and Dr. pepper and diet dp pretty much all day, never any water.. She smokes at least 6 cigarettes everyday. Her blood sugar levels stay from 175 up to 300, she checks it about 5 times a day, and sometimes when I've looked at her log it has been up to 490. I've seen it low only a few time, down to 47.So, I am very concerned, she has been depressed for about 4 yrs after losing her husband and goes to work and sleeps once she gets home and basically all day on the weekends. She is on antidepressents from her family healh care provider. I made an appt. for her to see an endocrinologist and made her go, I took her  and they went over what she needs to do and when we left she was crying and said she wasn't going back. I have tried to show her everything so she won't be so overwhelmed but nothing works, so she does nothing. Over the past few days she has been told that she has lupus which affects you organs also such as kidneys etc. She is very tired all the time, has shaking spells and is out of it,  so what do I need to be concerned  about and watch out for and what would you recommend me doing?

    "content": "Hi makenzie, Although your mom has significant physical medical problems, it seems that she has also had psychological problems related to depression. A counselor's evaluation would be recommended. Since she has not adequately dealt with the loss of her husband, (gone through the greiving process) and it appears that she is in the state of mind that she doesn't care what happens to her. This does happen to some people in which they have had difficulty coping with a traumatic life changing event. Once this issue is dealt with and resolved, and she has the opportunity to realize that living doesn't have to stop because of the death of a loved one, then she will be better to deal with her own physical medical problems. Physical inactivity makes depression even worse, not to mention the affect it has on her already existing medical problems. It essentially causes worsening episodes of uncontrolled diabetes. The implications this has alone by nature, due to the fact that it is a systemic illness affecting all organs can have severe long term complications. I hope that counseling, by a professional, has been sought. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "hi,   Diabetes, like every life-long disease,  requires a close liasion between the physician and the patient.  In answering your questions, you need to know two basic facts:  1. The damage in diabetes is due to uncontrolled hyperglycemia (raised blood glucose)  2. The insulin dose and diet of the patient have been properly worked out by the physician and the patient. So, as long as the patient follows his diet chart, he will not get extremely deviated from normal range of glucose.  Having said that, the sliding scale was used to get an estimate of what units of insulin patient requires. Say, for example the random glucose is 360, now the insulin dose was worked out to bring it down to near-normal.  But the damage has already been done. The high glucose has contributed its bad effects.  The fixed dose insulin uses a standard units/kg schedule to start on, which is later individualized for each patient. This results in a much better glycemic control. The patient seldom has raised glucose.  The sliding scale is still used in surgical units and ORs for short term treatment of diabetes just before or after surgery.  The type of inulin used in sliding scale is Regular insulin.  Usually, it is best to follow the fixed dose plan. Dual plans are used normally when switching over to fixed schedule or to achieve a better control in a hospital setting.  Answering your second query, if the value of blood glucose is low, you should still administer insulin IF this is a pre-meal reading, as a positive shoot is going to happen in 30 minutes!  The regular insulin is to be avoided if this was a bed time reading.\n\n",

So, you should not be worried.  I think the doctor is true in saying that a shifting of sugar and BP towards normal is causing such spots.  I have some questions in mind: Do these spots remain at the same place? or do they move around as you move your gaze?  Is it possible that they have been there for quite sometime and you have noticed them now?  Also, it'd be helpful if you provide your age, time since diagnosis, glucose and BP values when diagnosed, and the values now.  Thanks, Najaf Haider MBBS\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your response.  In answer to your queries I would like to try and describe my sumptoms in a little more detail (so please patient with me!).    \u2022\tI'm aware of yellow-blue-pink cloudy areas in both eyes. The cloud that worries me most is in my right eye; it is a prominent cloud in my central line of vision. The 'clouds' seem to shimmer with little black dots. When I close my eyes I can still see the clouds which seem 'illuminated'.  The problem started 2 months ago and was limited to my right eye, in the last week the problem has started to happen in my left eye with a new cloud appearing everyday.  The only thing I can even vaguely compare it to is the aura migraine sufferers experience \u2013 except that this stays (it occasionally fades and then flairs up again).  I\u2019ve also had this clouds appear and then disappear in about 24 hours (although these were in peripheral vision and I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re just less noticeable)  \u2022\tWith my right eye, when l focus in to read say newspaper print I'm aware of grey patches (which also shimmer with black dots) in the areas where I experience the clouds. If I am reading newsprint then the patches obscure the bottom half of the work I am reading and also words along to the left and right. \u2022\tI'm seeing all sorts of black, blue & white spots in both eyes which flash. These disturbances seem to react to light.   \u2022\tI am experiencing a strange phenomenon where I see 'static' which looks like a TV with bad reception - this is most prominent in poor or low light conditions and also on first waking up I have been diabetic for 5 years - but have not controlled it very well.  about 7 weeks ago I approached my doctor because I wanted to address this.  My BP then was 180/100 and when I had it checked about a week ago it was 145/80.  My HB1C was around 12 6 weeks ago - I'm having another blood test in a month.  My recent daily bloods test have shown my sugar levers to be between 6 & 7.\n\n",

A dilated pupil indirect fundoscopy will detect any changes in the retina (the main component in sight). A good doctor having experience is necessary to pick up details.  A perimetry will detect any actual loss in your visual field, and is usually computerized.  Normal studies should allay your worries.\n\n",

    "title": "Gangrene",
    "content": "Dear hhoolliiee, There are many causes for gangrene of lower limbs.  arteriosclerosis obliterans and thromboangitis obliterans account for 95% of all cases of pvd (peripheral vascular disease) causing damage, additional causes of gangrene are:    Raynauds disease or syndrome    vascular changes with diabetes mellitus    polycythemia    sickle cell anaemia    arterial or venous embolism    phlegmasia cerulea dolens    ergotism and frostbite    severe trauma    chemical injury    congenital anularia constrictions    keratosis hereditarium mutilans    severe and complicated cutaneous pyodermas    hypogamma-globulinemia    cryoglobulinemia and pyoderma gangrenosum    dermatitis nodularis necrotica,    various types of vasculitis    subacute bacterial endocarditis    collagen disease    leprosy    tuberculosis    erysipelas and surgical infections of the palms  Some of these causes do run in families. Please state the cause which the doctor said led to the gangrene in your family members. Were they all diabetic.  One of the causes stated above is Raynaud's Disease:  Definition  Episodic vasospasm (constriction of small arteries) of the digits. It is characterized by digital blanching, cyanosis(blue), a feeling of numbness or dulled sensory response and rubor (red) after cold exposure and rewarming. It can also be induced by anxiety or stress. This condition is primarily confined to the fingers and toes but can affect areas of the body such as your nose, cheeks, ears and even tongue. Blanching represents the ischemic (lack of adequate blood flow) phase of the phenomenon, caused by digital artery vasospasm. Cyanosis results from deoxygenated blood in capillaries and venules (small veins). Upon rewarming and resolution of the digital vasospasm, a hyperemic phase ensues, causing the digits to appear red. Raynaud's can be a primary or secondary disorder.  Primary Raynaud's phenomenon is also called Raynaud's disease. Criteria for Raynaud's disease include episodic digital ischemia (sequence of color changes in the skin in response to cold or stress), a numb, prickly feeling or stinging pain upon warming or relief of stress, absence of arterial occlusion, bilateral distribution, absence of symptoms or signs of other diseases that also cause Raynaud's phenomenon, and duration of symptoms for 2 years or longer. Most people with Raynaud's disease develop symptoms before they reach 40 years of age. It can occur in young children. Raynaud's disease affects women three to five times more frequently than men. The prevalence is lower in warm climates than in cold climates.  An important point is to differentiate between Raynaud's and acrocyanosis, a condition in which there is persistent bluish discoloration of the hands or feet. Like Raynaud's phenomenon, cyanotic discoloration intensifies during cold exposure, and rubor may appear with rewarming. Acrocyanosis affects both men and women, and the age at onset is usually between 20 and 45 years. The prognosis of patients with idiopathic acrocyanosis is good, and loss of digital tissue is uncommon. Patients should avoid cold exposure and dress warmly. Pharmacologic intervention usually is not necessary. Alpha-adrenergic blocking agents and calcium channel blockers may be effective in some patients with acrocyanosis.  Hope this info helps.\n\n",

Ketoacidosis typically evolves slowly but can become lifethreatening in a matter of only a few hours. There are warning signs that should be paid attention to, for example, Thirst or a very dry mouth, frequent urination, high blood glucose (sugar) levels, high levels of ketones in the urine.  Next, other symptoms appear  Constantly feeling tired, flushed skin.  A hard time breathing (short, deep breaths), fruity odor on breath, confusion.  Nausea, vomiting, (if vomiting continues for more than 2 hours, contact your health care provider).  Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) may also result in coma. Again there are warning signs of hypoglycemia, sweating, nausea, dizziness, tremors/shakiness, confusion, seizure, etc. When any of the symptoms or warning signs become apparent of either of the above conditions test your glucose levels and yes it's wise to keep an emergency kit available.

    "content": "I live with my mother-in-law, who has many health problems including diabetes, meniere's disease, and sleep disorders, in which she will stay awake and panicked for about 2 or three days and then sleep for one or two. She has a horrible diet of mainly pastries, bad balance (she falls often..sometimes down stairs and whatnot), and often skips medication. We have told her about the health problems she is creating for herself, but she seems unmotivated to change her bad habits and feels as if we are just lecturing her. We are fearful to move away because we feel responisible for her well-being - without us injuries could go without medical attention for a long time. She has only us. I'm very confused about what to do. She has already had blood clots and she fears she is having a \"silent stroke,\" yet does nothing to help herself. Do you have any advice for this situation? Thanks so much for your time and effort. Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi w116alj, The sad thing is that it is very difficult to help someone whom is unwilling to help themselves. Here are a few things that I can suggest. There should be a Diabetes program at your local hospital or in your community that has very helpful information regarding this condition. Contact the information center at your local hospital and inquire about available programs, generally offered for free or at a low cost. Meniere's disease and sleep disorders are both treated with medications but if she is not taking them correctly they don't have much affect as you already well know. Have you considered a mental health consult with a Psychologist or a Psychiatrist? Have you also considered the possibilty that her not taking care of herself is a manipulation attempt to keep you from moving away especially if this has been an ongoing discussion and her behavior has worsened in that period of time? I would suggest obtaining some outside support, Diabetes education, and mental health services to help you help her. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

He is 32, poor health due to congenital heart disease, secondary pulmonary hypertension, and os now in heart failure and on COREG 25mg 2x a day. (as well as lanoxin and vasotec).He is 6 ft 3 and 168 lbs.   His blood test results indicate (non fasting) he is hypoglycemic it was 59. I believe they said his insullin level was high. he goes the 6th for a GTT.  He also had abnormal result on RBC, HG and Hematocrits.  RBC 6.1 HG 20 Hematocrits 63.6  last year  HG was 19.7 heamotcrits 59.3   (I might have HG and hematocrit levels reversed. I don't think I do... but I might.    Could he be diabetic?  Headaches are frequent, irritability often and his personality is different.. moody I guess... which is not good..   He also complains of confusion, (of cloudy feeling)  His mother had diabetes when she went into heart failure. and when she got a heart transplant. the diabetes went away? Never heard of this before but I am dure you have.   What do you make of this?  Could it be diabetes because his hematocrits are high and puts him at risk, since his heart is failing ?

He does not eat sweets of any kind.... once in a long while he will have a candy bar but that is very rare. He has even cut out sodas and drinks more water   Could this have anything to do with his Hematicrits being severely high as well as Hemoglobins?

My doctor has increased  my Enalapril to 20 mg a day, but is there other things I can be doing to lower my levels? I don't want my kidneys to fail. I have been diabetic for 43 years now and am 49 years old, had a heart attack when i was around 35 and started losing my sight when i was 21.

    "content": "Dear Dabbie,  First of all make it clear, that the creatinine level is only an 'estimated' test to assess kidney function. It is influenced by a wide variety of factors eg your hydration status at the time of test etc.   However, a rising creatinine level is regarded as a worsening of kidney function.  For diabetics, a more important test to monitor along with creatinine is Urine complete analysis for proteins (results are as +,++,+++) or the more specific 24 hour urine proteins (results in specific value of mmol/l). I'd recommend to get this test done, or give the value here if already performed.  Another thing that bothers me, is that are you aware of the fact that the target blood pressure in diabetics is less than 125/85? If enalapril alone is not sufficient, a second drug might need to be added.  High blood pressure, smoking and poor glucose control are major   contributors to worsen kidney function. Drinking water or certain food types..well there is no evidence regarding that.  You have mentioned your pressure to be 150/60, right? Did you have an echocardiogram done? I'd like to have it done.

    "content": "Hi, All the drugs you have mentioned are mainly removed by the liver. Except for two: Metformin and enalapril. Generally, the diabetologists stop metformin when creatinine is around 150, increasing insulin to control diabetes. The same is true for enalapril (or any drugs of this class; ACE inhibitors)  You have mentioned diltiazem 180mg once a day and 120mg once a day??  Consider getting urine for proteins, and echocardiogram. And the lower the BP, the safer you are.Target: <125/85. Your physician is the best person to decide how to titrate your medicine to achieve that target, inspite of the stress.  Any queries are welcome. Najaf Haider MBBS     Hello I tried to answer your answer to my posts, but it said there was  an  error and couldn't connect to the data base so I'm sending this to you  here I posted this in the Diabetic forum about CAN I LOWER MY CREATININE  LEVEL  Thank  you for your response. No, I didn't  know about the urine test  and I  didn't know about the need for a lower blood pressure. I am on 10 mg of  isodil 3 times a day, diltiazam 180 once a day and 120 mg once a day.  Also  nitro patches which I believe also can lower the bp.  My bp was pretty normal but in October my mother died and family  matters in  that regard have put me under a lot of stress having to do with lawyers  etc  so that is what has caused my bp to go up so high. I have my bp checked  every Tuesday so I am keeping an eye on it and will see my family  doctor in  a month.  I had these blood tests done in November but did not find out the  results  until I went into the doctor's office just last week, no one called to  tell  me the results even though I had called and asked about them and was  told by  the secretary they were ok.  When I go back in Feb. I will ask about the urine test and I will  mention  what u said about the bp too.  I have not had an echocardiogram  done in a quite a few years. I don't  know  if the tech who use to do that comes to town anymore. I live in a small  Northern Ontario town, pop 9,000 so we don't have a lot of these tests  available here. I will mention it also to my gp next time I see him.  Someone also mentioned that some meds might be harder on the kidneys  than  others. I'm on a lot of pills and perhaps they are putting a strain on  them  too?  zorcor, lorazapam, insulin of course,  enalapril, isodil, metformin,  metoprolol, pantoloc, questran, sulcrate then different vitamins, E , multiples and halibut oil  Thank you for your help.

    "content": "Howdy:  I'm a fifty-six year old male, a licensed professional,  exercise frequently, am in excellent health according to my doc, and like to track my health attentively.  I recently took a Quest men's health profile for my own benefit but also to keep tracking my serum glucose level which my doc noticed last year was 107 (fasting). It took me by surprise but since my brother is a diabetic, insulin dependent just recently at 65, I imagine I am a good candidate for type II as well.  I take Avalide (which has a little HCTZ in it) as well as Crestor and Zetia. The latter chol drugs because although my total chol is 125 with my HDL at 54 and LDL at 52 we are working to make my NMR lipo profile read a little better. I also use androgel: a cream for testesterone replacement.  I am not a hypochondriac but I do want to take control of my health with my doc's assistance.  Anyway, this last health profile showed an eleven-hour fasting glucose at 100 with an A1C at 5.7%. If you read their library, the AiC indicates I have good control on my glucose.  Anyway, I sent the results to my doc and we will discuss them at my annual in two months but I found this forum and thought I may get an informed response:  I had a kidney health panel, thyroid panel, cbc, anemia, electrolyte, liver, thyroid, urinalysis, vitamin B12 and folate. The only values outside the reference range on the three page report were my BUN at 26 and the glucose at 100. (one over the normal range in each case)  Since BUN relates to kidney = diabetes, I wonder if the HCTZ in my blood pressure med is dehydrating me too much (especially out here in CO at altitude!). Also, can't the steroidal androgel raise my glucose?  Herre's my other kidney health panel values:  albumin           4.6 creatinine       1.2 uric acid         7.7  Any thoughts? I realize this is for discussion purposes only and I will rely on my doc but I would like to discuss the subject intelligently with him.  Thank you,  Capt. Delta\n\n",

Yes, steroids really raise your blood glucose, and a fasting value of 100 is just, hmm, satisfactory.  Regarding BUN and creatinine, first of all we need a previous reading of your kidney profile. Although seemingly elevated when seeing the refernce values, this might be your normal values. So what is important is that have these values risen from before? then only it means a deteriorating function of kidneys. get my point? and secondly, BUN and especially creatinine is elevated after exercise. Are you sure you hadnt exerted a little extra physically when you took that test!  Uric acid is in upper limits for men. but, Blood uric acid levels can increase during hydrochlorothiazide treatment.   moreover, i'd really like to know your serum electrolytes.  i hope that answers your query. You can of course do a detailed discussion with your doc.  Najaf Haider MBBS\n\n",

    "content": "hi there  the fact that anyone sprains one's joint leads to 'tear' or 'tension'  in the ligaments that hold the joints together.  this results in an inflammatory response calling all repair cells to the damaged site.  this pain is normal which you have noticed even before keeping the foot down. as this must be caused by 'over' sensitization of the pain receptors at damaged site.   keep your diabetes in control, because a bad diabetes impairs repair. And i don't think you have to worry about this pain. it 'll settle with time.  Najaf Haider MBBS\n\n",

I have been diabetic for ten years now and I would say I have pretty good contraol of it.  I used to live in Toronto so I can't help you with a doctor in the B.C. area.  But on your next visit to your endo ask about Lantus.  It's a relatively new insulin in Canada, I think it got approved about 4 or 5 months ago.  It's really good because it last for 24 hours so you'l save yourself some jabs.  Also ask about Novorapid, this is a fast acting insulin that last for about  1 hour, it's used only for meals.  I find that 1 unit of Novorapid covers about 15 grams of carbohydrate.  Good Luck littlebuddy\n\n",

My mom was very active until this year when she has been in a lot of pain (leg, hip). She is now using a walker as she can not lift her one leg.   She has lost over 40 lbs in 9 months &r 4 lbs in the last 2 wks.  She is down to 121 lbs.  She has had x-rays, MRI's, bone density tests, and has been to a neurologist.  Nobody can seem to figure out why the weight loss. Could this much loss be from the diabetes?  She does monitor it very well and takes some medication, but no insulin.  What type of a specialist would you recommend for a diagnosis as the doctor she has been seeing has never come in the room to speak to her, only the Phy. Assist.  They live in Rogers, AR 72758.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank You!\n\n",

    "title": "diabetes and erectile dysfunction",
    "content": "My 53 year old husband was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 7 years ago. Since then he has kept his blood sugar under control (mostly), faithfully taken his medications, and lost nearly 50 pounds.  Unfortunately in the last 2 years there have been increasing episodes of erectile dysfunction. Erections that sometimes fade to nothing during sex and aren't as full as they used to be. Difficulty in achieving errection even when desire and stimulation are there.  I understand the ED can be associated with diabetes. We were told that if the proscribed treatment were followed the diabetes would be controlled. I don't fully understand the connection between diabetes and ED, and the situation certainly seems to be deteriorating. I fear that it may get worse still. This is a frightening vision of our future intimacy.  Here are my questions: 1) If the diabetes is under control, why does the erectile dysfunction seem to be worsening?  2) Outside of taking even more drugs (Viagra etc. which are expensive and inconvenient ) how may we improve the frequency and reliability of erections?   3) Is this permanent, and inevitably going to get progressively worse? Can we arrest or reverse the problem?  Unfortunately, we have limited access to quality healthcare. We currently live in the Russian Federation where health care is basic, and the few western clinics which operate here are exceedingly expensive and staffed by non-English speaking doctors. Good European doctors to be sure, but the language barrier is difficult to bridge. So just popping down to the local clinic really isn't an option.  Thank you so much for you anticipated reply.\n\n",

    "title": "Hypoglycemia is rare!",
    "content": "Dear Friend,  From the values that you have quoted, it seems that you are not diabetic. Hypoglycemia in normal individuals is something to be investigated. However, you haven't mentioned the readings of the GTT you did. Also, the post-prandial sugar being lower than fasting can be due to reactive hypoglycemia. Are you in ideal body weight for your height? If you are obese, insulin resistance might be the reason for reactive hypoglycemia. Even then, at least one value in your GTT should be more than 160. Let me know these details.  Anyway, you must consult a good general physician with HbA1c, fasting and post-prandial blood tests after 10 hours overnight fasting. The sample must be given early in the morning. If all these are normal, you are not diabetic. Then you can ask your physician to evaluate your other parameters. Let me know what happened.  Good luck! Get well soon!  Yours Sincerely, Dr J Vijay Venkatraman. vijay@ktvr.com\n\n",

Also, the only effect that Diabetes can have in this regard is impotence, which is partly psychological. Even then, it cannot have any effect on the size.   Please stop worrying if your diabetic control is good. If so, it means you will have normal functioning of all these systems. If you are not in good control or want to know how your control is, consult your diabetologist or physician.  Kindly reply if you have any doubts!

    "content": "Hi there. I am a 32 year old female,good health. Having symptoms of hypoglycemia. Started in August of 2004. My family doctor ordered an A1C and fasting blood sugar. I know that the test results were \"negative for diabetes\",but the morning I went in for the fasting test, I had a reading of only 74 (and felt pretty good which makes me wonder how low it was when I feel really bad). He recommended that I watch my diet (which I have done),and I did feel better for a couple of months. However the symptoms have returned. I am having dizziness,sweating,nausea,shakiness,feeling hot,and occassionally crying spells and irritability which seem to be relieved when I eat something. Should I go back for the same round of tests? What else could it be? What should I ask him to test for if there are any other suggestions? Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "title": "Do OGTT to confirm Diabetes!",
    "content": "Dear Friend,  Let me answer your questions, though it's quite a long time that you posted this message. First of all, an A1C value of less than 6% means that you are not a diabetic. Further, a fasting value of 74 mg/dl is not absolutely low. It can be considered relatively low for a person who is a diabetic and has taken an overdose of oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin the previous night.  Your symptoms are suggestive but not specific for Diabetes and hypoglycemia. Do you have a family history of Diabetes from either parent's side? Are you in ideal weight for your height? These are all more important when you think of Diabetes.  So, I suggest that you go for an Oral glucose Tolerance Test, which is the gold standard test for diagnosing Diabetes. Along with that, you can do a fasting lipid profile, repeat your A1C (preferably in another laboratory), kidney function tests, liver function tests, serum electrolytes and a complete urine examination. Further tests can be decided by your physician when you meet him or her, based on your symptoms, physical examination and the investigation reports.  Let me know the results too! Good luck! Get well soon!  Yours Sincerely, Dr J Vijay Venkatraman. vijay@ktvr.com\n\n",

I have had a fasting glucose test that came out normal, but I feel fine before I eat it is after that I feel horrible.

Creatinine is one of the markers of kidney function and a high value is indicative of an acute or chronic kidney ailment. Are you referring to oral thrush? Can you state your age, sex and risk factors?  Are you immunocompromised by any current illness that you are aware of ?   I would have expected that with this list of complaints over the past 5 years, you would have been clinically evaluated by a physician. If not, why has there been a delay?

    "content": "Yes the creatinine was high at 339. Not only oral thrush but constant yeast infections. the thrush didn't start developing till three years ago, and I know what your thinking; what about an HIV test? Every doctor I go to that seems to be the one thing they want to check for and so a big negative on that one. Since my husband got out of the military we have not had health insurance but will be getting it in oct. It has only just been this year that the eye problem, leg problem, and the problem with after I eat has developed, which the leg problem seems to be vascular in nature. I am 39 years old, am mexican/german, 92lbs, I have seizure disorder, osteoarthritis, polycystic ovaries(had partial hysterectomy) and have developed kidneystones in the past. Had it not been for how I feel after I eat and the fact I cannot put weight that I have lossed back on, and chronic ketones in urine, I wouldn't worry about diabetes. On the mexican side (mom's) she has two brother's with it, she refuses to test so I don't know about her. On dad's side my grandmother had it. Dad died before i was born so don't know whether he would have possibly had it, but what I do know is that I feel so bad at times, I feel like I am going to die, so if you have any suggestions let me know!\n\n",

On waking (fasting) my fiance's BS was 157, and mine was 154.  We had a muffin for breakfast, then about 45min to an hour later we tested again and his was 154 and mine 106.  Fiance has no symptoms, but I have a lot of them, including blurry vision.  My vision has been perfect all of my life (I'm 44 in September), but over the last couple of years it's been getting steadily worse, and now I can't read price tag stickers or the back of a shampoo bottle.  I've given up my life-long love of reading due to this.  Even the buttons on the car stereo are impossible for me to read (same with my cell phone).  The majority of eyesight changes in me have occured in the last couple of months.  Thanks in advance for any advice.  Autumn\n\n",

Your physician should do blood work on you to determine hormone levels, looking for thyroid problems as well as other causes for your abnormalities. The actual use of METFORMIN (Glucophage) to treat menstruation problems is still being evaluated and studied; it isn\u2019t intended to correct this type of problem at this time. So, unless your irregularity or amenorrhea is being caused by something METFORMIN can alter, it may not be the answer for you. Your doctor can give you more insight on the update of Metformin uses.\n\n",

I went out and purchased an A1C test kit. I did the test as instructed... although after collecting the blood and squeezing the tube into the dilution tube, the blood came out as a clotted tube. I shook and shook the vial, but it would not dissolve.. I continued the test and squeezed the appropriate amount onto the test monitor, making sure that I included the clot of blood. I waited the 8 minutes, and it did not show an error... it did show 5.9% . Could the test have gone wrong because of the clot not dissolving? Also if it was accurate... I have been reading that anything over 5.4 % is pre diabetes... is that true? should I also do a urine test on him?Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Are there any other health problems with your son other than obesity?  Do you give him sugar?  Gatorade is made mostly of glucose; probably not a good idea to give him on an empty stomach unless he was in danger of being dehydrated from excessive vomiting, diarrhea or persistent high fever.  It can cause nausea/vomiting due to the high glucose content.   Unless it was recommended by your doctor, fruit juice would be a better choice for breakfast.  With the difficulty you had, the test was more than likely false.  It wouldn't have necessarily showed an error.  The A1c doesn't show the actual blood glucose at the time, only the average percentage over the last 2-3 months, and is not used to diagnose diabetes.  The way diabetes is diagnosed is a blood glucose level after fasting for at least 10 hours, not after anything to eat or drink.  Also, type II diabetes occurs in middle age; type I is the form children develop.  Your doctor was probably trying to warn you about future health problems if he remains overweight, since overweight children are usually overweight adults.  You would probably do well to have your son checked for his stomach pain and diabetic status at his doctor's office, and follow a prescribed diet plan to get and keep your son at a healthy weight.  I hope this helps.  Shannon\n\n",

(normally higher number for younger children, or unstable diabetes) Type one is not due to being overweight or too much sugar in diet- these are common misconceptions. It is not known exactly what triggers this condition- however it is not as a result of 'un healthy lifestyles'  type two is either heredity or as a result of lifestyle- obesity etc. It is most common in middle aged people, however there has been an increase in the rate of children and adolescents being diagnosed with this condition. Type 2 can be controlled with weight loss, exercise, diet, oral medication or if the condition remains unstable, it can lead to the use of insulin via injections.   i am not being rude- i just hoped to clarify a few things.\n\n",

    "content": "My mistake, thanks Kirsty for the clarification.  The rest stands, however.  Generally 4-6% is considered the normal range for people without diabetes; diabetics can be within 1% of this range (higher) and be considered well controlled.  Every lab has slightly different \"normal\" ranges, however, depending upon the method used to calculate.  At home kits can be more prone to inaccurate readings because of \"operator error\".  Diabetes cannot be diagnosed on A1c readings, again generally two fasting glucose levels are required for formal diagnosis.  The increased thirst and urination can be symptoms of diabetes, but all the symptoms you list are common in young children and really don't mean much without the fasting glucose levels to confirm.  As far as diet goes, obviously completely eliminate any type of refined sugar (sweets, soda) and \"bad\" carbs like any type of white bread, pasta, white rice, potatoes, and cereals with sugar.  Learn to read labels carefully. Sugar, including corn syrup, is an ingredient in almost everything you can buy; look for sugar free versions, but still be aware of corn syrup.  You can find many, many sugar free and whole wheat versions at Whole Foods, or any health food store.  The \"good\" carbs are whole wheat (not just wheat) bread, brown rice, whole grain cereals. Homemade oats, even quick oats, not the box flavored variety is the best choice of all, the most nutritious and the most fiber with protein and has no sugar.   You can use Splenda to sweeten anything.  Limit fruit juices as they are mostly fructose which is a sugar, so small quantities are plenty.  Include plenty of leafy greens and vegetables.  Lean meats broiled, baked or grilled are recommended, not fried.  Dairy is important, of course, but buy the fat free versions.  Basically a diabetic diet is recommended for everyone, not just diabetics.  Be sure to limit portions, too much of this diet is also not good.  Ask your doctor for a referral to a nutritionist or look on the web for correct portions for adults and children.  You will lose weight on this \"diet\"; it is not a fad diet and is for life.  I hope this helps.    Shannon\n\n",

    "title": "Long term weight problem; Can my Metabolism be measured?",
    "content": "I  have been overweight since I was four years old.  When I was eight years old, I became  bulimic and did this for at least four years.  As a teenager I avoided food altogether and took over-the-counter diet pills.   I moved in with my boyfriend when I was twenty years old and tried to get pregnant.  After months of trying, I starting looking at what I was doing that might be the problem for my infertility.  I started to eat healthier, but the sudden food intake made me gain thirty pounds in one month.  In the past thirteen years, I gained another twenty five..  I am now thirty three years old,  I weigh 200 pounds and still infertile.   Finally:  My concerns and questions! 1).   I have been actively exercising at least five times a week for a at least ten years  yet nothing budges off my midsection.  My legs and arms are shapely and slender, my butt is flat as my back but my stomach bulges out like I'm full term.    2).   I am  thinking about getting liposuction and a breast reduction but I get keloid scar tissue.  Will this prevent me from breast feeding?  Can I take lots of vitatimin E and C to avoid keloids?  3).    I am also thinking about joining a \"prepackaged food\" weight loss program and I worry still if I eat too few calories, I will just teach my body to lower its metabolism even more.  I wonder if my metabolism can be measured before hand so I know what MY calorie intake should be.  4).   If I have been eating @ 1,200 calories a day for years, what will my metabolism do? I am concern if I finally get pregnant and changing my calorie intake;  I will just double in size!  Thank you for reading this long post, Merry Robin PS Im not diabetic,,,just concern I fit the profile.\n\n",

    "content": "First of all, if you are eating 1200 calories a week and excercising 5 times a week, you are not getting enough calories to provide the energy you need, there going into starvation mode and hoarding them as fat.  It won't let go of any fat, it takes from muscle tissue, where glycogen is stored (a sugar).  If you know how to eat healthy, step up the good carbs.  Eat more protein.  Have 4-5 little meals of protein, fruit and/or veggies with good carbs. (Do you know the difference?)  Step up the calories, not reduce the exercise!    If you count calories now, eat at least 15-1800 per day.  Your speed of metabolism can't be measured, it depends on your level of activity.    As far as your body shape, you're an apple (fat is stored around the middle, small butt, thin legs), you will lose from your arms, butt, hips and legs first, then you will start losing from your midsection.  It is the highest risk for cancer, diabetes,heart disease.  There is absolutely nothing you can do to change this, but when you get to a healthier weight, it's an extremely attractive body shape; many actresses have this shape, but take the thinness to the extreme.  Don't bother spot reducing or taking pills that claim to.   I am so glad to hear that you are trying to get fit the healthy way instead of those ridiculous fad diets that I'm sure you know by now do not work.  This lifestyle is easy and get results.  It works forever if you continue!    As for the infertility, you may have a problem such as polycystic ovarian syndrome.  Overweight very stubborn is one feature.  Do you have irregular and/or very heavy periods, acne, maybe hairier than you'd like?  Have you seen a GYN about your infertility?  Has she tested you for POS?  Ask a plastic surgeon or dermatologist about keloid scarring after liposuction, I'm not sure.\n\n",

About ten years ago I had a gynecologist that took my concern seriously.  She tested my hormone levels and looked at my ovaries.  I remember she said that the hormones where normal and that I did have cysts on my ovaries, but nothing to be concern about.  I have very irregular periods.  I have very light bleeding for two to three weeks and  4-6 week intervals.  As for being hairy and acne prone; just the opposite. I never had acne problem, just occasional whitehead around my nose.    I shave much less often than other girls.  I can got without shaving a whole summer and its barely visible (on my legs I\u2019m talking about =p).\n\n",

    "content": "Good; POS can cause great difficulty with fertility.  Are you still trying?  Have you been trying most of the last ten years?  When is the last time you saw a GYN for the infertility problem?  Do you know when you are ovulating?  Irregular periods can definitely change the times you ovulate; but there is a method to determine when you are.  My concern is you bleeding for weeks at a time.  That is definitely not normal, and there is a reason for that.  Were you having the exact same problem when your GYN said you were completely normal?  A lot can change in ten years!  Have you considered seeing a fertility specialist?  They can usually get to the bottom of things.  If you have been trying for a long time, it could be your partner's lack of sperm that is the problem; he will need to be tested for that.  I know I have a lot of questions, please get back and perhaps I could be of more help.   Shannon\n\n",

My question is does this this seem like Insulin Resistance? What about possibility of PCOS? Or are above tests actually indicative of diabetes? I have read treatment of IR would improve with metformin(which would also check hirtuism,and hairloss,acanthos nigricans, and decrease weight). Is this recommended therapy? Tammy\n\n",

    "content": "Hi tammyinwv, Insulin resistance in PCOS is commonly treated with medications such as Metformin. If polycystic ovary syndrome is related to insulin resistance women are at a higher risk for developing other disorders that have been linked to insulin resistance such as diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol and triglycerides, and heart disease. The excess insulin that the pancreas produces to keep blood sugar levels near to normal also stimulates the ovary to produce more testosterone which would explain some of your other symptoms. Your glucose tolerance test does appear impaired. The use of medications that improve insulin sensitivity is a relatively common treatment in PCOS. As for illness elevating blood sugar levels, this is true, but seen at more significant levels and more often in the diabetic population than in nondiabetics, unless steroids are used in the treatment of an illness. I hope this was helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hi courage, You were told correctly. Ketosis is considerably dangerous. This is essentially what happens to your body. Ketosis occurs when the amount of carbohydrates ( the fuel that required to make the body function) drops below a critical level. This forces the body to turn to protein and then to the bodies fat stores to do the work carbohydrates do. When protein is deviated in this manner, it releases nitrogen into the blood stream, placing a burden on the kidneys as they try to expell excessive urinary water due to the loss of sodium. When fat is likewise deviated, the breakup releases fatty acids, or ketones, into the bloodstream, which causes a further burden on the kidneys. If ketosis continues for long periods of time, serious damage to the liver and kidneys may occur. Most low-carbohydrate diets recommend only short-term use, typically 14 days. Many nutritionists warn patients, (especially women in the early stages of pregnancy) against following them at all.  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I must admit you are very keen on knowing what may be the matter with your daughter,  and I respect that very much! However, you must know I am not here to diagnose but to guide you to a solution and may be make things clearer. I still have a few questions unanswered, such as, was this neurological deficit of your daugther ever investigated. Other than the MRI, what explanation was given for the delayed mentality & difficult coordination? You mentioned there was difficult transition & low oxygen saturation, how long did that last , & could that have affected her brain? As regards the constipation, are her stools of narrow calibre, & what kind of GI studies were done? Just mention the name of the studies, if possible. Also, was she ever given cow's milk? The excessive urination, has that been investigated?  The rash & mouth blisters, what explanation was given for that? Now the simplest explanation would be, if we decide to put aside the neurological deficit, is that the change in diet shortly after birth & abuse of laxatives may have caused her constant constipation. Prolonged stool retention results in a vicious cycle of retained stools, painful defecation, resisting the urge to defecate, further retention of stools, & so on. This should explain the severe pain she suffers. On the other hand,children with neurological impairment of any cause, are at risk for constipation from poor GI motility and impaired sensation. Bed wetting may then result from stool impaction from chronic constipation. On the other hand, excessive urination due to  an underlying disease process may be the cause of her failure to thrive, excessive drinking of water & constipation would then result from dehydration. If your daughter is stressed from all these problems, she would eat a lot, too. As for the blood glucose levels, they are quite normal and diabetes mellitus is a remote possibility, since this is a longstanding condition, and there are other criteria for diagnosis\n\n",

If your father has \"sores\" or ulcers that aren't healing with the current treatment, it of course needs changed. There are many treatments that can be tried, a wet to dry drsg, hydrogel, whirlpool therapy, etc., to name a few. As for prevention, if he is bed ridden, a turning schedule for the staff, preventing friction shears from linens, and padded side rails are a few suggestions. You may want to consider talking to the staff as well as his doctor about his nutrition and the other treatment options for ulcer healing. Hope this helps\n\n",

If your sister isn't a teenager yet, some endocrinologist like to keep the blood sugar levels not under a very strict regimen for fear of low blood sugar which can have very bad effects on the brain.  i think that your sister is followed by an endocrinologist and i think she should be fine. Go with her to her doctor so that you find out exactly what is needed and try to help her achieve those goals as much as you can.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello! Im hoping to find some help here...here lately (past few weeks) I've been waking up with nausia. I have a feeling like there is a lump in my throat, similar to the feeling i have before i've had to vomit. About 2 years ago i was having fainting spells, i still get dizzy quite frequently and light headed but i don't think this problem is the same. Yesterday, on the way home from school, i fell asleep on the bus. My bus is very loud. This may mean nothing, i guess, but  i've never been able to do that before. Fatigue? Maybe? I take naps from time to time when im suddenly tired. Sometimes i have diarrhea or loose stools, alot after i eat. That has been ongoing for several months though.  I had lost about 40 lbs over this year. Today i checked the scales and i was back at 280. Just a month ago i was 260. Very good for me, i've always been an overweight child. I do have little attacks sometimes, where i shake and get very sick at my stomach and become dizzy....my family tells me im hypoglycemic. I have a lot of diabetics througout my family so i have had my sugar level checked  before. Its always 80 or 90. Normal, i've heard. My family members have like 200 though! Im not big on sugar, i avoid it as much as possible. Simply because i do not care for it. I would rather eat my rice crispies without sugar rather than froot loops or any similar cereal. I thought maybe my eating habbits could be the cause of this....on weekdays i rarely eat breakfast because im nausias.....i only eat lunch at school occasionally and i always eat dinner at my house. Mom thinks i could be dehydrated because i was having pains yesterday in my leg muscles....and a feeling that was similar to the way your finger feels when its jammed. My mom asked me if i could be pregnant. It is impossible, i am a virgin. I looked  up the signs of pregnancy and i do have a few. Nausia, no period(in a while, mine are irregular anyways), increased abdomanial area(i know i've gained weight, don't know how i have, but my stomach feels tight and hard, not normal) fatigue,and the whole stuff coming from the breast if you squeeze. Im not sure how normal that is. There is no possible way it could be pregnancy, i have never had intercourse. I have had dreams where i've been pregnnant and have woke up still thinking it for awhile, then reality kicked in. I've heard of peoples bodies telling it that their pregnant and it goes through the stages ...but no baby. Like fake pregnancy. Im just trying to lay down the possiblities here. My Mom is obsessing that i have diarrhea from time to time, but thats not all....its not the main thing, the nausia is. I have had blood and a mucus looking material in my stools before. Is that serious? The  1st time was after i had surgery. Effect of that maybe? I don't know what is wrong with me......i would appreciate any help you could give me. I have tried to tell you as much as i could in one post. Hope you can help! Thanks for your time, -Beth\n\n",

I am TRYING to keep myself hydrated (I feel very dehydrated) but I throw up the water I drink. My sugar was high this morning above 280, but I am now 168 without extra insulin. I feel very very weak, nauseous and I feel as if I am going to faint - laying down does no good either.  We just purchased a small puppy from a pet store 2 days ago. I have no idea if I could have gotten this from him somehow but my husband is fine. We do have suspicions that the puppy has round worm b/c of its bloated tummy.  I have had similar episodes such as this before, but it seems once I get an IV on I feel fine a few hours later. I can't go to the hosp. right now though & I am away from familly.  PLEASE offer me some suggestions.   Elizabeth\n\n",

    "content": "For the last year and half I have been plagued with UTI's. This last week I developed the 4th one. When I went to the dr. tonight and asked why I have gotten so many in the last year and half, they started looking at the results of the urinalysis a little better and found that there are ketones and glucose in my urine (along with several other things) The Dr. at that point left the room to ask one of the nurses to do a finger stick and one of the other dr.'s asked what was going on. (she left the door open so I was able to see the entire conversation) When my dr. told the other dr. what was found in my urine she got a very concerned look on her face and started asking about different test that have or have not performed. At this point I am quite concerned just because I saw the other dr.'s facial expression.  They are doing some blood work on monday and have ordered \"CBC, CMP, T4 TSH, FLP\" Can you tell me what these tests are looking for and what the ketones, glucose, blood (and I think protein and leukocytes) in my urine mean? Thanks!\n\n",

I am glad that your results came out fine. Have they ruled out diabetes altogether. Now, it all depends on how much protein and blood you have in urine. If significant then a kidney biopsy may be required.\n\n",

    "content": "I Live a very hectic lifestyle and on top of that, I am a picky eater. Therefore, I skip alot of meals, occasionally even skip dinner and then breakfast the next day. I eat very little meat and alot of fast food. I have 3 children and during 2 of those pregnancies, I had very sever hyperemesis,which required hospitalization. Also during pregnancy, I have had anemia.  Since, my eating habits are what they are, I do suffer from dizziness quite often. Well, twice in the last month and a half, I have had a week long bout of nausea, shakiness, severe headache, dizziness, slightly blurred vision, and sleepiness. I also woke up last night several times feeling like I hadn't even just been sleeping. (At the beggining of the last one, I also had an episode of vomiting, which occurred after my boyfriend told me to take some nyquil, so it may have just been the nyquil causing the vomiting.)  I have had migraines in the past and am sure these are not migraines. The second episode ended today right after i ate half of a can of crushed pineapple. I forced myself to eat part of a sandwhich from subway and felt slightly better last night but within ten minutes of eating the pineapple today i was feeling 100% better, although wery weak. I don't have health insurance and so don't want to spend a bunch of money to go to the doctor if this is all just because of my eating habits or in some way psychological as someone i know has suggested. Can anyone help?\n\n",

    "content": "I understand your concern about spending money on medical assessment, being uninsured. Your vomiting bouts could be psychogenic or they could be due to a serious underlying disease. There is nothing I can tell you here that could clarify what the cause is without a direct medical examination. However, I think you should go for a blood glucose test but not to exclude hypoglycemia as much as to exclude the opposite, diabetes. Once that is cleared I would suggest that your eating habits be regulated. 3 meals a day of healthy food. You should also exercise once EVERY day. If after you do this you get another bout of vomiting you must seek medical help at once. It could be something more serious.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Angie, Insulin as you know by now is a normal hormone in the body that responds to increases in blood levels of sugar. This normally happens after a meal. Insulin does a lot more beside regulate blood sugar in the body. Diabetes is caused by the lack of insulin in the body. Hence when you stop taking your insulin you become 'diabetic' again. Your blood sugar rises and your metabolism becomes disturbed. If your blood sugar remains constantly irregular this has devastating complications. In the short term this could eventually lead to coma. In the long term it affects your vision, your kidneys, heart, even your intelligence. When these organs become damaged by diabetes there is very little that can be done to correct them. Diabetics can lead a normal life; however, only by carefully taking their insulin so that their insulin levels is similar to a normal person's insulin levels.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear kidofking,  For diabetes to be affecting the eyes would usually take 15 years and depends on the control one has over the blood sugar. Hypertension has synergistic effect on the eyes with diabetes, i.e., systemic hypertension, especially in the setting of renal affection by diabetes, correlates well with the presence of retinopathy (diseased retina of eye). Independently, hypertension also may complicate diabetes in that it may result in hypertensive retinal vascular changes superimposed on the preexisting diabetic retinopathy further compromising retinal blood flow.   Other diabetic diseases affecting the eyes include corneal abnormalities, glaucoma, cataracts, iris neovascularization, neuropathies, etc. Anyways, you should take a look into your ophthalmologist soon.  As for the tingling and numbing sensation, both the hypertension and diabetes could cause disease of the nerves (neuropathy) which is partially amenable to treatment with the B complex vitamins, but if your tingling and numbing turns painful, other drugs like tricyclic antidepressant group may prove helpful.   So, is your blood sugar and blood pressure well controlled??\n\n",
