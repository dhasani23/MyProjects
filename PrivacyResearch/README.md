Web scraper used to exhaustively extract data from www.doctorslounge.com/forums, such as the posts, user profiles, and images. Developed with Beautiful Soup as a part of the privacy-related research that I conducted at UVA to investigate leakages in personally identifiable information (PII). In total (across 3 different websites), I analyzed ~1.5M posts, ~200K user profiles, and ~100K images.
