Web crawler used to extract data from www.doctorslounge.com/forums, such as: the category, subcategory, url, title, time, and content of ≈74,000 posts; the name, age, job, email, location, and medical history of up to ≈66,000 authors; and images on the website. Developed as a part of privacy-related research I am conducting at UVA to investigate potential leakages in personally identifiable information (PII).
