Web scraper used to exhaustively extract data from www.doctorslounge.com/forums, such as the category, subcategory, url, title, time, and content of several tens of thousands of posts; the name, age, job, email, location, and medical history of several tens of thousands of authors; and many images on the website. Developed as a part of privacy-related research I am conducting at UVA to investigate potential leakages in personally identifiable information (PII).
